0: BytesRefHash is an internal Lucene class , essentially providing a compact representation of Map < BytesRef , int > .
1: It already has a public sort method , which destructively compacts all entries and returns them , but its compact method -LRB- which compacts all entries without the cost of sorting -RRB- is not public ... I 'd like to make it public , and also mark it @lucene .
2: I do n't mind making it public .
3: The whole class is already tagged with @lucene .
