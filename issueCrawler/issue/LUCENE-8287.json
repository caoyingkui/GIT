Note that to reproduce, Java assertions must be enabled (as in the default configuration for tests).\n\nThe patch also provides\u00a0a test case for the normal behavior of an empty RegexCompletionQuery, when it is not wrapped in ContextQuery (TestRegexCompletionQuery#testEmptyRegexQuery). In this case, there is no error, and all suggestions are returned.",
