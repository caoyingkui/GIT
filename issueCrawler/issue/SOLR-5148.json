            "content": "Just looked through the patch and have some hint: it's worth to return empty collection in case of no children docs. It will help to avoid this weird null checks. (Joshua Bloch writes about it in his \"Effective Java\" book)\n\nhttp://books.google.ru/books?id=ka2VUBqHiWkC&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=joshua+bloch+return+empty+collection&source=bl&ots=yYJoIjtZR3&sig=zRFogOMltXze3fEei20ZqiOVo9A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=urkyUpyzDoqC4gSfuYCoBg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=joshua%20bloch%20return%20empty%20collection&f=false\n\nIt means that internally you can still have null childrenDocuments, but null check should be done only in getters. All external code should work with non null collection.\n\nWhat do you think? "
