Is this something I am supposed to handle myself (I looked, but don't see how).",

As each node is brought up for the first time it takes (in order), shard2, replica1, then replica2.\n\nI'd like to note I'm also having another problem that is only happening on 4.1 (not 4.0), and I'm starting to think it could be related: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201301.mbox/browser "
