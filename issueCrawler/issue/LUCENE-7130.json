    "description": "Followup from LUCENE-7127:\n\nI had to remove some distance query optimizations for correctness. According to benchmarks it hurt performance. We can win back half of it by just syncing up with LatLonPoint's distance optimizations.\n\nThen separately from this, we can investigate trying to safely implement some of what it was trying to do before (and add to both impls).",
