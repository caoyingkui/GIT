First off, we have at least one user who was using it and now misses it... second off, we are uncertain still how LUCENE-2154 will/should be solved, or even when it will be.\n\nIn the worst case, we would simply declare (in the future) that this UnionDocsAndPositions cannot handle attrs at all, and it'll still be a useful class, right?
