    "description": "Today we have 3 different kinds of FilterIndexReader. While FilterDirecotryReader\n    and FilterLeafReader are simple to distinguish, FilterCodecReader make decision harder\n    since now we need instanceof checks to deside which unwrap method we should call. This\n    adds a simple interface that allows to build generic unwrap methods to access the delegat\n    of each of the filtering readers.",

I wonder if you would ever see this interface if you don't work with expert API. In this case I think we just make our live easier without risking anything. ",
