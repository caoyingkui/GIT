It's an improvement over OpenBitSet, without needing to use fastXYZ\n\tI think that we can initialize the scores array to maxDoc, and drop the resizing in collect \u2013 collect is a hot method, we should do minimal work there. If someone want to keep scores for maxDoc documents, we should initialize the array up front.\n\n ",

IMHO that's a waste for a large index. While allocating a large array is faster, it takes a lot of memory - probably for no reason. Each query will take longer, but concurrent queries will not hurt the GC that much. If the index is large concurrent queries might hit the GC hard, perhaps even OOM ? I must admit I never measured the reallocation penalty. ",

Therefore it doesn't need to be of size maxDoc, but rather close to how many docs were visited.\n\nMakes sense I guess for queries that hit a low percentage of the index. I'm not worried about the re-allocation work at all ... I didn't dig deep into the code first, and thought that we're keeping an entry per document in the index, whether it's scored or not.\n\nThe current code is good then.\n\nI'll review the new patch now.
