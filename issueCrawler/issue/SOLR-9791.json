    "description": "I seem to be running into a problem where restoring a backup to a given collection using the async feature reports that the backup has completed, but the collection is empty. All shards, and there are no errors in the logs. However, I still see in the logs:\n\n\norg.apache.solr.handler.RestoreCore; Copying file _xxx.xx to restore directory \n\n\n\nIt sounds to me like this would mean that restoration is not in fact complete.\n\nWould it be possible to have the async functionality more accurately report the restoration of a backup? Alternately, am I missing an API functionality I should be referring to?\n\nThanks!",
