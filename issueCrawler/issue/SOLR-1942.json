I think its a little bit confusing how the CodecProvider/CoreCodecProvider hierarchy works today, and a bit dangerous how we delegate over this class.\n\nFor example, if we add a new method to CodecProvider, we need to be sure we add the 'delegation' here every time or stuff will start acting strange.\n\nFor this reason, I wonder if CodecProvider should be an interface: the simple implementation we have in lucene is a hashmap, but Solr uses fieldType lookup. This would parallel how SimilarityProvider works.\n\nIf we want to do this, I think we should open a separate issue... in fact I'm not even sure it should block this issue since in my opinion its a shame you cannot manipulate codecs in Solr right now... but I just wanted to bring it up here.

I think if you want to have a CP that loads up codecs by classname like this, it should be done in a CodecProviderFactory (you know parsing arguments however it wants).\n\tI think its confusing how the SchemaCodecProvider answers to codec requests in 3 ways, 1. from the 'delegate' in SolrConfig, 2. from the schema, and 3. from the default codecProvider. I think if you try to use this, its easy to get yourself in a situation where solrconfig conflicts with the schema. I also don't think we need to bother with the 'defaultCP', in other words if you specify a custom codec provider, this is the only one that is used.\n\n "
