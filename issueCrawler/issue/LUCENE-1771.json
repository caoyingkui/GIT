            "content": "I think the Changes entries could still use some polish.\n\nHere are the originals:\n\n 3. LUCENE-1630: Deprecate Weight in favor of QueryWeight: added\n    matching methods to Searcher to take QueryWeight and deprecated\n    those taking Weight.  If you have a Weight implementation, you can\n    turn it into a QueryWeight with QueryWeightWrapper (will be\n    removed in 3.0). All of the Weight-based methods were implemented\n    by calling the QueryWeight variants by wrapping the given Weight.\n    Going forward Searchable will be kept for convenience only and may\n    be changed between minor releases without any deprecation\n    process. It is not recommended to implement it, but rather extend\n    Searcher.  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)\n\n24. LUCENE-1630: Deprecate Weight in favor of QueryWeight, which adds\n    a scorer(IndexReader, boolean /* scoreDocsInOrder /, boolean /\n    topScorer */) method instead of scorer(IndexReader) (now\n    deprecated). The new method is used by IndexSearcher to mate\n    between Collector and Scorer orderness of doc IDs. Some Scorers\n    (like BooleanScorer) are much more efficient if out-of-order\n    documents scoring is allowed by a Collector.  Collector must now\n    implement acceptsDocsOutOfOrder. If you write a Collector which\n    does not care about doc ID orderness, it is recommended that you\n    return true.  QueryWeight has the scoresDocsOutOfOrder method,\n    which by default returns false.  If you create a QueryWeight which\n    will score documents out of order if that's requested, you should\n    override that method to return true.  Also deprecated\n    BooleanQuery's setAllowDocsOutOfOrder and getAllowDocsOutOfOrder\n    as they are not needed anymore. BooleanQuery will now score docs\n    out of order when used with a Collector that can accept docs out\n    of order. (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)\n\nAnd I've changed to:\n\n 3. LUCENE-1630, LUCENE-1771: Weight, previously an interface, is now an abstract \n    class. Some of the method signatures have changed, but it should be fairly\n    easy to see what adjustments must be made to existing code to sync up\n    with the new API. You can find more detail in the API Changes section.\n\n    Going forward Searchable will be kept for convenience only and may\n    be changed between minor releases without any deprecation\n    process. It is not recommended that you implement it, but rather extend\n    Searcher.  (Shai Erera, Chris Hostetter, Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)\n\n24. LUCENE-1630, LUCENE-1771: Weight is now an abstract class, andd adds\n    a scorer(IndexReader, boolean /* scoreDocsInOrder /, boolean /\n    topScorer */) method instead of scorer(IndexReader). The new method \n    is used by IndexSearcher to mate Collector and Scorer orderness \n    of doc IDs. Some Scorers (like BooleanScorer) are much more efficient \n    if out-of-order documents scoring is allowed by a Collector.  Collector \n    must now implement acceptsDocsOutOfOrder. If you write a Collector \n    which does not care about doc ID orderness, it is recommended that you\n    return true.  Weight has a scoresDocsOutOfOrder method, which by default \n    returns false.  If you create a Weight which will score documents out of\n    order if requested, you should override that method to return true. \n    BooleanQuery's setAllowDocsOutOfOrder and getAllowDocsOutOfOrder have \n    been deprecated as they are not needed anymore. BooleanQuery will now \n    score docs out of order when used with a Collector that can accept docs \n    out of order. Finally, Weight#explain now also takes a Searcher.\n    (Shai Erera, Chris Hostetter, Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)\n\nSo one thing I don't like is  The new method is used by IndexSearcher to mate Collector and Scorer orderness of doc IDs.  I know what it means, but its a bit vague and awkward. I'm not sure how to best rewrite it though.\n\nAlso, while the entry talks a lot about the orderedIds param, it doesn't really mention the topScorer param. I'm still not 100% clear on it after looking at the javadocs either (without looking at the code). I don't think top scorer can be defined using primarily the term top scorer - it might as well be the omega scorer unless you can point me to the Lucene dictionary where I can look it up:\n\n\n  * @param topScorer\n   *          specifies whether the returned {@link Scorer} will be used as a\n   *          top scorer or as in iterator. I.e., if true,\n   *          {@link Scorer#score(Collector)} will be called; if false,\n   *          {@link Scorer#nextDoc()} and/or {@link Scorer#advance(int)} will\n   *          be called.\n\n\n\nSo I still want to beef up these changes a bit, and I think the javadoc needs to be a bit more clear - as we don't provide a convenience method that chooses defaults for those params, it should be very easy to quickly figure out whats best to pass. Right now, its just a little less than clear without some code browsing. ",
