    "description": "The issue I have is with the highlighting component during block joins where I am searching on the parent document but returning the children.\n\nAs I am returning the children the snippets also apply to the children, but I am actually searching in the parent.  (search query example: \n{!child of=type:parent}\nq ) \n\nSo could it be possible to return snippets for the parent on which I am actually searching?",
