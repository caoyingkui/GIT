Some UNIX boxes are configured to purge old files from /tmp/ in order not tu run out of free disk space in /tmp partition.  Perhaps this is what happened here.\n\nThe fix is to configure Jetty to expand webapps to a dir that does not get purged.  Of course,  I cannot remember the property name for that. "
