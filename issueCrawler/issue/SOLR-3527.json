            "content": "I was investigating this issue and found that DistribUpdateProcessor distributes the commit commands using the SolrCommandDistributor.distribCommit(...). The method creates Actions to be distributed to other nodes like:\n\n\nvoid addCommit(UpdateRequestExt ureq, CommitUpdateCommand cmd) {\n    if (cmd == null) return;\n    ureq.setAction(cmd.optimize ? AbstractUpdateRequest.ACTION.OPTIMIZE\n        : AbstractUpdateRequest.ACTION.COMMIT, false, cmd.waitSearcher);\n  }\n\n\n\nIn that method, the action is not considering the \"maxOptimizeSegments\" parameter, that's why it's not being distributed to other nodes. However, a bigger problem may be that this method is omitting other parameters too, like \"softCommit\" and \"epungeDeletes\", which means that an explicit soft commit issued like:\n\n\nhttp://host:port/solr/update?commit=true&softCommit=true\n\n\n\ncan be distributed as a hard commit to the nodes. I'm not sure about this because I haven't write any test case yet, but it's definitely something to test.\n\n "
