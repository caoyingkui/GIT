    "description": "Wanted to have the ability to ignore case in the stop filter.  In some cases, I\ndon't want to have to lower case before passing through the stop filter, b/c I\nmay need case preserved for other analysis further down the stream, yet I don't\nneed the stopwords and I don't want to have to apply stopword filters twice.",
