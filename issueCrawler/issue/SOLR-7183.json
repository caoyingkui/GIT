    "description": "SaslZkACLProviderTest has this blacklist of locales...\n\n  // These Locales don't generate dates that are compatibile with Hadoop MiniKdc.\n  protected final static List<String> brokenLocales =\n    Arrays.asList(\n      \"th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai\",\n      \"ja_JP_JP_#u-ca-japanese\",\n      \"hi_IN\");\n\n\n\n..but this list is incomplete \u2013 notably because it only focuses on one specific Thai variant, and then does a string Locale.toString() comparison.  so at a minimum -Dtests.locale=th_TH also fails - i suspect there are other variants that will fail as well....\n\n\n\tif there is a bug in \"Hadoop MiniKdc\" then that bug should be filed in jira, and there should be Solr jira that refers to it \u2013 the Solr jira URL needs to be included her in the test case so developers in the future can understand the context and have some idea of if/when the third-party lib bug is fixed\n\tif we need to work around some Locales because of this bug, then Locale comparisons need be based on whatever aspects of the Locale are actually problematic\n\n\n\nsee for example SOLR-6387 & this commit: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/branches/branch_4x/solr/contrib/morphlines-core/src/test/org/apache/solr/morphlines/solr/AbstractSolrMorphlineZkTestBase.java?r1=1618676&r2=1618675&pathrev=1618676\n\nOr SOLR-6991 + TIKA-1526 & this commit: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/branches/lucene_solr_5_0/solr/contrib/extraction/src/test/org/apache/solr/handler/extraction/ExtractingRequestHandlerTest.java?r1=1653708&r2=1653707&pathrev=1653708",
