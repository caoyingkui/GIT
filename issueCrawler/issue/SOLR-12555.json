    "description": "I recently added some test code through SOLR-12427 which used the following test anti-pattern:\n\n\ntry {\n    actionExpectedToThrowException();\n    fail(\"I expected this to throw an exception, but it didn't\");\ncatch (Exception e) {\n    assertOnThrownException(e);\n}\n\n\n\nHoss (rightfully) objected that this should instead be written using the formulation below, which is clearer and more concise.\n\n\nSolrException e = expectThrows(() -> {...});\n\n\n\nWe should remove many of these older formulations where it makes sense.  Many of them were written before expectThrows was introduced, and having the old style assertions around makes it easier for them to continue creeping in.",

(I attached a file above with the number of tests per package, if that helps.)  I'll do the same when I'm able to start in on this myself (probably not till this weekend).  I really don't think these changes are particularly dangerous, but as flaky as Solr's tests are at the moment, I was thinking we could break this into smaller commits that I'll make with some time in between, so that it's easier to catch any test failures we might introduce.  We could aim to change around 30 tests in each commit.  (If you're up for doing more than that though, feel free.  I can always break things into chunks on my end before committing.) ",
