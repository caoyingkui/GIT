    "description": "The path used for the freedisk snitch value is hardcoded to / whereas it should be using Solr home. It's fairly common to use hardware for Solr with multiple physical disks on different mount points, with multiple Solr instances running on the box, each pointing its Solr home to a different disk. In this case, the value reported for the freedisk snitch value is wrong, because it's based on the root filesystem space.\n\nPatch changes this to use solr home from the CoreContainer.",
