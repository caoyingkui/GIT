Don't have the snapshot of the sampling handy, but it was spending a large amount of time constructing the FieldInfos, all spent in the adding to byNumber within the constructor - which is dropped in the case of the dense case, though it is used so the FieldInfos are sorted in the dense case too - one would need to do sort on another structure at minimum the way it looks right now, not 100% this would even be faster but hopefully!\n\n David Smiley exactly, this was a significant amount of time.
