    "description": "In LUCENE-2637, i disabled copyBytes optimization (so it just calls writeBytes), but i mentioned there,\nthat I think it would be good to try to beef up tests if we ever wanted to have an optimization like this.\n\nthe problem was that when there was an index corruption bug, it was very difficult to detect with our tests.\nSo I think for safety, we should do this, even though its redundant with our current impl, since we look\nfor this in writeBytes.",
