    "description": "previously this was 3 hashes (prefixes, words, suffixes) and it tried to split the words in various ways and do lookups. This was changed to FST, but the algorithm wasn't adjusted to use it properly (e.g. single pass, terminate when it reaches a \"dead end\").\n\nthis makes for slower indexing when using this stemmer...",

So its not much of a relative increase in speed (due to some properties of this dictionary), but still I think its worth it. And of course its much better compared to 71 docs/second in Lucene 4.7...
