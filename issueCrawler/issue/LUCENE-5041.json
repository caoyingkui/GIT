    "description": "The problem appears in version 4.3.0 and in revision 1490286.  I\nattached a two-line patch that fixes it.\n\nIn method \"CheckIndex.checkIndex(List<String>)\", the loop over\n\"onlySegments\" should not be executed when \"infoStream\" is \"null\".\nWhen \"infoStream\" is \"null\" the loop produces no results.  The patch\njust flips the order of the \"if\" and \"for\" statements.\n\nMethod \"collect\" in class \"MultiComparatorNonScoringCollector\" has a\nsimilar loop (the last loop in the method over \"comparators\"), and\nthis loop is not executed when \"queueFull\" is false, just like in the\nproposed patch.",
