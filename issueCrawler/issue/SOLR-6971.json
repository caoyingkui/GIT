            "content": "On the face of it it's very strange. Here's the code leading up to that assert from DistributedQueue.java[120]\n\n\n    List<String> childNames = zookeeper.getChildren(dir, null, true);\n    stats.setQueueLength(childNames.size());\n    for (String childName : childNames) {\n      if (childName != null) {\n        try {\n          byte[] data = zookeeper.getData(dir + \"/\" + childName, null, null, true);\n          if (data != null) {\n            ZkNodeProps message = ZkNodeProps.load(data); // nocommit, called by CollectionsHandler, 687. Trips assert in ByteUtils.\n\n\n\nThe assert itself from ByteUtils is this bit of code:\n\n      if (b < 0xc0) {\n        assert b < 0x80;\n        out[out_offset++] = (char)b;\n\n\n\nwhere b is marching through the buffer passed in that has just been read from ZK. So on the face of it, this looks like somehow the data read from ZK is bad since this is being tripped by data read from ZK, not data passed in.\n\nSeems like we need to dump the data in UTF8toUTF16, something like below. Is there precedent, i.e. some nifty buffer dumping already coded up somewhere I can use that would allow us to dump the UTF8 buffer in this case?\n\n\n      if (b < 0xc0) {\n        if (b < 0x80) {  dump lots of stuff here, current bytes decoded, the raw bytes, offset of offending character and all that }\n        assert b < 0x80;\n        out[out_offset++] = (char)b;\n\n\n\n\nI'm traveling through Monday and won't have a lot of time to pursue this before then.

I monitor the build fail messages sent to the dev list since I committed the patch and haven't seen any, is this happening to you locally?\n\nSo I did a gmail search to see if this has stopped and it seems something fixed it or worked around it around September 27.\n\nOn August 31st, Shalin Shekhar Mangar noticed it on the dev list and said:\n\nThat's a strange one. Looks like something other than a proper string was stored in the ZK node.\n\nIt happened all year before that.\n\nI don't know why it went away in September, but I have not seen it locally in a long time and I have nothing in email with that fail after Sept 27.
