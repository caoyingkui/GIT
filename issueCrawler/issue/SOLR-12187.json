    "description": "With the introduction of autoscaling framework, we have seen an increase in the number of issues related to the race condition between delete a replica and other stuff.\n\nCase 1: DeleteReplicaCmd failed to send UNLOAD request to a replica, therefore, forcefully remove its entry from clusterstate, but the replica still function normally and be able to become a leader -> SOLR-12176\nCase 2:\n\n\tDeleteReplicaCmd enqueue a DELETECOREOP (without sending a request to replica because the node is not live)\n\tThe node start and the replica get loaded\n\tDELETECOREOP has not processed hence the replica still present in clusterstate --> pass checkStateInZk\n\tDELETECOREOP is executed, DeleteReplicaCmd finished\n\t\n\t\tresult 1: the replica start recovering, finish it and publish itself as ACTIVE --> state of the replica is ACTIVE\n\t\tresult 2: the replica throw an exception (probably: NPE)\n--> state of the replica is DOWN, not join leader election",
