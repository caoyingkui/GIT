            "content": "I just debugged the code and uncovered the problem.  There is a Map (called context) that is passed through to each value source to store intermediate state, and both the query and scale functions are passing the ValueSource for the query function in as the KEY to this Map (as opposed to using some composite key that makes sense in the current context).  Essentially, these lines are overwriting each other:\n\nInside ScaleFloatFunction: context.put(this.source, scaleInfo);  //this.source refers to the QueryValueSource, and the scaleInfo refers to a ScaleInfo object\nInside QueryValueSource: context.put(this, w); //this refers to the same QueryValueSource from above, and the w refers to a Weight object\n\nAs such, when the ScaleFloatFunction later goes to read the ScaleInfo from the context Map, it unexpectedly pulls the Weight object out instead and thus the invalid case exception occurs.  The NoOp multiplication works because it puts an \"different\" ValueSource between the query and the ScaleFloatFunction such that this.source (in ScaleFloatFunction) != this (in QueryValueSource). "

            "content": "Simple patch.  Just changing the ScaleFloatFunction function to use itself as the key instead of the ValueSource it is using internally (it's first parameter).  This seems consistent with how other ValueSources (such as the QueryValueSource) work, and it fixes the issue at hand. "
