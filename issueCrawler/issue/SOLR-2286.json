I came across a bit of Java code that may or may not help alleviate some of this work.\n\nhttp://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/RSS-RDF/Rome/com/sun/syndication/io/impl/DateParser.java.htm\n\nI think that this would be a great addition to those of us who ingest a lot of syndicated data and then want to query on it.\n\nThanks, \nAdam",

I am not even at the point where I build the project from within an IDE. If you could point me in the right direction I can certainly take a stab at it.\n\nThanks,\nAdam "
