    "description": "The current XMLWriter class is kind of a misnomer. It's not a generic XMLWriter by any means, and that's not its intention. Its intention is to write instances (as responses) of a particular XML schema that SOLR clients (written in Java, Python, pick-your-favorite-programming-language) that speak its XML protocol can understand. So, we should rename it to SolrXmlResponseWriter to indicate its unique XML speak.\n\nMorever, as part of the next issue I'm going to report (refactoring all ResponseWriters to be a bit more friendly), we should probably do away with the current XmlResponseWriter (which simply delegates to XmlWriter \u2013 eeep) and just stick with SolrXmlResponseWriter. Patch forthcoming.",
