    "description": "We can now index 128-bit quantities, but still, making Fields for these is a bit of work: you have to do some numericutils sign-extension/sign-flipping magic for BigInteger quantities, deal with ipv4-mapped ipv6 addresses, etc.\n\nWe can just provide some simple field types that also have static factory methods for exact match/ranges.\n\nThe BigIntegerPoint is N-dimensional, so acts just like any other primitive, except its bigger (e.g. long long).\n\nInetAddressPoint is 1-dimensional by nature: of course you can have multiple values per field, thats different. Since we prefix-compress values, we can just map IPv4 addresses to IPv6 space and it works for both types. This is consistent with what InetAddress does itself anyway.",
