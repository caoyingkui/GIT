    "description": "I experimented with group=true (Result Grouping) in a product/SKU ecommerce scenario.  Ideally the client could be ignorant of the fact that the results are grouped when processing a grouped response (assuming it only needs the group heads and doesn't care how many matched per group).  It wants to see only the group head document, and have start/rows paging over them, and numFound to be the number of groups.  group.main doesn't do any of these things.  Is group.main actually useful to anyone right now?  If it's not; maybe we could change it (using some sort of back-compat mechanism like luceneVersion).",
