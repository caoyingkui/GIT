    "description": "The problem appears in version 4.3.0 and in revision 1491451.  I\nattached a one-line patch (patch.diff) that fixes it.  This problem\nand the attached patch are similar to the previously fixed\nLUCENE-5040, LUCENE-5041, and LUCENE-5044, and their patches.\n\nIn method \"PolyFieldTest.testSchemaBasics\", the loop over \"dynFields\"\nshould break immediately after \"seen\" is set to \"true\".  All the\niterations after \"seen\" is set to \"true\" do not perform any useful\nwork, at best they just set \"seen\" again to \"true\".\n\nSimilar problems exist in \"MoreLikeThisHandler.handleRequestBody\",\n\"AbstractCurrencyFieldTest.testCurrencySchema\", and\n\"BasicDistributedZk2Test.addNewReplica\".  I attached patches\npatch2.diff, patch3.diff, and patch4.diff for these methods.  I also\nattached a patch (patchAll.diff) that aggregates all these changes in\none single patch.\n\nMethod \"loadDataConfig\" in class \"DataImporter\" has a similar loop\n(over \"config.getEntities()\"), and this loop breaks immediately after\n\"isDeltaImportSupported\" is set to \"true\", just like in the proposed\npatches.  Other methods (e.g., \"IndexSchema.registerCopyField\"\n\"OverseerCollectionProcessor.checkForAlias\", \"HttpSolrServer.request\")\nalso have similar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed\npatches.",
