    "description": "There are several places where commands used are incompatible with older UNIX versions, even though these capabilities are present.  There are ways to rewrite the shell scripts to be compatible with these older versions.\n\nThe first example is the use of pgrep.  Older machines will have grep, egrep and fgrep, but NOT pgrep. I've been doing UNIX for well over a decade and never heard of pgrep, although it is installed on my home server apparently. \n\nThere are also enhancements like the use of  'cp -l'.  This could be accomplished with the 'ln' command instead on older UNIX versions.  Since it's also used recursively in snapshooter, which 'ln' doesn't support, it makes the command more complex.",

            "content": "I agree with Ken.  The true issue I was pointing out was the issue of portability, with Solaris 8 being just a single use case.  So a particular command may be an issue on Solaris 8 or Solaris 10 or AIX or whatever.  \n\nThe CENTRAL question is do we provide the greatest portability, by a lowest common denominator bash script or use Perl script?  \n\nWhen I've built Perl in the past, it goes through an extensive check to see the capabilities of the underlying system.  Perl is probably the best bet for portability.  Perl is even available on Windows.\n\nOne thing is that with Perl scripts, users on Windows would expect the scripts to work there too.  Would the scripts all work on windows, including hard links? "
