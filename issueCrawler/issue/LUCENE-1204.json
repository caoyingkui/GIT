Unfortunately the test now fails.\n\nI hope it's a test problem, but the code is simple enough that it looks correct to me.\nI haven't tracked it down further... I figured I'd report it ASAP.  I also don't know if it's broken in 2.3.1 or not. ",

Attached\nnew version of the patch.\n\nYonik does that sound right?\n\nIf so I'll commit this change to the test (it's a good addition!). ",
