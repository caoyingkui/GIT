    "description": "I hit several issues with ToParentBlockJoinQuery/Collector:\n\n\n\tIf a given Query sometimes has no child matches then we could hit\n    AIOOBE, but should just get 0 children for that parent\n\n\n\n\n\tTPBJC.getTopGroups incorrectly throws IllegalArgumentException\n    when the child query happens to have no matches\n\n\n\n\n\tWe have checks that user didn't accidentally pass a child query\n    that matches parent docs ... they are only assertions today but I\n    think they should be real checks since it's easy to screw up",
