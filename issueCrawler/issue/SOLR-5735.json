Not sure yet ... we opened on an index that was screwed up due to some replication fail?\n\nWe could catch everything except out of memory exceptions and if any of this peer sync part fails, try replication? But I still don't know for sure why the above happens. In the past it may have been hidden by the fact that we caught assertions and so we would have retried rather than bailing out of the recovery thread. "
