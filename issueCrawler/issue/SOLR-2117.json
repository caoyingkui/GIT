    "description": "SOLR-1435 forces all slaves to replicate at the same time (assuming system clocks are the same). Sometimes this is undesirable. For example, garbage collection and/or warmup can cause search slowdown immediately after an update. The goal is to allow the polling interval to be the same for each slave, but offset by some constant.",
