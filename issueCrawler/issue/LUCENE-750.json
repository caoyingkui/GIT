The Descriptor does not get cloned, so we eliminate the extra finalizer per IndexInput clone.\n\tDescriptor is now the class that keeps track of if it has been closed or not.\n\tmade Descriptor static... it didn't need to be a normal inner class.\n\n ",

Because, all\nuses of FSIndexOutput are \"transient\" (open, write stuff now, close).\n\nFor FSIndexInput ... assuming we are also quite certain that we close\nall IndexInputs we had opened for transient purposes (eg while merging\nsegments, reading fields/norms, etc.) then the only thing finalize()\nbuys for us is protection from user failing to close an IndexReader,\ndue either to a bug in their code or I guess handling Exception cases,\nright?\n\nHonestly it's even tempting to not keep this finalize (due risk of\ndegraded GC perf, JVM bugs, etc.)  Though, hmmm, I guess removing this\nfinalize could be seen as a regression if indeed people are relying on\nGC to close their readers.  So I guess we should keep this one (like\nyou have). ",
