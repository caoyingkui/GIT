    "description": "The UnifiedHighlighter's DefaultPassageFormatter (mostly unchanged from the old PostingsHighlighter) will format overlapping matches by closing a tag and immediately opening a tag. \u00a0I think this is a bit ugly structurally and it ought to continue the tag is if the matches were merged. \u00a0This is extremely rare in practice\u00a0today since a match is always a word, and thus we'd only see this behavior\u00a0if multiple words at the same position of different offsets\u00a0are highlighted. \u00a0The advent of matches representing phrases will increase the probability of this, and indeed was discovered while working on LUCENE-8286. \u00a0Additionally, and related, OffsetsEnums should internally be ordered by the end offset if the start offset is the same.",
