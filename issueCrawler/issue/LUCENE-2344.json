    "description": "We discovered that the current merge function in PostingsConsumer is not calling the #finishDoc method. This does not have consequences for the standard codec (since the lastPosition is set to 0 in #startDoc, and its #finishDoc method is empty), but for the SepCodec, this results in position file corruption (the lastPosition is set to 0 in #finishDoc for the SepCodec).",
