    "description": "I configured SSL and BasicAuthentication with Rule-Based-Authorization.\nI noticed that since the latest changes from 6.0.1 to 6.1.0 I cannot pass the Basic Authentication Credentials to the Solr Start Script anymore. For the previous release I did this via the bin/solr.in.sh shellscript.\n\nWhat has happened with the SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_CONFIGURER and SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_OPTS parameters? Are they still in use or is there a new way to pass basic auth credentials on the command-line?",
