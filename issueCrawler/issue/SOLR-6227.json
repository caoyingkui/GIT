Just means there was a fail when you wouldn't expect it - we expect 0 to fail because we don't kill leaders - seems one can occasionally fail with:  org.apache.http.NoHttpResponseException: The target server failed to respond. It's not necessarily illegal behavior, it just shouldn't really happen.\n\nAnyway, a much less concerning issue. As far as the inconsistency, which is totally illegal, like your report, I no longer see in my local jenkins jobs. Fantastic. Always a scary fail. "
