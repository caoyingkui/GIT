    "description": "It can be easily observed when backup size is big (I tested it with 1GB backup).\nI encountered it on 6.4 but quick look at the code shows that 7.x is affected as well.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1) start solr, create core and index some data \n2) call /replication?command=backup\n3) call (multiple times) /replication?command=details\nFor some time \"backup\" will be missing in the response (because backup is in progress) then it will report \"success\" and other properties\n4) call /replication?command=backup again\n5) call (multiple times) replication?command=details \nFor some time old \"backup\" status will be returned: with status \"success\" (misleading!) -  there is no indication that backup is in progress.\n\nThe only way to detect if backup is really done (workaround):\n 1) store value of  startTime/snapshotCompletedAt\n 2) call /replication?command=backup\n 3) call /replication?command=details and check if startTime/snapshotCompletedAt is different\n\nRoot cause of the problem: snapShootDetails field of org.apache.solr.handler.ReplicationHandler is being returned by getReplicationDetails.\nThis fields is updated by org.apache.solr.handler.SnapShooter::createSnapAssync when the backup is done. If \"details\" is called after backup start but before it ends - outdated value will be returned.\n\nPossible fix:\nsnapShootDetails  should be updated before calling SnapShooter::createSnapAssync:\n1) quick and dirty: set snapShootDetails  to null (quite ugly it will be consistent with first call to \"backup\" command)\n2) Extend \"backup\" (add properties) - store previous backup (or last successful) status as field in \"backup\" and update other fields before createSnapAssync is called (update startTime, set status to \"In Progress\", remove snapshotCompletedAt, snapshotName, fileCount)",
