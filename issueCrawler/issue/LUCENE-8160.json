    "description": "Frustratingly we still don't have a Query visitor API in Lucene ( LUCENE-3041 ) so I took a basic stab at it within the confines of the UnifiedHighlighter. This patch is more of a simple pragmatic solution for the UH than it is for the wholistic goals of LUCENE-3041 (that would likely change Query itself). Today the UH has one massive if-else Query branch \u2013 MultiTermHighlighting, plus it re-uses WeightedSpanTermExtractor (WSTE) from the original Highlighter in a rather hacky way. In this patch I introduce QueryVisitor.java to the UH that has the massive instanceof branches in it with many places to subclass. I modified MultiTermHighlighting to use it and I modified PhraseHelper as well to wean itself off of WSTE. Interestingly PhraseHelper needed to instantiate this a second time since it needed to separately look to see if the SpanQuery contained a SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper. QueryVisitor and some usage sites contain numerous TODOs to elicit some conversation in a code review about the approach.\n\nTo fully wean the UH off of WSTE, I also added a SpanQueryConverter for converting PhraseQuery and MultiPhraseQuery. Again I also conservatively added it to the highlighter module even though it's of a general nature.\n\nAlthough the patch \"works\",\u00a0it needs cleanup and feedback.\n\nCC Alan Woodward Jim Ferenczi",
