    "description": "Per SOLR-5565, ZooKeeper session timeout should have been raised to 30s. This was changed in the solr.xml example but it was not changed in the solr script, which has this:\n\n\nif [ -z \"$ZK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT\" ]; then\n    ZK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=\"15000\"\n  fi\n\n\n\nAnd for solr.cmd:\n\n\n IF \"%ZK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT%\"==\"\" set \"ZK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=15000\"\n\n\n\nSo regardless of what is in solr.xml, if ZK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT is not set, it will be overridden to 15,000. I'd think this should be raised to 30,000 or removed entirely to fall back on the solr.xml's behavior.  Mark Miller is this correct?",
