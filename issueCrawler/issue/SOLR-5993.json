    "description": "If the clusterState and ZK disagree about the shard leader for awhile, a warning is printed to the log here:\n\n         String warnMsg = String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, \"Still seeing conflicting information about the leader \"\n              + \"of shard %s for collection %s after %d seconds; our state says %s, but ZooKeeper says %s\",\n              cloudDesc.getShardId(), collection, tries, clusterStateLeaderUrl, leaderUrl);\n\n\n\nThe issue is that the clusterStateLeaderUrl and leaderUrl are updated but not checked before the warning, so a warning can be printed to the log saying something like:\nour state says localhost:9893_solr but ZooKeeper says localhost:9893_solr\n\nwhich is confusing because there is no conflict.",
