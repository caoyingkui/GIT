    "description": "When I ran performance tests for different UUID fields for http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2014/05/choosing-fast-unique-identifier-uuid.html I found that full binary term, i.e. base / radix 256 using all 256 values of each byte, was typically faster than the \"default\" base 16/36/etc. encoding for UUIDs.\n\nBut in Lucene today it's a hassle to index a binary term (I had to go poach BinaryTokenStream from tests).\n\nI think we should make this easier so apps are encouraged to use it for their ID-like fields.\n\nMaybe we add an indexable option to BinaryField?",
