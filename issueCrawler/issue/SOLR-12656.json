Specifically, the chaos monkey test method and split by unique key methods rely on some methods in AbstractFullDistribZkTestBase so porting them over to SolrCloudTestCase is not straightforward. I'm going to change ShardSplitTest to extend AbstractFullDistribZkTestBase instead of BasicDistributedZkTest and tackle the port when I have more time to spend on this. ",
