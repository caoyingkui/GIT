    "description": "DirectoryTaxonomyWriter has a protected indexWriter member. As far as I can tell, for two reasons:\n\n\n\tprotected openIndexWriter method which lets you open your own IW (e.g. with a custom IndexWriterConfig).\n\tprotected closeIndexWriter which is a hook for letting you close the IW you opened in the previous one.\n\n\n\nThe fixes are trivial IMO:\n\n\tModify the method to return IW, and have the calling code set DTW's indexWriter member\n\tEliminate closeIW. DTW already has a protected closeResources() which lets you clean other resources you've allocated, so I think that's enough.\n\n\n\nI'll post a patch shortly.",
