    "description": "Robert suggested this idea: if there are few unique sets of values, we could build a lookup table and then map each doc to an ord in this table, just like we already do for table compression for numerics.\n\nI think this is especially compelling given that SortedSet/SortedNumeric are our two only doc values types that use O(maxDoc) memory because of the offsets map. When this new strategy is used, memory usage could be bounded to a constant.",

            "content": "Here is a patch: it uses table encoding for SortedSet/SortedNumeric if the sum of the sizes of all unique sets is 256 or less. If my math is correct, this means it will always be used if there are 6 unique values or less (given that the sum of the sizes of all possible subsets would be 192), and might be used if the number of unique values is between 7 and 256.
