    "description": "Spinoff from SOLR-8207. When adding more cluster-wide functionality to the Admin UI, it feels better to name the \"Cloud\" UI tab as \"Cluster\".\n\nIn addition to renaming the \"Cloud\" tab, we should also change the URL part from ~cloud to ~cluster, update reference guide page names, screenshots and references etc.\n\nI propose this change is not introduced in 7.x due to the impact, so tagged it as fix-version 8.0.",
