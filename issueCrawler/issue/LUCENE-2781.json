If anybody knows how to fix them fast - please do this. If not, I'll get back at them in a couple of days. Or maybe we can just drop them?\n\tVersion.LUCENE_2x should be dropped, Version.LUCENE_3x - marked as deprecated\n\n ",

At your leisure, sometime during the entire 3.0-3.9 or whatever, you migrate to Version.LUCENE_30 and the deprecation goes away.\n\tWhen you move to Lucene 4.0, the Version.LUCENE_24 stuff etc stuff is gone, but its no surprise, because you are guided via deprecations. 4.0 doesnt support 2.x indexes anyway.\n\n\n\nSo I'm strongly +1 to committing this 2.3MB patch that removes 100,000 lines of crap from trunk.
