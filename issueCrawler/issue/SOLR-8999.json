    "description": "In Solr tests, we always start with a completely pristine tmp directories for each test to use, and all of our existing MiniSolrCloudClusters expect that and MiniSolrCloudCluster creates everything it needs.\n\nBut for Solr clients, that want to write tests using MiniSolrCloudCluster to test their own code, MiniSolrCloudCluster can currently fail in confusing ways if they re-use the \"baseDir\" in multiple tests runs.\n\nAt a minimum, if MiniSolrCloudCluster is going to expect baseDir to always be empty on construction, then we should document this and assert it in the constructor.\n\nBut it seems to me that it might also be useful if it were  possible (even if not the default behavior) to spin up a MiniSolrCloudCluster pointing at an existing baseDir that already had zk server data and existing solr instanceDirs and verify that everything could be started up after a previous total shutdown.",
