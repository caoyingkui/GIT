    "description": "While extending the index writer, I discovered that its newestSegment method does not check to see if there are any segments before accessing the segment infos vector. Specifically, if you call the IndexWriter#newestSegment method on a brand-new index which is essentially empty, then it throws an java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception.\n\nThe proposed fix is to return null if no segments exist, as shown below:\n\n\u2014 lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.java\t(revision 930788)\n+++ lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.java\t(working copy)\n@@ -4587,7 +4587,7 @@\n\n   // utility routines for tests\n   SegmentInfo newestSegment() \n{\n-    return segmentInfos.info(segmentInfos.size()-1);\n+    return segmentInfos.size() > 0 ? segmentInfos.info(segmentInfos.size()-1) : null;\n   }",
