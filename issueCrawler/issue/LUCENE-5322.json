Then recursive non-public -dist-maven doesn't have to worry about these things being done.\n\nThis patch also fixes the problem introduced by LUCENE-5217 with resolve not being called before get-maven-poms and filter-pom-templates.\n\nI'll commit this to trunk shortly, then to branch_4x after LUCENE-5217 has been committed to branch_4x, in a few days.
