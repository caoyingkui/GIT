AfterClass is invoked inside the class rule that detects failures so certain exceptions could happen in between, but individual tests should taint that suiteFailureMarker.\n\nYou will not be able to react to hanging threads \u2013 this is initiated and executed outside of the test classes, followed by interrupt on the test thread (which then may throw random crap at the fan). This is chicken-and-egg problem, I don't think it's quite solvable. You should scan for failures in the log, top-to-bottom... ",

I think you should still try to close any resources that may interfere with subsequent tests, just not report all failures? Otherwise you run the risk of leaving something that can fail or interact with tests executed later.\n\nI think the ideal solution would be for the test runner to detect a failure and (optionally) respin the JVM....
