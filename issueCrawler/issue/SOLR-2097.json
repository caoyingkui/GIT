    "description": "We just spent 15minutes looking very dumb at why our CREATE command wouldn't execute after an UNLOAD. This was simply because the CREATE command is the only one which has a core parameter that is actually called name. \n\nNow I understand that since it's creating a core, there is no core yet to be used and the name is given instead, but for the sake of consistency imo it'd be a good thing to add a \"core\" alias to \"name\". Alternatively it could be highlighted in red in the wiki if you think this is an unreasonable demand.",
