            "content": "+1, i'm the culprit here. the whole reason for the size estimation method, was that just calling RUE on segmentcorereaders or whatever in my tests was wayy too slow.\n\nIn general there might be more issues than Lucene3xFields. For older deprecated codecs, I \"cheated\" and used this method, instead of trying to properly implement it... because they were just for back compat. But I can see how an app would use the method, yet still have some old segments... ",
