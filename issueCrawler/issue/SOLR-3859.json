As a test, I took down the leader to watch how leader election works. In this case, a leader was selected, but it went into a state of \"recovery failed\". The odd thing is that everything still works. I can query that box directly and I can query the cluster and I observe correct behavior.",

            "content": "I think this is occurring when two nodes are killed simultaneously. This happened on ec2, so it's not that uncommon to take multiple servers down at once. My theory is that when a leader goes down, a new leader is chosen, but if the new leader has also gone down, then the remaining nodes cannot recover properly. Then, if the node that failed to recover is elected leader, it stays in that same \"recovery failed\" state.\n\n\n "
