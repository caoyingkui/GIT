            "content": "Thanks Shai.  Here's a patch that adds the tmatesoft snapshots repository to ivy-settings.xml, and updates extra-targets.xml to use svnkit 1.8.0-SNAPSHOT.\n\nI'm a bit wary of committing it, though, as I don't like adding dependencies on snapshots.  Maybe just keep this patch up for people who want to use svn 1.8 until tmatesoft officially release svnkit 1.8.0?  (I ended up working round the precommit problem by just using svn 1.7 for this project.  Or you could just be resigned to breaking the build occasionally  "

The latest Maven Central version of 1.7 is still behind the one on their own repo. But if its urgent, once 1.8 is released, we can of course add the official svnkit repo to our list of repositories (the release one). "
