            "content": "Thanks Marius.\n\nI'm attaching a modified patch:\n\n\n\tSpecifying an analyzer class on a field type is mutually exclusive of specification of char filters, a tokenizer, and filters - I modified FieldTypeXmlAdaptor.createAnalyzerElement() to throw exceptions for requests that improperly mix these, and added a test confirming that to TestBulkSchemaAPI.\n\tFieldType.getAnalyzerProperties() wasn't outputting luceneMatchVersion, so although field type addition/modification was properly accepting specification of luceneMatchVersion when an analyzer class was specified, serialization wasn't preserving the information.  I fixed it, and added a test that the round-tripping works to TestBulkSchemaAPI.\n\tYour patch moved some imports around in FieldTypeXmlAdaptor but didn't otherwise change them.  In general, don't reorder imports unless they're completely unordered or you change them significantly.  You may have to change a setting in your IDE to address this.  (I put them back in my patch.)\n\n\n\nI think it's ready to go - I'll commit shortly. ",
