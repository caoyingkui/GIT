    "description": "I've ported langid.py \u2013 a Python language identifier with some very nice properties (see the research paper by Marco Lui) and pretty good language identification quality.\n\nThe major benefit though is speed. Without subsampling (which google code's languagedetection does) the benchmark on europarl clocks at:\n\n--> langid-v3\n     20826/     21000 (99.1714%) in 0.75 sec. (28075 docs/sec.)\n--> languagedetect\n     20846/     21000 (99.2667%) in 4.24 sec. (4948 docs/sec.)\n\n\nSo nearly the same language detection quality and five times faster. If you limit the number of languages to detect it'll be faster still \u2013 see the benchmarking snippets.\n\nYet another nice  property is that it runs on UTF8 sequences natively. I've built-in a loop with the default Java's charset decoder but if you already have BytesRef you don't need to create strings at all.\n\nhttps://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/carrotsearch/langid-java/\n\nThe source code is at github:\nhttps://github.com/carrotsearch/langid-java",
