Stack traces all over the place and a non-functioning installation, can't query, can't get to localhost:8983:/solr, etc. At least that's what happened when I just tried it on trunk. Top-level error below. Or I screwed up again when I tested before committing this, that's been known to happen.\n\nSo the current comments do reflect \"reality\". Whether it should behave this way is a different question, I was a bit surprised by this behavior as well. Perhaps another JIRA about making version not required in non-cloud mode is in order?\n\nHmmm, or I need to disable update log..... Let me try that.\n\nAs for \"id\", as far as I know it's not required. Personally I'd like to make it required since, as you say, so much breaks if you don't have it. But that's another JIRA too.\n\n{msg=SolrCore 'collection1' is not available due to init failure: Unable to use updateLog: version field must exist in schema, using indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" and multiValued=\"false\" (version does not exist),trace=org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: SolrCore 'collection1' is not available due to init failure: Unable to use updateLog: version field must exist in schema, using indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" and multiValued=\"false\" (version does not exist)\n\tat org.apache.solr.core.CoreContainer.getCore(CoreContainer.java:785)\n "
