    "description": "If you are using the cursorMark (deep paging) feature, you shouldn't have to add the uniqueKey to the sort parameter.  If the user doesn't do it, the user obviously doesn't care about the uniqueKey order relative to whatever other sort parameters they may or may not have provided.  So if sort doesn't have it, then Solr should simply tack it on at the end instead of providing an error and potentially confusing the user.  This would be more user friendly.\n\nQuoting Hoss from SOLR-5463:\n\nThe reason the code currently throws an error was because i figured it was better to force the user to choose which tie breaker they wanted (asc vs desc) then to just magically pick one arbitrarily.\n\nIf folks think a magic default is a better i've got no serious objections \u2013 just open a new issue.",

            "content": "I don't think there's much to gain from forcing a user to specify a tiebreaker.\n\nA good reason why forcing the user to explicitly include the uniqueKey in the sort string to use cursor's occurred to me this morning while replying to a solr-user thread (\"Subject: How to migrate content of a collection to a new collection\"):\n\n\nIt forces the user to be aware that Solr will be sorting on the uniqueKey. It's not hidden from them, and they are given an opportunity to consider the resulting RAM impacts.\n\n\nSince the memory usage of the FieldCache is certainly non-trivial on really large collection, making user is explicitly aware that their uniqueKey needs to be in the sort puts them in the position to consider their memory needs and/or make an informed decision about enabling docValues on their uniqueKey field (something most people probably wouldn't ever need to do unless they normally have reasons to do range queries or sort on their uniqueKey field)\n\nAs things stand right now, if someone switches their usage from sort=foo+asc&start=0&rows=100 to sort=foo+asc&start=0&rows=100*cursorMark=* they get a clear error that they need to consider how they want their uniqueKey field to be included in the sort.  If we change the code to silently rewrite their sort param to be sort=foo+asc,+id+asc internally w/o any obvious feedback to them, that could chew up a lot of ram on them unexpectedly, and they could see really weird performance changes and/or OOM and think it's some inherent behavior/problem with using cursors.\n\n\nSo i think i take back my \"i've got no serious objections\" comment, and instead vote \"-1\" to the idea.\n\nI'd rather users get an error the first time they try and have to manually change things, then be frustrated/confused by why cursors (seemingly) degrade their overall system performance so much.

I tend to think there's value in having the ID be a docValues field (which alays your concern), and especially if Solr was better about consulting docValues for it if this was so, like if you only want the unique key such as a shard over-request for matching document IDs.
