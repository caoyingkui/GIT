Lets make this SOLR-6796 about making distrib.singlePass work in every case. Believe the ugly patch will work in every case, but the \"less ugly\" patch will not. It will not work for e.g. \"val:sum(3,4)\". I will provide a \"less ugly\" patch very soon that will work in every case. ",

That is, you can turn on distrib.singlePass whenever you like, and have a response similar to a non-distributed request to a single core/shard containing the same data.\nWe have a version of Solr based on 4.4.0, with a lot of our own changes, and with SOLR-5768, SOLR-1880 and parts of SOLR-5399 merged. With this fix, then entire 4.4.0 test-suite is green, when we make all queries issued across the test-suite run with distrib.singlePass=true.\nAt least it fixes the particular problem that this SOLR-6796 is about.
