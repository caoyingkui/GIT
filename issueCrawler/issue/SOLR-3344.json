            "content": "Benson, where are you seeing these failures?  Why hasn't Jenkins unearthed them?\n\nWhy should Solr test-framework declare these dependencies at all?  That is, why can't modules with Jetty test dependencies simply declare the dependency there (with scope=test)?  This is already the case for the following Solr modules: solr-core, clustering, and dataimporthandler.\n\nIf it does turn out that Solr test-framework is the right place for these dependencies, it doesn't require Jetty to compile, so at a minimum, I would argue that the default compile scope you've used is inappropriate.  Maybe scope=runtime? "

            "content": "Here's how this plays out.\n\nIn my very own project, not in the lucene tree anywhere, I wrote a test class that uses the base class for distributed tests. So I put the test-framework in as a <scope>test</scope> dependency.\n\nIt compiles fine, but gets NoClassDefFound for Jetty when I run it. Why? Well, jetty is listed as an optional dependency of solr-core. So it is not transitive.\n\nI think that it's reasonable for the test framework jar to list it as a required dependency, since tests in there depend on it. However, there is an alternative (other than nothing): list it again as an optional dependency in test-framework, just to give people a hint, and/or change the javadoc for the BaseDistributedTestCase to note this requirement. \n "

But the Solr test-framework is a test-only module, and requiring test dependencies that won't be used by all consumers should not cause any undue hardship.\n\nSo I've changed my mind.  I'll put up a superset of your patch, Benson, that removes the dataimporthandler and clustering POMs' jetty dependencies.  I'll leave solr-core's optional dependency as-is. "
