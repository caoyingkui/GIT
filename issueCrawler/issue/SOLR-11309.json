We could split this out into two pages - one for the read and one for writes. \n\nAlso we could split it out from the \"How SolrCloud works\" top level nav to \"SolrCloud resiliency\"  nav which could in the future host a dedicated page on recoveries as well",

            "content": "Looks good, Varun, thanks.\n\nA few notes:\n\n\n\tThe current read-and-write-side-fault-tolerance.adoc page was left empty instead of deleted - that will for sure fail the build, which it did for me after applying your patch.\n\tYou updated how-solrcloud-works.adoc to remove the old read-and-write-side-fault-tolerance.adoc in the list of files under the :page-children: frontmatter, but haven't yet added any of the new pages as children of solrcloud.adoc. That leaves nav missing these pages since they have no place in the hierarchy (even though I see they are linked from solrcloud.adoc, you need to put them in the :page-children: frontmatter since that's what populates the left nav).\n\tI feel like we're mixing information about how SolrCloud works with a section called \"How SolrCloud Works\"  and now a new section that's now titled \"SolrCloud Resilience\" - my thought would be to make your two new pages as direct children of how-solrcloud-works.adoc. But, I know part of the goal is to surface this information more directly, and the whole thing needs a lot of re-org, so I'm willing to go ahead with this structure until I can get a chance to re-org it later (hopefully sooner than later, but later than now).\n\n\n\nIf you fix the first 2 issues in this list, I think you'd be OK to go ahead and commit it.
