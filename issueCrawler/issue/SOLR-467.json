            "content": "The other alternative to creating a new SolrServer for talking to different cores or servers is to treat it more like HttpClient... the URL could be specified in the request itself (and could default to the URL of the SolrServer if unset).  Not sure if it's worth the complexity though since SolrServer instances should be very lightweight now.  I'm considering simply creating one per request to be sent in distributed search... it gets rid of any caching complexity. "
