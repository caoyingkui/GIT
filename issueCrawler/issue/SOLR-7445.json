    "description": "It appears that in previous versions, literal.<fieldname> was used as a default value, and a parsed value overrode it. I understand why one might want to be able to override tika-parsed values, but I believe there are equally valid use cases for providing default values. Defaults could be provided with a default.<fieldname> parameter.\n\nFor example, in office documents and pdfs, a modified field is provided. However, this is not included in all such files. It would be useful to be able to provide the modified date from the file system to be used only in cases where the date is not in the metadata of the file.",
