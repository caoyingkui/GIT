    "description": "The Prometheus metrics exporter in contrib does not support exposing complex metrics types: histograms and summaries. In particular request times metrics in Solr provide quantile values, which could be exposed as a Prometheus summary.\n\nThese complex types are represented in the Prometheus wire format as multiple samples with different, related names, which should be produced in a particular order under a common header as described in https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/\n\nThe current Solr Prometheus exporter is able to produce any required sample lines, but not to group them as specified.\n\nThis is only a minor issue for now, as Prometheus currently seems to ignore these constraints (and metrics types in general) itself, but this may change in the future (as stated eg. in https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/)",
