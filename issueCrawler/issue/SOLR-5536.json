    "description": "It would be useful for the CollapsingQParserPlugin to support ValueSource collapse criteria.\n\nProposed syntax:\n\n\nfq={!collapse field=collapse_field max=value_source}\n\n\n\nThis ticket will also introduce a function query called \"cscore\",  which will return the score of the current document being collapsed. This will allow score to be incorporated into collapse criteria functions.\n\nA simple example of the cscore usage:\n\n\nfq={!collapse field=collapse_field max=sum(cscore(), field(x))}",

So the patch here likely built upon changes committed on other tickets. So it's best to look at the commits that were done in svn for the CollapsingQParserPlugin and merge them in order into your branch.\n\nJoel "
