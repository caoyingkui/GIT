This will allow us to simulate user scenario of traversing 10 docs at a time.\n\nAdded new FileBasedQueryMaker which allows for the specification of a file or resource containing a list of queries that can be parsed by the QP, assuming one per line.

Or, if you prefer to commit yours first, I'll reintegrate mine later. The changes are supposed to allow you now to easily add new report tasks. \n\nI also modified the micro-standard.alg to use the new traverse params.\n(I didn't try the new file based query makers.)\n\nAttached file (benchmark-more-updates.patch) contains the changes from benchmark-updates.patch.
