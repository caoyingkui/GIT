    "description": "I recently needed to deploy payloads for my search system and ran into a small wall: there was no query parser available for use with Payloads.  I through this one together, extending out of the new modular QueryParser structure.\n\nAttached is the class file.  I didn't know what package this would belong in (whether with the query parser or with the rest of the payload functionality in contrib/analyzers), so it's in the default package for now.\n\nI know this is a little, simple thing, but it seemed like something that should probably be included.",
