If a request changes in the future, the test will break and it will remind us to check documentation etc.\n\nAlso, I moved ClusterStatus to extend CollectionAdminRequest directly, at the expense of adding setter/getter for collection and shard names, as these are optional parameters for this request, yet CollectionShardAdminRequest always adds them. Because they are null (if unset), ModifiableSolrParams eventually does not set them, but I consider this magic and not desired behavior. ",
