    "description": "I found that NGramTokenFilter-ed token stream could be optimized in query.\n\nA standard 1,2 NGramTokenFilter will generate a token stream from \"abcde\" as follows:\na ab b bc c cd d de e\n\nWhen we index \"abcde\", we'll use all of the tokens.\n\nBut when we query, we only need:\nab cd de",

            "content": "Let me see if I understand this.  The reason only ab bc de are needed is because we only need single-sized n-grams in the query, even if the index-time n-grams had a range of sizes (1 and 2 in your example).\n\nI think that makes sense, as long as the positions are right, so that even if we put ab cd de in a phrase query (e.g. \"ab bc de\") that matches \"a ab b bc c cd d de e\".  Is that the case?\n\nOf course, because this issue contains a patch that includes changes for various other n-gram issues, I can't just commit this and we have to wait until we resolve other n-gram issues.
