This also removes IOExceptions from Tokenizer.setReader()\n\nThe only place that was actually throwing an IOException inside setReader was AbstractSpatialPrefixTreeFieldType, which I've changed to wrap as a RuntimeException.  It's apparently only used for the Solr analysis UI, so I think this should be fine, but it would be good if David Smiley could double-check that. "
