    "description": "Currently there is an (expert) API in scorer to allow you to take a scorer, and visit its children etc (e.g. booleanquery).\n\nI think we should improve this, so its general to all queries.\n\nThe current issues are:\n\n\tthe current api is hardcoded for booleanquery's Occurs, but we should support other types of children (e.g. disjunctionmax)\n\tit can be difficult to use the API, because of the amount of generics and the visitor callback API.\n\tthe current API enforces a DFS traversal when you might prefer BFS instead.",
