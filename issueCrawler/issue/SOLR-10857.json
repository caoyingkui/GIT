            "content": "Final patch, committing momentarily. Will commit to 6.6 branch for re-spin if we do that.\n\nThis affected all core unloading, not just stand-alone.\n\nIf you look at the patch you'll notice a kind of scary bit where I took out the if test when I moved the removeCoreDescriptor, see below. This does just what the old code did since the core descriptor was removed anyway even when deleteInstanceDir==false in 6.0+ at least.\n\n\n    if (deleteInstanceDir) { // we aren't going to reload this if we delete the instance dir.\n      solrCores.removeCoreDescriptor(cd);\n    }\n\n\n\nThis was another consequence of having copies of the CoreDescriptor hanging around in several places.\n\nI thought about removing the CoreDescriptor from SolrCore in SOLR-10007 and making the internal lists of CoreDescriptors in SolrCores and the transient plugin be the one true source of CoreDescriptors, but decided against it at the time due to how intrusive that patch was already, leaving that discussion for another day/JIRA.
