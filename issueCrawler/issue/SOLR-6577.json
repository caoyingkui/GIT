    "description": "Just realized a...significant problem with the \"arbitrary property\" bit (SOLR-6512). The way I wrote it I can delete any property at all, things like\ncore\nnode_name\netc.\n\nAnd when you do delete some of these, interesting things happen, like the cluster becomes unusable. Oops.\n\nI think the right thing to do here is to automatically add a \"property\" prefix to all of the arbitrary properties that a user tries to add or delete.\n\nI'll have a patch up tomorrow for this I hope.",
