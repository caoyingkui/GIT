The current commit seems to leave the checkout unclean after running tests; my response to the failure mail:\n\n\nit looks like Dawid's commit placed these .tests.totals files in the wrong directory. Should be inside build! Maybe some property is incorrectly initialized.\n\nIn addition I will add  another comment to the corresponding issue, because of some dependency of the commit to javascript, that\u2019s not fully guaranteed to be available in every JVM (e.g., on FreeBSD we don't have it).\n\nThe second thing is a problem on some platforms. We discussed about that already in the past (you know I was fighting pro Javascript), but other convinced me: Javascript is not guaranteed to be a available on every JDK (the JDK only defines the abstract script interface and mandates that some example script engine is avilable, but not which one). So I changed all scripts in out ANT build to use groovy. For Groovy, ideally use the <groovy/> ant task (installed by common-build when you depend on the corresponding install-groovy task. You can also use it with <scriptcondition/> or <script/> but this leads to permgen problems when called in every module. The reason for this is: <script/> creates a new classloader every time and loads a new groovy, while installing the <groovy/> ant task can be reused in sub-modules (so we only need to install top-level).\n\nSo I would rewrite the <scriptcondition> to a simple <groovy/> executed before the condition task, which sets a property thats used by the condition. Or alternatively directly throw a BuildException in the groovy without using a scriptcondition at all.\n\nI can provide a patch tomorrow. ",

The value added is minimal and the headaches with maintenance are huge. The problem is that any subant or ant call which doesn't pass the required properties to detect the \"top level\" build will break it. I don't think there's a hook in Ant to allow detection of the top-level build file. ",

            "content": "Hi Steve. This must be a regression again. The problem here is that it's very difficult to tell whether a module build is stand-alone or has been invoked by (some) parent ant process. In effect it's very difficult to tell whether there really was no tests or maybe it's just that tests have been filtered out for this particular module.\n\nI'm tired of this because it's such a pain to maintain and at the same time there are no good solutions \u2013 either somebody will be complaining that all tests can be filtered out and not cause a failure or experience what you have experienced.\n\nI'll see if there's a way to add this \"tests.ifNoTests\" property, but I don't see much sense to it \u2013 either the check for the total number of tests works or it doesn't. Why skip something that doesn't work anyway. ",
