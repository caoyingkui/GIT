I grabbed the trunk and replaced the file and the problem went away. I didn't go much further than that in trying to figure out what was causing the issue.\n\nI'm not sure when the snapshot was taken for Solr, but there was a bug that fixed intermittent failures of TestTimeLimitedCollector (LUCENE-1238) which may be a contributing cause.

I think Wayne is saying that the error occurs when using Solr trunk as it is, but when he replaces the Lucene jar checked in with Solr with a Lucene jar he built himself from Lucene trunk, it's fine. In that case we probably need to replace the Lucene jars checked in with Solr. Wayne, is this correct? "
