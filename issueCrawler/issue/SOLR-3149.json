    "description": "The version of example/example-DIH/solr/db/conf/schema.xml is 1.1 (too old) where example/solr/conf/schema.xml is 1.4. I believe that it is important to keep all schema.xml up to date for newbies.\n\nThe example/example-DIH/solr/db/conf/schema.xml will be referred as primary hints for newbies because most of them may want to try import some data from their preexisting DB or something first, referring [1]. Even DataImportHandler tutorial itself can be done without problem, obsolete schema.xml may confusing for them. \n\nTypical difference of new and old schema.xml is existence of explanation of *TrieField. Because old one's default types are solr.IntField or solr.DateField and no mention of this. Consequently, when they try range queries or boosting query based on old schema.xml, they may face unintended slow response or error.\n\n[1] http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DataImportHandler#Full_Import_Example",

(I was having some trouble getting them all to run in my enviornment).\n\nI've both updated the schemas and pared them down quite a bit to (mostly) only contain needed features.  There is also a new note to look for the main example config for more options.\n\nIf this seems good and all the examples still run ok I'll commit. "
