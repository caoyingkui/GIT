    "description": "For really costly filters, we want to be able to stop filtering (and accept everything else) after enough results have been accepted to fill the result page. This would not produce appropriate counts, but would allow offering acceptable response time for heavy filters (security calling back external system). This can only work if sorting is done before filtering though, so the proposition is to have a way of plugging in filtering after sorting has occurred.",
