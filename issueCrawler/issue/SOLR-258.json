Ideally we'd include one end but not the other (so no overlap) but that makes filterqueries to restrict by those rnages hard (even though queryparser supports inclusive or exclusive ranges it doesn't support a mix/match of inclusive on one side and exclusive on the other).  maybe we can have an \"interval\" param which defaults to one millisecond so ranges can allways be inclusive and still not overlap?\n\twhat should happen if \"end < start\" or \"gap < 0\" ... maybe those should be okay as long as both are true.\n\tshould we support hardcoded default values for start, end, and gap? ... for start it's easy to get the lowest value in the field, but what about gap and end?\n\n\n "

            "content": "This looks great Hoss.  Thanks!\n\nThe facet param interface look reasonable.  Structurally, I would like to see 'component' based params split into their own file - FacetParams should be similar to HighlightParams.  It seems funny to munge the get/set field bit with the expanding list of things we may get or set.  If we implement FacetParams as an interface (like HighlightParams), the deprecated class o.a.s.request.SolrParams could implement FacetParams.\n\nOne thing to note on FacetDateOther.get( string ), if you put in an invalid string, you will get IllegalArgumentException or NullPointer - not a 400 response code.  Perhaps somethign like:\n\n  public enum FacetDateOther {\n    PRE, POST, INNER, ALL, NONE;\n    public String toString() \n{ return super.toString().toLowerCase(); }\n    public static FacetDateOther get(String label) {\n      try \n{\n        return valueOf(label.toUpperCase());\n      }\n      catch( Exception ex ) \n{\n        throw new SolrException\n          (SolrException.ErrorCode.BAD_REQUEST,\n           label +\" is not a valid type of 'other' date facet information\", ex );\n      }\n    }\n  } \n\nPersonally, I like the sound of  \"before\", \"after\" and \"between\" better then \"pre\" \"post\" \"inner\".  before/after seem to sit nicely with the other parameters 'start' 'end'.

            "content": "I've just tried this patch and the results are impressive!\n\nI agree with Ryan regarding the naming of 'pre', 'post' and 'inner', using simple concrete words will make it easier for developers to understand the basic concepts.  At first I was a little confused how the 'gap' parameter was used, perhaps a name like 'interval' would be more indicative of it's purpose?\n\nWhile on the topic of gaps / intervals, I can imagine a case where one might want facet counts over non-linear intervals, for instance obtaining results from: \"Last 7 days\", \"Last 30 days\", \"Last 90 days\", \"Last 6 months\".  Obviously you can achieve this by setting facet.date.gap=+1DAY and then post-process the results, but a much more elegant solution would be to allow \"facet.date.gap\"  (or another suitably named param) to accept a (comma-delimited) set of explicit partition dates:\n\nfacet.date.start=NOW-6MONTHS/DAY\nfacet.date.end=NOW/DAY\nfacet.date.gap=NOW-90DAYS/DAY,NOW-30DAYS/DAY,NOW-7DAYS/DAY\n\nIt would then be trivial to calculate facet counts for the ranges specified above.\n\nIt would be useful to make the 'start' an 'end' parameters optional.  If not specified 'start' should default to the earliest stored date value, and 'end' should default to the latest stored date value (assuming that's possible).  Probably should return a 400 if 'gap' is not set.\n\nMy personal opinion is that 'end' should be a hard limit, the last gap should never go past 'end'.  Given that the facet label is always generated from the lower value in the range, I don't think truncating the last 'gap' will cause problems, however it may be helpful to return the actual date value for \"end\" if it was specified as a offset of NOW.\n\nWhat might be a problem is when both start and end dates are specified as offsets of NOW, the value of NOW may not be constant for both values.  In one of my tests, I set:\n\nfacet.date.start=NOW-12MONTHS\nfacet.date.end=NOW\nfacet.date.gap=+1MONTH\n\nWith some extra debugging output I can see that mostly the value of NOW is the same:\n\n<str name=\"start\">2006-07-13T06:06:07.397</str>\n<str name=\"end\">2007-07-13T06:06:07.397</str>\n\nHowever occasionally there is a difference:\n\n<str name=\"start\">2006-07-13T05:48:23.014</str>\n<str name=\"end\">2007-07-13T05:48:23.015</str>\n\nThis difference alters the number of gaps calculated (+1 when NOW values are diff for start & end).  Not sure how this could be fixed, but as you mentioned above, it will probably involve changing \"ft.toExternal(ft.toInternal(...))\".\n\nThanks again for creating this useful addition, I'll try to test it a bit more and see if I can find anything else.
