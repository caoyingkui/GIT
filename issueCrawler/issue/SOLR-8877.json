    "description": "The SolrCLI and the corresponding test use CommandLine.parse() of commons-exec, but in most cases the parameters are not correctly escaped.\n\nCommandLine.parse() should be placed on forbidden-apis list. This is not a valid way to build a command line and execute it. The correct war is to create an instance of the CommandLine class and then add the arguments one-by one:\n\n\n      org.apache.commons.exec.CommandLine startCmd = new org.apache.commons.exec.CommandLine(callScript);\n      startCmd.addArguments(new String[] {\n          \"start\",\n          cloudModeArg,\n          \"-p\",\n          Integer.toString(port),\n          \"-s\",\n          solrHome,\n          hostArg,\n          zkHostArg,\n          memArg,\n          extraArgs,\n          addlOptsArg\n      });\n\n\n\nI tried to fix it by using the approach, but the test then fails with other bugs on Windows. I disabled it for now if it detects whitespace in Solr's path. I think the reason might be that some of the above args are empty or are multi-args on itsself, so they get wrongly escaped.\n\nI have no idea how to fix it, but the current way fails completely on Windows, where most users have a whitespace in their home directory or in the \"C:\\Program Files\" folder.",
