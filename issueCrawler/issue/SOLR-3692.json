    "description": "When executing the query \"q=all_de_DE:Wissenschaft AND (article_id:test-inst-2172 OR article_id:test-inst-2155)\" with highlighting switched on solr issues \"Token typisch exceeds length of provided text sized 15879\". I'll provide our solr configuration, schema and the two documents as displayed by luke.\n\nQuerying a single article is no problem. Both \"q=all_de_DE:Wissenschaft AND article_id:test-inst-2172\" and \"q=all_de_DE:Wissenschaft AND article_id:test-inst-2155\" work as expected. The exception only occurs when the two given articles appear together in the result set.\n\nThis error does not occur when executing the query: \"q=all_de_DE:typisch AND (article_id:test-inst-2172 OR article_id:test-inst-2155)\", i.e. querying the token \"typisch\" itself.",
