In general the same can happen anywhere in the build, you just accidentally hit it while downloading Ivy. Cleaning up the IVY cache is a workaround for most of such issues, which is very similar to cleaning up the Maven cache when something goes wrong in Maven builds. \n\nThe documentation text should better be rm -rf ~/.ivy2/cache as general workaround, because it nukes the whole cache.\n\nThe \"ivy-bootstrap\" part in your added documentation should be conditional, so you should add it like: 'if you see an error about Ivy missing when invoking ant, call \"ant ivy-bootstrap\" and retry.'
