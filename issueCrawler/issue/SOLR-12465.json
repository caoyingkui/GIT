            "content": "It makes sense to me what you mentioned in the other issue - that triggers may consider a fraction of waitFor as the basis for how often they check cluster state. However, this depends on trigger implementation and how likely it is to miss important state change between samples.\n\nIn case of nodeLost / nodeAdded the condition will persist for a relatively long time, so it makes sense to track it less closely (although we need to consider the \"flaky node\" scenario too, see SOLR-11730). Search rate trigger samples a 1-min average metric, so it's probably also ok if it checks less frequently.\n\nTriggers should also check that their waitFor is at least twice as long as the `triggerScheduleDelaySeconds`.
