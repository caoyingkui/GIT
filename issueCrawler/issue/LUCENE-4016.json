This is documented at http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/javac.html and is the expected behavior.\n\nWhat is the effect of this on javadocs? I intentionally added checks to flush out 'secret' javadocs for packages that had no classes, because its a sign they should really be in overview.html or restructured somehow (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1328844&view=rev). Will this break that?\n\nI know, its funky how the check works, by allowing it (includenosourcepackages=\"true\"), we cause a javadocs warning\nto occur as a side effect (versus silently discarding the documentation), failing the build  ",
