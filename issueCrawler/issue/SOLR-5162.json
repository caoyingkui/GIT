The tricksy part here is that these prefixes are not present in the core.properties file, so we need to add them in/strip them out at the appropriate times.\n\nThe only call where the 'solr.' prefix needs to be present is in the Properties object returned by CoreDescriptor.getCoreProperties(), and this method is only ever called when creating ResourceLoaders, so we should be able to safely isolate the changes here.

The test setup is a bit complicated, because the standard TestHarness setup doesn't use a CoreContainer or CoreDescriptor to set up its cores, so substitutions won't work.  Which is less than ideal, but that's for another issue.\n\nShawn Heisey, does this fix your setup? "
