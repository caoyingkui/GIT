I think sectors of the circle start overlapping to each other and the shape becomes invalid. The shape should prevent that to happen.\n\nI will attach a test and a proposed solution.",

            "content": "Attached is a test showing the issue and a possible solution.\n\nThe solution (I propose) tries to prevent such circles to be constructed. The (maybe naive) assumption is that we should not allow circles that contain antipodal points. I was hoping to find a way to know the shorter distance the antipodal points on a planet but it seems harder than I expected. It seems to work to choose the smaller distance between the poles of the planet (at least for WGS84-like planets). What do you think?\n\nP.S: I have changed the message of a thrown error as it should not be true any more.  ",
