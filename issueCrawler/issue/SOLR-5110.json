    "description": "The collection1 example uses the query analyzer from \"text_general\" FieldType as \"queryAnalyzerFieldType\" in the SpellCheck component.\n\nNow if someone removes this from the SpellCheckComponent configuration the query uses WhiteSpaceAnalyzer.\n\nI think we could change this to SimpleAnalyzer so that spell check results for \"foo\" and \"Foo\" give the same results. We should also log if the fieldType is not found.\n\nAre there more places in solrconfig which have dependencies on schema?",
