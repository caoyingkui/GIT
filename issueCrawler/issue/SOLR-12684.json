    "description": "The aim of this Jira is to beef up the ref guide around parallel stream\n\nThere are two things I want to address:\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirstly usage of\u00a0partitionKeys\u00a0:\n\nThis line in the ref guide indicates that parallel stream keys should always be the same as the underlying sort criteria\u00a0\n\nThe parallel function maintains the sort order of the tuples returned by the worker nodes, so the sort criteria of the parallel function must match up with the sort order of the tuples returned by the workers.\n\n\nBut as discussed on SOLR-12635 , Joel provided an example\n\nThe hash partitioner just needs to send documents to the same worker node. You could do that with just one partitioning key\n\nFor example if you sort on year, month and day. You could partition on year only and still be fine as long as there was enough different years to spread the records around the worker nodes.\n\nSo we should make this more clear in the ref guide.\n\nLet's also document that specifying more than 4 partitionKeys will throw an error after\u00a0SOLR-12683\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt this point the user will understand how to use\u00a0partitonKeys . It's related to the sort criteria but should not have all the sort fields\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe should now mention a trick where the user could warn up the hash queries as they are always run on the whole document set ( irrespective of the filter criterias )\n\nalso users should only use parallel when the docs matching post filter criterias is very large .\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<listener event=\"newSearcher\" class=\"solr.QuerySenderListener\">\n<arr name=\"queries\">\n\n<lst><str name=\"q\">:</str><str name=\"fq\">{!hash workers=6 worker=0}</str><str name=\"partitionKeys\">myPartitionKey</str></lst>\n<lst><str name=\"q\">:</str><str name=\"fq\">{!hash workers=6 worker=1}</str><str name=\"partitionKeys\">myPartitionKey</str></lst>\n<lst><str name=\"q\">:</str><str name=\"fq\">{!hash workers=6 worker=2}</str><str name=\"partitionKeys\">myPartitionKey</str></lst>\n<lst><str name=\"q\">:</str><str name=\"fq\">{!hash workers=6 worker=3}</str><str name=\"partitionKeys\">myPartitionKey</str></lst>\n<lst><str name=\"q\">:</str><str name=\"fq\">{!hash workers=6 worker=4}</str><str name=\"partitionKeys\">myPartitionKey</str></lst>\n<lst><str name=\"q\">:</str><str name=\"fq\">{!hash workers=6 worker=5}</str><str name=\"partitionKeys\">myPartitionKey</str></lst>\n</arr>\n</listener>",
