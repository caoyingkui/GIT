It's hard to say what direction we go right now though - some have argued even non zookeeper mode should be single install zookeeper mode instead. Has it's advantages and disadvantages I think. For me, I can really only take it an issue at a team, and while I hope to drive some more things around SolrCloud soon, it's obviously been a while. Others have some issues open, but more ideas are always good.\n\nI certainly agree that CoreContainer could be modularized better - would help for testing too. I have an issue to do this for the persistence code (baby steps  ), but feel free to open further issues.\n\nI somewhat took the easy route in integrating zookeeper - there are certainly lots of improvements that could be made overall. And TODO's to finish - I think a couple guys have done a few from the wiki in various issues, and I know loggly has privately impl'd a couple from their talk at revolution (would be cool to see that come back, but I know they are busy guys). I love TODO's - minimal effort, but when you put one at a future pain point, your code doesn't look so stupid even when it's not perfect yet \n\nWe should discuss in other issues though. "

HBase + Solr can help with massive scale near realtime systems you've described, eg, HBase implements splitting, partitioning, a fast write ahead log, etc.  Facebook has implemented the index directly into HBase, which probably offers degraded indexing and search performance.\n\nWe badly need the cloud features now\n\nRight, many users are going with Elastic Search for the reasons mentioned.
