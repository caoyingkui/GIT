The error is clear \u2013 your solrconfig did not have the admin handlers enabled which is why the admin interface failed to load.\n\nIt is best to post on the solr-user mailing list before opening issues on Jira. If you think this is still a problem, please shoot an email on the mailing list and we can re-open the issue if required. "
