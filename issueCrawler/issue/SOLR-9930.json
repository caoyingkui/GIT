    "description": "The documentation regarding which dependencies that have to be added in order to activate e.g. the ICU analyzer is incomplete. This leads to unnecessary trouble for the user when they have to find the missing dependencies themselves, especially since the error message in the logs and Solr GUI doesn't give a clear hint on what's missing.\n\nI've created a pull request with updated documentation.",

While I can reproduce including ICUTokenizerFactory in my schema and failing to load, it is not cured by simply adding solr-analysis-extras.X.Y.jar to my lib directive in solrconfig so something else is going on.\n\nWhat version of Solr are you using?

What I'm trying to help clarify is that solr-analysis-extra.X.Y.jar is needed together with the icu jars, who are already mentioned as dependencies in the readme. To make that clearer I updated the pull request.\n\nI'm using Solr 6.3.0. I've also tried this in Solr 6.2.0. ",
