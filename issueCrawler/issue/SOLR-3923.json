    "description": "This is similar to SOLR-3377.  That bug appears to have fixed this problem for 4.x.\n\nI can see the effects of SOLR-3377 when I test a query similar to below on the Solr 3.6 example, which is expected because SOLR-3377 was found in 3.6 but only fixed in 4.0.  This bug is a little different, and exists in 3.5.0 for sure, possibly earlier.  The first part of the parsed query looks right, but then something weird happens and it gets interpreted as a very strange phrase query.\n\nquery URL sent to solr 3.5.0 example:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=%28%28cat%3Astring1%29+%28Kitchen+Sink%29%29&wt=xml&debugQuery=true&defType=edismax&qf=text&pf=text^2.0\n\n\n\nparsedquery_toString:\n\n+((cat:string1 ((text:kitchen) (text:sink)))~2) (text:\"cat:string1 kitchen sink\"^2.0)\n\n\n\nAdding some spaces before and after cat:string1 fixes it:\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=%28%28%20cat%3Astring1%20%29+%28Kitchen+Sink%29%29&wt=xml&debugQuery=true&defType=edismax&qf=text&pf=text^2.0\n\n\n\n\n+((cat:string1 ((text:kitchen) (text:sink)))~2) (text:\"kitchen sink\"^2.0)",
