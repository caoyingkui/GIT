            "content": "+1 looks fine.  Did you contribute this simply because, after having done the UnifiedHighlighter, doing this was easy since it's almost the same code so might as well, or do you actually use the PostingsHighlighter over the UnifiedHighlighter?  If the latter I'd like to hear how the UH isn't meeting your needs.  The UnifiedHighlighter is essentially an evolved version of the PostingsHighlighter. ",

I understand UnifiedSolrHighlighter is the most flexible one in terms of configuration compared to other three available( including the default). As PostingsSolrHighlighter is the ancestor, I thought it would be better if this particular configuration is also backported. I will let you and others in the community decide if it is. Thank you for your feedback. ",
