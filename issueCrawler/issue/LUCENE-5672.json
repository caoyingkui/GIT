            "content": "IIRC, I changed that on LUCENE-2245. The core motivation was to keep the addIndexes versions doing the minimal work that's required for them to function properly. So the Directory version merely copies the files over to the target index and the Reader version migrates them to the target index. Other than that, we should let the MP workout the best merges to execute etc.\n\nThis lets the caller decide how expensive should addIndexes be, on his part. You can freely call forceMerge/maybeMerge before/after addIndexes, or not execute merges at all. I found this beneficial e.g. when creating indexes via MapReduce, where I used addIndexes, but wanted to wait with merges until the end. When addIndexes always calls maybeMerge, it means it always does this work, and the only way to avoid that is use NoMergePolicy. Perhaps NoMP came after the addIndexes cleanup, not sure...\n\nI like it that addIndexes does the minimum work that's needed. Can you elaborate why is this buggy? What prevents the app from invoking merges itself? I mean, this is not like addDocument() calls ... I believe that addIndexes are less common, and more ... expert? ",

This is a bug.\n\nI was leaning towards Shai's argument at first, but after a bit of deeper thought, I agree with Robert.\n\nI don't know that having an option to not use the merge policy will add any confusion if the default is right, but it does seem the merge policy itself is sufficient for cases I can think of. I don't know that you need this extra way to control merges. ",

The most common case is when merge policy parameters have changed\". So requiring the user to manually invoke this after index operations to prevent segment explosion is wrong IMO. ",
