Super early stuff, just working on getting frameworks out so we can iterate, but has a basic collection lock impl, and assigns 3 slices before it starts evenly adding replicas.\n\nStill need a way to set the number of slices (core creation param?) - it's conveniently hard coded to 3.\n\nMight want to make this pluggable, but def not yet.
