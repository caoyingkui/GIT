    "description": "We initially just took most of this code from hbase which will wait for up to 15 minutes. This doesn't seem ideal - we should give up sooner and treat the file as not recoverable.\n\nWe also need to fix the possible data loss message. This is really the same as if a transaction log on local disk were to become corrupt, and if you have a replica to recover from, things will be fine.",
