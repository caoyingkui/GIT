    "description": "SVN r1055285 (committed for LUCENE-2391) introduced a hard limit on the minimum length required before including a word in the spell checker.  This not only shows all 2-letter words as misspelled/not existing (unless the caller agrees that 2-letter words should not be checked for spelling) but 2-letter suggestions will never show up in a call to suggestSimilar().  It would be nice to have this limit reduced or, ideally, not hard-coded.",
