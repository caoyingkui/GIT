There are missing files in lucene/licenses/ for the new dependency: a checksum file (*.sha1), a LICENSE file and a NOTICE file.  You can generate the checksum file using ant jar-checksums, but you'll need to manually create the other two.  You can create morfologik-ukrainian-search.LICENSE-ASL.txt by copying from another file in that directory that contains a clean ALv2 license, e.g. commons-codec-LICENSE-ASL.txt.  I'm fuzzy on the requirements for the NOTICE file, but look at the other NOTICE files in that dir to get an idea of the range of things they contain.
