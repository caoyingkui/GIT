    "description": "Currently to build a release, its a huge battle to get the smoke tester \"up to speed\"\nso the checks are actually current and everything works, and its python so\nits pretty fragile (no compile time checking).\n\nSo I think its time to do this in the nightly build, otherwise release managers, python\ngurus, policeman, and whoever just likes punishment has to do a lot of work before the release\nto adapt to all the changes: its easier to keep this stuff maintained incrementally.\n\nWe need a top-level task 'nightly-smoke' that does prepare-release-no-sign for lucene + solr,\nthen smoke tests it and fails if the smoke tester fails.",
