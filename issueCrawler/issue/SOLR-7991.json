            "content": "Please raise questions like this on the user's list before raising a JIRA as this is much more a usage question than a known code issue.\n\nSwapping cores (and, IMO, most of the Core Admin UI) should be avoided if at all possible in SolrCloud, think collections instead and use the Collections API. In this case to swap collections, see CREATEALIAS here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Collections+API\n\nNOTE: the core admin API works fine in SolrCloud, and in fact is the basis for many of the actions in the collections API. But you have to get it exactly right or you can create problems for yourself. The Collections API is a much better choice unless you really understand all of the implications. ",
