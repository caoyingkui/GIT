Extended dismax already implements this.\n\nIt comes down to needing a flag... sometimes you want pure negative queries (when parsing query parts for example) and sometimes you don't.  We should just add a boolean flag to SolrQueryParser.\n\nBut we don't want to do this for the top level for filter queries - as an optimization, solr currently caches -foo:x the same as foo:x and if we always handled negative queries at the QP level, it would disable that.
