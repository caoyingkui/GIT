Rather than hard-coding to \"collection1\" allow this to be specified in the initCore method.",

I found there was some discussion on the mailing list. I'm happy to take a first pass at this if you think it'd help.\n\nAs far as i know the only docs are the javadocs in the base classes and test harness \u2013 if you'd like to take a stab at adding useful content to solr/test-framework/src/java/overview.html that would be awesome! (but perhaps deal with thta in a separate jira/patch so it doesn't hold up this already useful fix?) "
