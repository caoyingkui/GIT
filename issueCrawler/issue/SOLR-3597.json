            "content": "here is a very hackish patch i reverse engineered using the DOM Inspector in firefox.\n\nmost likely this patch shouldn't be used as is w/o other CSS changes or what not \u2013 in particularly i just kind of left the <p id=\"environment\">\u00a0</p> paragraph sitting there above the \"main\" box, and i supsect that if we are going to move the logo like this, that para tag should move somewhere else ... which would then raise questions about wether the \"wrapper\" div is still needed, which i'm sure affects css, etc...\n\nthe point is i'm posting it wo you can see the end result i'm advocating for, not because i think this is the right way to get that end result\n\n(tangent: it's not really clear to me what that \"environment\" para is for.  i see javascript that either populates it or kills it depending on what it finds in the command line args, but it's not really clear to my why those specific args are special ... is this doc'ed anywhere? .. even just an HTML/javascript comment explaining  what the deal is would be helpful) "

No idea why the header was left untouched while other things also changed .. but this looks really good (at least for me).\n\n.. and i supsect that if we are going to move the logo like this, that para tag should move somewhere else ...\n\nplayed around with the structure, what may fit is: moving the complete header block inside the menu-wrapper. with the current stylesheet the environment box is moved to the top, but disabling the position-definition in css would help. then we would have (see the following as a screen mock):\n\n\n[logo]\n[enviroment]\n[navigation]\n\n\nin that case the navigation will move a bit down, but that should be okay.\n\nmost likely this patch shouldn't be used as is w/o other CSS changes or what not \n\ni'll try to have a look at the weekend (beside finishing a few other patches ;o) "
