    "description": "We had a hack since LUCENE-5385 in our build, because svnkit 1.8.0 - 1.8.3 were not able to read svn 1.7 checkouts. Because of this the user had to choose the right svnkit version when executing ant check-svn-working-copy.\n\nSince svnkit 1.8.4 we can read all svn working copy formats again, so our checks will work on any checkout without forcefully choosing svnkit version.\n\nThis patch removes the extra warnings and error messages and update to 1.8.4.",
