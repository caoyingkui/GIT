            "content": "Thanks Marius.\n\nI'm attaching a modified patch:\n\nYou switched TestBulkSchemaAPI to using the to-be-deprecated (SOLR-6594) non-bulk API, via extra servlet setup in before(), AFAICT so that you could get the showDefaults behavior, which is not available with the bulk Schema API.  But this is a bug in FieldType.getNamedPropertyValues(): it only outputs similarity when showDefaults=true, but it should instead always do so.  My version of the patch fixes this bug.  (This is a round-tripping problem: manual testing shows that when managed schema is persisted, per-field-type similarity is currently dropped, which is bad.)\n\nI was then able to revert TestBulkSchemaAPI to the previously used bulk schema API, since showDefaults is no longer necessary to get the per-field-type similarity to show up in the schema api response.\n\nI think this is ready.  I'll commit after running Solr tests and precommit.\n\nIn my testing I noticed that SchemaSimilarityFactory, a prerequisite for setting per-field-type similarity, is not the default in any of Solr's example schemas.  See http://markmail.org/message/7icpmwmdhfw4tmwv and SOLR-3577 for rationale.\n\nWe need to let people know that in order to set per-field-type similarity, they need to first set the global similarity to SchemaSimilarityFactory or something like it.  Unfortunately the Schema API can't yet set the global similarity - see SOLR-7242.  I'll leave a comment there about the need to check/update the Solr Reference Guide for this. ",
