We don't want this by default, especially for indexing requests.\n\n'repeatable' means 'can this HTTP request be sent again'. We do not want to resend an indexing request, especially one that failed.\n\nThis seems to come from some kind of protocol error. The SolrJ client should just fail and report the error. "

            "content": "isRepeatable means the payload stream can be read more than once. This can be necessary due to authentication and io errors. It doesn't mean that if you send an index command and it fails in Solr that the index command will be sent again. This is at the HTTP layer.\n\nIt also doesn't mean, please do retries - it simply means that the data can be read more than once, so you can do what's appropriate (retrying on re-triable errors) rather than failing with this exception - many times you can not reread a stream unless you provide a mechanism to get a fresh stream. \n\nBasically - I'm not seeing the problem you are about retries.\n\nWhat is possibly happening here:\n\nThe HTTPClient sends the request with the payload, which gets read - but its an authenticated zone, so the client is challenged - it responds again with the username/password and the payload - which fails on the next read. Thats just a guess. Perhaps its just an authentication/io anomaly that a retry is often used to correct.\n\nBased on the info I have though, I'm not convinced that failing and reporting the error is the right way to go.
