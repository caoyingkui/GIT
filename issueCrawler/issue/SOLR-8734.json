None of the cores has either parameter configured. Is this expected?\n...\n\nChristine Poerschke replied:\n...\nCould you advise if/that the solrconfig.xml has a <mergePolicy> element (for which deprecated warnings would appear separately) or that the solrconfig.xml has no <mergePolicyFactory> element?\n...\nIf either is the case then yes based on the code (SolrIndexConfig.java#L153) the warnings would be expected-and-harmless though admittedly are confusing, and fixable.\n...",

Though perhaps that is too controversional a change in general or for any future 5.5.1 release in particular? ",

Even while working on the previous issue I thought that we should be able to detect the existence of <mergeFactor> element in the .xml, and not compare the value to the default. What happens if someone includes both <mergePolicyFactory> and <mergeFactor> set to the default value? Would we also fail? ",

The motivation perhaps being that when SOLR-8668 removes <mergePolicy> (and <mergeFactor>) element support the <mergeFactor>-1</mergeFactor> likely would remain behind as a zombie element?\n\nMight we go even further than detecting the existence of a deprecated <mergeFactor> element and detect any and all unsupported elements? Unsupported elements could be simple typos on part of the user e.g. <mergePolicyFactor> instead of <mergePolicyFactory> or they could be misplaced elements e.g. test-files/solr/collection1/conf/solrconfig-spellcheckcomponent.xml seems to have indexConfig/query/maxWarmingSearchers when possibly query/maxWarmingSearchers was intended (SOLR-8682 exists for that).
