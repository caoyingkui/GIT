            "content": "This is a very interesting and educational question. The fact that the /update is a base is not well explained anywhere. I just run the test\n\njava -Durl=http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/update2 -Dauto -jar post.jar *\n\nAnd it did do POST /solr/techproducts/update2/extract for the PDF file. Not what I expected somehow.\n\nMy main concern is reducing the magic through a better message. If somebody posted a file and something unexpected happened, they would troubleshoot it by following the request handler and it's parameters as one of the steps. But we don't tell them here which request handler it is. We give only one piece of information here that just happen to also be a valid request handler.\n\nThey could pick that information up from the log file I guess if they had access to it and knew what to look for. But it would be easier if the tool was more clear about it, as it does not know exactly what happened.\n\nWhat if we add something like this to the message:\n\nPOSTing file books.csv (text/csv) to [base]\nPOSTing file solr-word.pdf (application/pdf) to [base]/extract\n\nWhere the word [base] is just that - the word.\n\nThis could also clarify a bit the situation with the fact that XML, CSV, and JSON go to the same handler, yet we have - slightly confusingly - request handlers for both CSV and JSON in the solrconfig.xml.\n\nThe help message for the tool needs to be improved as well. It says solr-update-url and nothing about base and suffixes. ",
