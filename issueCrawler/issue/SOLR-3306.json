    "description": "This is not an \"issue\" as such, rather it's a proposal for an enhancement. When using the Solr UIMA-plugin I run into \"connection timeout errors\" as our Solr-instance is running behind a firewall and the UIMA-plugin is unable to connect to, say, the Alchemy-API service. I've tried to specify JAVA_OPTS settings to no avail. It would be great if there would be a possibility to specify proxy settings in the solrconfig.xml file, thus making it possible to route http-calls through that proxy.",
