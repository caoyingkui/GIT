    "description": "I think NRTManager can be drastically simplified by moving all of its\nlogic into a new reopen thread class.  All logic for waiting for a\nspecific generation and reopening at different rates would live in\nthis class.\n\nThis would fully decouple the \"wait for generation X to be visible\"\nfrom which particular ReferenceManager impl you're using, which would\nmake it possible to use the controlled consistency approach of\nNRTManager with any managers (e.g. SearcherTaxonomyManager).",
