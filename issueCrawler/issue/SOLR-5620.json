I think that protected all reads and sets of the state? I'm not sure, I'd have to spend some more time on it. Someone else was involved in a lot of that refactoring, so I don't have a complete memory of it. Not positive if it was even need for the reads then, but who knows what all the code look like at the time.\n\nI can't see how we need it for reading the aliases though - but we do want that volatile of course.
