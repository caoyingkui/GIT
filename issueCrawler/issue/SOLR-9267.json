    "description": "When boosting by field \"fieldname otherFieldName^4.0\" the boost is not stripped from the field name when adding to fieldNames ArrayList.  So on line 133 of CloudMLTQParser when adding field content to the filteredDocument the field is not found (incorrectly trying to find 'otherFieldName^4.0').\n\nThe easiest but perhaps hackiest solution is to overwrite qf:\n\nif (localParams.get(\"boost\") != null) {\n\tmlt.setBoost(localParams.getBool(\"boost\"));\n\tboostFields = SolrPluginUtils.parseFieldBoosts(qf);\n\tqf = boostFields.keySet().toArray(qf);\n}",

It also fixes the filteredDocument creation so that IndexableField type is not directly cast to a string as that would include strings like \"indexed\" and \"stored\" and throw the results off if those are included in the indexed records.\n\nAs far as I can see this should work in the 6_2 branch too (apart from CHANGES.txt obviously).
