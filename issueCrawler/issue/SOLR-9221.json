It just brings problems:\n\n\tWe cannot change some Solr APIs (removing deprecations), because the code in morphlines uses those Solr APIs (circular dependency).\n\tWe cannot update TIKA, because it depends on a really antique version of it.\n\tThere seems to be no maintainer of this contrib anymore. There are tons of issues open, and none of them are fixed. I have no idea how to fix them, as the whole thing (kite moprphlines) is a black box.\n\n ",

I am also sure that Cloudera is not happy to donate all code.\n\tFix morphlines to not depend on Solr and TIKA directly. We have no control about this, but I am sure Mark might be able to open issues about that on kitesdk. If we would need to add the TIKA adaptors into Solr then, I would be fine. But the current dependency-hell is a no-go.\n\tRemove the contrib and ship the (full) Solr support with Kitesdk. I'd prefer this. The three contribs are just some client for solr, so why does it need to be inside Solr's repository?\n\n\n\nI still think that #3 is the only option to go. ",
