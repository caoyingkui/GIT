The Elevation component requires you have a uniqueKey, but that doesn't mean uniqueKeys are mandatory for all indexes \u2013 it just means thta feature is smart enough to check when it's prereqs aren't met.  QueryParser doesn't support \"special charcters\" in field names, but that doesn't mean we should explicitly forbid them.\n\nI don't even understand why LukeRequestHandler is using QueryParser ... it's just building an unbounded RangeQuery to find out how many documents contain this field... that can be done without parsing.

A field name like \"name with spaces_t\" resulted in a query for \"name with spaces_t:[* TO *]\" which would give you the count of docs with a value in the \"spaces_t\" field or contained \"name\" or \"with\" in the defaultSearchField.\n\nCommitted revision 792751.
