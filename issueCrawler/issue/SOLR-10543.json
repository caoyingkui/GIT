    "description": "Using method=stream for JSON field faceting avoids building up any data structures in memory and calculates each bucket individually before writing it out to the response.  This comes at a cost of only being able to produce the buckets in index order.\n\nWe should add support for sorting by different criteria (count or facet function), do the minimum needed to calculate the bucket ordering, and then stream the rest (including subfacets).",
