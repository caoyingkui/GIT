    "description": "Per discussion in SOLR-9764 Design a memory efficient DocSet if a query returns all docs, if a DocSet matches most of documents, current implementation using BitDocSet can be optimized. This JIRA is to evaluate and design an optimized DocSet for these use cases. \n\nThe basic idea is to use an inverted integer list to enumerate all doc ids that doesn't match. If the DocSet matches most of docs, it can be pretty efficient. Meanwhile other ideas are welcome.",
