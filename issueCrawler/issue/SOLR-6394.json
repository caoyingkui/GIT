    "description": "Currently it is only possible to add synonyms and deleting single synonyms. If you need to delete all synonyms you have to get the list and then sending an delete request to every single synonym. Also you can't overwrite a synonym but only append it.\n\nIt would be more convenient to have additional possibilities:\n\nDeleting all synonyms\ncurl -XDELETE http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/schema/analysis/synonyms/english/\n\nOverwriting a single synonym \ncurl -XPUT http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/schema/analysis/synonyms/english/apple\n\nAdd a synonym / append to an existing synonym\ncurl -XPOST http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/schema/analysis/synonyms/english/apple",
