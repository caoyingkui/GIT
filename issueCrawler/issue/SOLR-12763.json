            "content": "Patch for adding the upgrade notes for 7.5. It includes some changes to other pages for adding or clarifying params for mergePolicy and also field requirements for uniqueId.\n\nTrying something new with the upgrade notes, which is to add a bold \"heading\" to break up the traditional bullet list like what's in CHANGES.txt. Hopefully that will help people more easily see things that might impact them either before they upgrade or after they've upgraded and are wondering why something changed.\n\nI'll let this patch sit an hour or so and then push to the branches.
