    "description": "The topic expression already stores the checkpoints for a topic. This ticket will allow the topic to store the topic query and a macro to be performed with the topic. \n\nMacros will be run using Solr's built-in parameter substitution:\n\nSample syntax:\n\n\ntopic(collection1, q=\"*:*\", macro=\"update(classify(model, ${topic}))\")\n\n\n\nThe query and macro will be stored with the topic. Topics can be retrieved and executed as part of the larger macro using Solr's built in parameter substitution.\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/stream?expr=update(classify(model, ${topic}))&topic=topic(collection1,....)\n\n\n\nBecause topics are stored in a SolrCloud collection this will allow for storing millions of topics and macros.\n\nThe parallel function can then be used to run the topics/macros in parallel across a large number of workers.",
