What happens when someone changes the demo?  Now we have to keep this demo code exactly the same lest we also want to update the dependencies in the main source as well.  I suppose it isn't a big deal since it is only one file, but it just seems like an unnecessary dependency.  Ideally, the FileDocument would live in some common place, but I am not sure where that would be.\n\nI don't include the demo source under my source tree in intellij, so it always complains at me (I hate those red squiggly marks),  but I suppose I can get over it for this one file.

I think the bigger issues are the consequences of the demo being changed and that it just doesn't feel right.  \n\nIn my mind, the Test code is for testing the core, not the demo.  The demo, in my mind is a sample application using the core and has nothing to do with testing the core.  To me the demo feels more akin to the contrib area then the core area and I think you would agree that the core tests should not be depend on anything in contrib, right?\n\nAt any rate, I am not trying to create an aesthetics war here, so at this point I will leave it to the committers to decide.

The demo is small enough that I don't think this is a concern. ",

Looking into the code you can replace the call of FileDocument in TestDoc with just 2 lines:\n\nDocument doc = new Document();\ndoc.add(new Field(\"contents\", new FileReader(file)));\n\n\n\nWith this change alone we could remove the dependency. I think we should do that because it makes the build cleaner and I don't think we'll pay less attention to the demo code in the future just because we remove this classpath dependency. Any objections? Otherwise I'll reopen this issue and attach a patch. ",
