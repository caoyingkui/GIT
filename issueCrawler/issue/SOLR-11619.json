But AFAICT it's broken, which I discovered while writing tests in SOLR-11299.  The code will trigger an NPE since it seems to get to an action state of PROCESS yet there is no core or config.",

I decided to move the \"path\" manipulation out of extractRemotePath so that we have the nice property that it's only ever updated from init() without exceptions... plus it makes it easier to call by V2.\n\nThere is no explicit test admittedly :-/   except that SOLR-11542 triggers this bug and it now works.\n\nNoble Paul could you please take a look?
