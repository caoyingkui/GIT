    "description": "When BooleanScorer2 runs the top collection loop (one of its\nscore(Collector)) methods, it uses a local \"doc\" var, ie:\n\n\npublic void score(Collector collector) throws IOException {\n    collector.setScorer(this);\n    int doc;\n    while ((doc = countingSumScorer.nextDoc()) != NO_MORE_DOCS) {\n      collector.collect(doc);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThe problem is, if the child collector calls scorer.doc() it will\nalways get -1.  Most Collectors don't actually call scorer.doc(), but\none important one that does is ScoreCachingWrapperScorer, as it uses\nthe doc to know when to invalidate its cache.  Since this always\nreturns -1, the ScoreCachingWrapperScorer keeps returning score=0.0 to\nits caller, thus messing up a SortField.SCORE comparator instance if\nit's included in the sort fields.",
