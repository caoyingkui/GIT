    "description": "LUCENE-3555 added explicit stats methods to indexsearcher, but you must\nsubclass to override this (e.g. populate with distributed stats).\n\nIts also impossible to then do this with SearcherManager.\n\nOne idea is make this a factory method (or similar) on IndexSearcher instead,\nso you don't need to subclass it to override.\n\nThen you can initialize this in a SearcherWarmer, except there is currently\na lot of hair in what this warming should be. This is a prime example where\nSearcher has different meaning from Reader, we should clean this up.\n\nOtherwise, lets make NRT/SearcherManager subclassable in such a way that \nyou can return a custom indexsearcher.",
