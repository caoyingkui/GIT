Unfortunately the ReturnFields constructor currently does parsing.\n\nIf we extract the parsing code into a static method of ReturnFields, then the class can be a simple container, and I can have my alternate parsing code to fill it.",

            "content": "Thanks Ryan: here's an updated patch. I added javadocs (since its a new abstract class). \n\nAlso i just made all the members abstract: having some of the concrete stuff might be confusing to subclasses and cause strange things to happen (e.g. if they forget to set _wantsAllFields but returned null from getLuceneFieldNames). So I think this is less error-prone. "
