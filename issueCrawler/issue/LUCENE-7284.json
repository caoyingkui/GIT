    "description": "I am trying to support synonyms on the query side by doing \nquery expansion.\n\nFor example, the query \"open webpage\" can be expanded if the following \nthings are synonyms:\n\n\"open\" | \"go to\"\n\nThis becomes the following: (I'm using both the stop word filter and the \nstemming filter)\n\n\nspanNear(\n         [\n                 spanOr([Title:open, Title:go]),\n                 Title:webpag\n         ],\n         0,\n         true\n)\n\n\n\nNotice that \"go to\" became just \"go\", because apparently \"to\" is removed \nby the stop word filter.\n\nInterestingly, if you turn \"go to webpage\" into a phrase, you get \"go ? \nwebpage\", but if you turn \"go to\" into a phrase, you just get \"go\", \nbecause apparently a trailing stop word in a PhraseQuery gets dropped. \n(there would actually be no way to represent the gap currently because \nit represents gaps implicitly via the position of the phrase tokens, and \nif there is no second token, there's no way to implicitly indicate that \nthere is a gap there)\n\nThe above query then fails to match \"go to webpage\", because \"go to \nwebpage\" in the index tokenizes as \"go _ webpage\", and the query, \nbecause it lost its gap, tried to only match \"go webpage\".\n\nTo try and work around that, I represent \"go to\" not as a phrase, but as \na SpanNearQuery, like this:\n\n\nspanNear(\n         [\n                 spanOr(\n                         [\n                                 Title:open,\n                                 spanNear([Title:go, SpanGap(:1)], 0, true),\n                         ]\n                 ),\n                 Title:webpag\n         ],\n         0,\n         true\n)\n\n\n\nHowever, when I run that query, I get the following:\n\n\nA Java exception occurred: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNearQuery$GapSpans.positionsCost(SpanNearQuery.java:398)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.ConjunctionSpans.asTwoPhaseIterator(ConjunctionSpans.java:96)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.NearSpansOrdered.asTwoPhaseIterator(NearSpansOrdered.java:45)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.ScoringWrapperSpans.asTwoPhaseIterator(ScoringWrapperSpans.java:88)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.ConjunctionDISI.addSpans(ConjunctionDISI.java:104)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.ConjunctionDISI.intersectSpans(ConjunctionDISI.java:82)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.ConjunctionSpans.<init>(ConjunctionSpans.java:41)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.NearSpansOrdered.<init>(NearSpansOrdered.java:54)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNearQuery$SpanNearWeight.getSpans(SpanNearQuery.java:232)\n     at \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanWeight.scorer(SpanWeight.java:134)\n     at org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanWeight.scorer(SpanWeight.java:38)\n     at org.apache.lucene.search.Weight.bulkScorer(Weight.java:135)\n\n\n\n... and when I look up that GapSpans class in SpanNearQuery.java, I see:\n\n\n@Override\npublic float positionsCost() {\n   throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n}\n\n\n\nI asked this question on the mailing list on May 14 and was directed to submit a bug here.\n\nThis issue is of relatively high priority for us, since this represents the most promising technique we have for supporting synonyms on top of Lucene. (since the SynonymFilter suffers serious issues wrt multi-word synonyms)",
