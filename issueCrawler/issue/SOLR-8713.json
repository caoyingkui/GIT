Also the solr ref guide PDF provides not only query syntax help, but is the full reference guide for Solr. In case that the link would point towards this PDF, the name of the link would need to be changed to \"Solr Reference Guide\".\nNevertheless, the current link http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrQuerySyntax points towards  Solr 4.x wiki. The solr query syntax link was until recently pointing towards to the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Query+Syntax+and+Parsing (from admin.html ) webpage. IMO the link should still point to the confluence query link.\n\nIt would be nice if the Confluence doc was per-release in addition to the development version\nI guess the reason why there is only the one (latest) version of the document present in the wiki, is to avoid the duplication of maintenance.

A lot of the content has gotten out of date, but other parts of it are updated regularly and have fully current information.\n\nThat older wiki needs an overhaul.  Some of the information needs to be removed because the information in the reference guide is better and completely supersedes what's there now, but there is still some value in having duplicate information for certain topics, because the wiki version can be presented differently, in a format that's better for quick lookups than the reference guide, which is intended to be full documentation.  A good example of this is the following page:\n\nhttps://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters\n\nI use this page all the time, because it's easily searchable for a particular analysis component and has quick-n-dirty examples.  I don't recall seeing anything in the reference guide like that page. ",
