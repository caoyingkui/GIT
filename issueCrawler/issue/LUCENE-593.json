The field passed on to the constructor should be internald. And then all is good.\n\n  public LuceneDictionary(IndexReader reader, String field) \n{\n    this.reader = reader;\n    this.field = field;\n    this.field.intern();\n  } ",

However, if the iterator is only supposed to be used internally by the spell-checking code, why is it public at all?\nAd 2)\n\tGREAT! That also provides the workaround until this patch can be applied: simply call the constructor with an interned string.\n\n ",
