I'm not sure if there is anything built-in that is long enough to matter - it comes into play if, for example, if you want to alternate fully qualified class names per round.\n\nMy original workaround was to simply pad the column name - but it was ugly and had it's limitations, so I instead made some modifications to the formatting classes.
