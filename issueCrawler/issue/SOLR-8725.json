To summarize, there were some issues with cores becoming inaccessible after being renamed, when the new name contained quirky characters.  When enforcement was put in, the regex as written to match existing Solr \"recommendations\", which suggest that identifiers should only contain alphanumerics, periods, and underscores.\n\nThere's been some pushback on treating hyphens as invalid, particularly on SOLR-8110, and on SOLR-8642.  I think the current consensus is that this behavior will be changed in SOLR-8110. ",

I think they mention specifically what characters are allowed in a valid identifier.  If the regex is changing, the messages should probably be updated also.  (Might make sense to pull the message into a single constant that lives in SolrIdentifierValidator too, but maybe it doesn't, I'd have to look.)\n\nHappy to update the patch myself with those changes if you want.  Wanted to check first though; didn't want to step on your toes if there's a reason you didn't do it. ",
