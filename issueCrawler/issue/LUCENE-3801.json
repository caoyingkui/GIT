    "description": "Not sure we should do this, it costs 5-10% performance for WFSTSuggester.\nBut maybe we can optimize something here, or maybe its just no big deal to us.\n\nBecause in general, this could be pretty powerful, e.g. if you needed to store \nsome custom stuff in the suggester, you could use pairoutputs, or whatever.\n\nAnd the possibility we might need shortestPaths for other cool things... at the\nleast I just wanted to have the patch up here.\n\nI haven't tested this on pairoutputs... but i've tested it with e.g. FloatOutputs\nand other things and it works fine.\n\nI tried to minimize the generics violations, there is only 1 (cannot create generic array).",

So 200,000-210,000QPS compared to 220,000QPS really cannot matter!\n\nIf the benchmark can really satisfy 50000 queries in 220 ms, thats no 226QPS!\n\nI'll come back with a PairOutputs test in a bit to confirm the functionality but I'm not going to worry\nabout 5%/10% performance here, thats crazy.

The simple one passes (somehow), but the random one triggers an assertion in shortestPaths\n\nBasically the issue is that the original impl has an optimization: when you pick some minimum path (say 5), you know there is sequence of all zeros leading to some final state, otherwise its not actually the minimum \n\nThe code takes advantage of this and (fortunately) asserts that it finds this path of all NO_OUTPUTs. \n\nThe problem is if you have a PairOutputs(weight,output), its only NO_OUTPUT if both weight and output are also NO_OUTPUT, but this only holds true for the weight... the output has its own separately pushed minimums that don't necessarily correspond...\n ",
