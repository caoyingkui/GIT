    "description": "SpatialOperation (which I wish was named SpatialPredicate) is a bunch of predicates \u2013 methods that return true/false based on a pair of shapes.  Some of them don't seem to be defined in a way consistent with their definitions on ESRI's site:\nhttp://edndoc.esri.com/arcsde/9.1/general_topics/understand_spatial_relations.htm  (which is linked as a reference, and is in turn equivalent to OGC spec definitions, I believe).\n\nProblems:\n\n\tthe definitions make no mention of needing to have area or not, yet some of our predicates are defined as to require area on either the indexed or query shape.\n\tthe definitions make a distinction of the boundary of a shape, yet in Lucene-spatial, there is none.  That suggests our predicates are wrongly chosen since there are official predicates that are boundary-neutral \u2013 namely \"Covers\" and \"CoveredBy\" in lieu of Contains and Within, respectively.  If we don't rename our predicates, we should at least support the correct predicates names!\n\tOverlaps appears totally wrong. It should be defined as indexedShape.relate(queryShape) == Intersects  (and thus not Within or Contains or Disjoint).  It's presently defined as the same as Intersects plus the query shape needing area.",

Not seen here is a change to BBoxStrategy to disavow it's support for Overlaps.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not sure \"queryNeedsArea\" and \"targetNeedsArea\" is needed or has correct values.  Same for scoreIsMeaningful.  Can't this thing be a simple enum?  Could you take a look Ryan McKinley? ",

            "content": "The attached patch removes the \"needs area\" and \"score is meaningful\" notions from SpatialOperation.\n\nI also added aliases to the various predicates to align with the standard names.  Ryan, why did you choose the non-standard names?  E.g. why did you choose \"IsEqualTo\" when \"Equals\" is the standard name?  And why the BBoxIntersects and BBoxWithin predicates which I'm not aware we use and are also non-standard and seem better addressed via other ways (e.g. some sort of function one adds that bbox'es a shape).
