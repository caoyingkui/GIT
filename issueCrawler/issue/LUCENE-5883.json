    "description": "Since LUCENE-5711, MergePolicy is no longer wired to an IndexWriter instance. Therefore it can be moved to be a live setting on IndexWriter, which will allow apps to plug-in an MP on a live IW instance, without closing/reopening the writer. See for example LUCENE-5526 - instead of adding MP to forceMerge, apps could change the MP before calling forceMerge, with e.g. an UpgradeIndexMergePolicy.\n\nI think we can also make MergeScheduler a live setting, though I currently don't see the benefits of doing that, so I'd rather not touch it now.",

            "content": "BTW, the way I implemented it is that top-level API methods grab the current MergePolicy on the IWC and pass it down to methods like mergeMiddle(), commitInternal() etc., so that if the MP changes in the middle, nothing weird happens. E.g. if a merge was registered, but midway the MP changes and its CFS settings are different ... I think it's safer and it's not important to have THE most recent MP affect already registered merges.

I still would like to pass a MergePolicy to forceMerge, just for the forced merging.\n\nOn the other hand, you can change merge policy, forceMerge() without waiting, and change back. This is possible, because the merge policy does not change for running merges... ",
