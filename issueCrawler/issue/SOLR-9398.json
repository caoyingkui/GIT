    "description": "When merging is happening, particularly if it's an optimize, a deleteByQuery update request will block until the merge is complete.  Any other change to the index is also blocked by the delete.\n\nIf a query with fl set to the uniqueKey is made, then the list of IDs received from that query is submitted as a delete by ID, then there's no problem.  This suggests that it is probably possible to fix this.\n\nI know for sure that this affects 5.3.2, and I think it likely affects all 6.x versions too.  I don't have any large indexes on anything newer than 5.3.2.",
