    "description": "Spinoff of LUCENE-1536.\n\nIn LUCENE-1536, Uwe suggested using FilteredQuery under-the-hood to implement filtered search.\n\nBut this query is inefficient, it does a per-document multiplication (wrapped.score() * boost()).\n\nInstead, it should just pass the boost down in its weight, like BooleanQuery does to avoid this per-document multiply.",
