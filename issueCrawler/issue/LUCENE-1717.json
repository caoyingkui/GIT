Once you hit the upper bound BufferedDeletes should be flushed to disc by calling IndexWriter#flush(). This can happend with either a add or a delete.

Once IndexWriter#doFlushInternal is executed the DocWriter pushes deletes from deletesInRam to deletesFlushed. Shouldn't this call deletesInRam#clear() to free the memory in this instance of BufferedDeletes. That could at least help a bit if I do not miss anything important.\n ",

BufferedDeletes#terms stores <Term, Num> and BufferedDeletes#queries stores <Query, Num> in both cases the value part is easy to account while especially for query the memory consumption is hard to guess similarly the amount of memory a Term takes.\n\nOn the other hand I would like to have a notion of memory consumption os BufferedDeletes but the IndexWriters#setRAMBufferSizeMB javaDoc clearly says that this does not include the memory used by buffered deletes. I would rather tend to leave it as it is and make it clear in javadoc / wiki that setMaxBufferedDeleteTerms is the way to go if you run into memory problems. Feels quite ambiguous to estimate the memory of buffered deletes.\n\nI think is a good default once we fix the accounting in IndexWriter to properly account for buffered delete's RAM usage.\nis there already an issue to fix the RAM usage?
