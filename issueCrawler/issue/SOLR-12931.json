After spending a couple of minutes I figured this has to do with tests around ExitableDirectoryReader\n\nLet's use ExitableDirectoryReader as the feature in context that we wanted to test - We wrote a test for single core and then a cloud test. I think this is a typical pattern where the single core test can be more exhaustive, but we want to write a cloud test to make sure it works in the distributed case as well\n\nBoth are integration tests.\n\nDelayingSearchComponent is the helper class and in the ( org.apache.solr.search ) package\n CloudExitableDirectoryReaderTest is the test that uses this and is in the ( org.apache.solr.cloud ) package\n ExitableDirectoryReaderTest is the single core test for this in the ( org.apache.solr.core ) package\n\nProposing that we move these three classes to it's own package as a first pass.\n When we make a clear distinction of mock vs integration tests we could move this package under integration ",
