    "description": "I think, long ago, this class was abused for numeric range searching, if you converted your numeric terms into text terms \"carefully\", but we now have dimensional points for that, and I think otherwise this query class is quite dangerous: you can easily accidentally make a very costly query.\n\nFurthermore, the common use cases for multi-term queries are already covered by other classes (PrefixQuery, WildcardQuery, FuzzyQuery).",
