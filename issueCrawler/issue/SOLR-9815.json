    "description": "There have been some excellent logging fixes in 6.3 (http://www.cominvent.com/2016/11/07/solr-logging-just-got-better/).  However now, by default, Solr is logging a great deal of garbage collection information.\n\nIt seems that this logging is excessive, can we make the default logging to not be verbose?\n\nFor linux/mac setting GC_LOG_OPTS=\"\" in solr.in.sh seems to work around the issue, but looking at solr.cmd I don't think that will work for windows.",

Another parameter we could re-visit is how much GC logs we save by default. With '-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=9' '-XX:GCLogFileSize=20M' we keep 200Mb of logs. Is this ok, or too little for typical debugging purposes? \n\nMy experience from a few customers with performance problems is that it is nice to be able to run gvciew on the logs, and I've been able to identify GC issues a few times through this method. As far as I can remember there has been enough history in the logs. Could be that there would have been enough info in non-verbose logs as well...\n\nPlease chime in, or I'll close this next week. ",
