    "description": "Some of the tests are relying on empty stder.\nThis is very inconvenient for machines using various configurations on various JVMs.\n\nEg:\nJAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='-XX:+UseShenandoahGC '\nexport JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS\n\nthen any jvm invocation (even java -version) prints to stderr\n/usr/bin/java -version\nPicked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -XX:+UseShenandoahGC  \n\nThere are much more cases when stderr is used for smilar informatio, and lucene testsuite should be readdy for this.\n\nMaybe for start just remove all lines staring by \"Picked up\" for openjdk?-)",
