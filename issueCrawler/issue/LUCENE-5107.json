This allows to still read files written by 4.4 and before with unicode-escapes (the Reader load(Reader) method decodes unicode-escaped, too). In fact, files written by the InputStream API are US-ASCII only, with everything >127 escaped (see src.zip) - so can also be loaded by an UTF-8 decoder, so the change breaks no existing files. ",
