(why allowing to create \n  a multi-reader with no readers at all?)\n\n\n ",

I think the MultiReader(IndexReader[]) constructor should allways call super(null) \u2013  anyone currently relying on MultiReader.directory() it to return the directory of the \"first\" IndexReader should be able to easily change their code.  if we want to make it really easy we could provide a MultiReader.getSubReader(int n) method.

If rrr.isCurrent() throws unsupported, the application needs to question recursively. \n\nI am not aware of such an application, so you could argue this is only theoretic, still it demonstrates a strength of Lucene.  Also, here too, as argued above, even if the answer is false (not current), the application would need to apply the same recursive logic to reopen the non-current reader and reconstruct the multi-reader. \n\nSo I agree it is valid to throw unsupported.\n\nJust that it feels a bit uncomfortable to throw unsupported for existing API of a method with well defined meaning that is quite easy to implement (relying on that anyhow it was never implemented correctly).
