Specifically, if machine #1 has\njust removed file \"segments_n\" and shortly thereafer machine #2 does a\ndir listing, it's possible (likely?) that the dir listing will still\nshow that segments_n exists.\n\nI think the fix is simple: catch the FNFE and just handle it as if the\nsegments_n does not in fact exist.",
