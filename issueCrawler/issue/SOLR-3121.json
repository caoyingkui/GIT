The old structure would go out and do the detailed information-gathering and then use it later, overloading numTerms all over the place. The patch just tries to get the detailed info when it should. It does require the fl field to get detailed info at any time though.\n\nYour patch changed the way we request fields, which made it possible to untangle the handler itself.\n\nTake a look and let me know.\n\nThis re-structuring probably does NOT play nice with the old admin UI though, we really need to decide whether to stop worrying about the old UI and just cut over to this one. I know the new UI doesn't deal with cloud leaf-node expansion yet, see SOLR-3116.\n\nAnd it seems like this handles SOLR-3094 too. "

            "content": "Small change that restores the old Admin UI behavior.\n\nNOTE: The old UI behavior is going to be slow for large indexes since it does the enumeration of all the fields when you click \"schema browser\". The right fix is to incorporate the new parameters in \"the right place\" in the old admin UI, but at least this doesn't change the old behavior, it just doesn't make it as nice as the new. "

            "content": "bq: I think we can even remove the old schema browser (linking to the new one) until we can get rid of the old one entirely\n\nDoesn't this happen already? If I enter http://localhost:8983/ I go straight to the new UI, although it does have a link to the old UI and the old URL goes straight to the old Admin UI.\n\nBut yeah, it seems that cutting over to the new UI and letting the old one fade away (or just remove it) is what should be done. The problem is, though, that the new code is kind of intimidating if you're not fluent in js/jquery, but I suppose it's just a matter of getting used to it.\n\nAnd SOLR-3116 is a known issue. I expect that SolrCloud will get a lot of traffic when 4.0 is released, so this seems critical if we're to really cut over.\n\nAnyway, I'll commit this patch today sometime unless someone beats me to it.
