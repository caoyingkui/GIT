    "description": "From a message to solr-users (Noble Paul suggested I create an issue):\n\nI have a data-config.xml that is structured in the following fashion:\n\n<document>\n  <entity name=\"parent\" query=\"fullParentQuery\" deltaImportQuery=\"deltaParentImportQuery\" deltaQuery=\"deltaParentQuery\">\n     <entity name=\"child\" query=\"fullChildQuery\" deltaImportQuery=\"deltaChildImportQuery\" />\n  </entity>\n</document>\n\nIs the deltaImportQuery attribute even allowed on the child entity? The behavior I'm seeing is that when I issue a delta-import command, Solr uses the deltaParentImportQuery and deltaParentQuery from the parent entity but the fullChildQuery from the child entity. I was hoping it would use the deltaChildImportQuery on the child entity, if it exists, to figure out what data to use in the case of a delta-import.",
