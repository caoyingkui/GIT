    "description": "The \"key\" parameter that is used for aliasing output is very helpful in simplifying the readability of complex facets.  However it doesn't seem that this same alias can be used when configuring facets of individual fields.  The following example that does not use the key parameter works fine under 1.4.1:\n\nrows=0&q=:+NOT+customers.blocked:1&facet=true&f.customers_name.facet.mincount=2&facet.field=customers_name\n\n<lst name=\"customers_name\">\n  <int name=\"jone\">2</int>\n</lst>\n\nThe example below also works and does use the key parameter, however note that we're still using the original field name when referring to f.customers_name.facet.mincount:\n\nrows=0&q=:+NOT+customers.blocked:1&facet=true&f.customers_name.facet.mincount=2&facet.field=\n{!key=alt_name}customers_name\n\n<lst name=\"customers_name\">\n  <int name=\"jone\">2</int>\n</lst>\n\nThe final example below does not work.  It uses the alias established by the key parameter to configure the mincount setting for the customers_name field.\n\nrows=0&q=:+NOT+customers.blocked:1&facet=true&f.alt_name.facet.mincount=2&facet.field={!key=alt_name}\ncustomers_name\n\n<lst name=\"alt_name\">\n  <int name=\"jone\">2</int>\n  <int name=\"tim\">1</int>\n  <int name=\"sami\">0</int>\n</lst>\n\nThis is a trivial example.  The behavior becomes much more important when talking about facet queries.",
