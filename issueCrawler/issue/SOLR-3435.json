    "description": "StatsComponents stats.facet parameter doesn't support SimpleFacetParameters params like facet.mincount, facet.limit, etc. Moreover it'll always create Field Value Facets. Range Facets aren't possible.\n\nVery useful to calculate the sum of a field for each month/day/etc (using range facets) or to limit the results with facet.limit.\n\u2014\nNew users interested in mixing stats & facets are encouraged to ignore the stats.facet param and instead combine\nstats.field with facet.pivot to achieve similar results more efficiently...\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Stats+Component#TheStatsComponent-TheStatsComponentandFaceting",
