    "description": "Today, when you use multiple threads to concurrently index, Lucene\nknows the effective order that those operations were applied to the\nindex, but doesn't return that information back to you.\n\nBut this is important to know, if you want to build a reliable search\nAPI on top of Lucene.  Combined with the recently added NRT\nreplication (LUCENE-5438) it can be a strong basis for an efficient\ndistributed search API.\n\nI think we should return this information, since we already have it,\nand since it could simplify servers (ES/Solr) on top of Lucene:\n\n\n\tThey would not require locking preventing the same id from being\n    indexed concurrently since they could instead check the returned\n    sequence number to know which update \"won\", for features like\n    \"realtime get\".  (Locking is probably still needed for features\n    like optimistic concurrency).\n\n\n\n\n\tWhen re-applying operations from a prior commit point, e.g. on\n    recovering after a crash from a transaction log, they can know\n    exactly which operations made it into the commit and which did\n    not, and replay only the truly missing operations.\n\n\n\nNot returning this just hurts people who try to build servers on top\nwith clear semantics on crashing/recovering ... I also struggled with\nthis when building a simple \"server wrapper\" on top of Lucene\n(LUCENE-5376).",

I've resolved all nocommits, and created some\nfun tests with threads updating the same doc at once, doing concurrent\ncommits, and verifying what the sequence numbers claim turns out to be\ntrue.\n\nThe changes are relatively minor: IW already \"knows\" the order that\noperations were applied, but these methods return void today and\nthis changes them to return long instead.  Callers who don't\ncare can just ignore the returned long.\n\nIt also lets us remove the wrapper class TrackingIndexWriter which\nwas doing basically the same thing (returning a long for each op) but\nwith weaker guarantees.\n\nThese sequence numbers are fleeting, not saved into commit points,\netc., and only useful within one IW instance (they reset back to 1 on\nthe next IW instance).\n\nI'll build an applyable patch and post here ...
