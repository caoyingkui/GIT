    "description": "The LoadAdminUIServlet class loads up, and serves back, \"admin.html\", meaning it cannot be used in its current state to serve up the new admin UI.\n\nAn update is needed to this class to make it serve back whatever html file was requested in the URL. There will, likely, only ever be two of them mentioned in web.xml, but it would be really useful for changes to web.xml not to require Java code changes also.\n\nI'm hoping that someone with an up-and-running Java coding setup can make this pretty trivial tweak. Any volunteers?",

            "content": "To add a little more detail:\n\nThe original admin UI is rendered by admin.html. web.xml causes this to be served by the o.a.s.servlet.LoadAdminUIServlet, which does a few things like replacing ${version} tags and setting anti-clickjacking headers.\n\nTherefore, we need to also use this servlet to serve index.html, which is the new UI.\n\nHowever, this servlet includes this line:\n\nInputStream in = getServletContext().getResourceAsStream(\"/admin.html\");\n\nThis change is trivial - we just need to get from the request the actual URL that was requested, rather than hardwired, and load that filename from disk. Then I can add index.html to web.xml, and then we can make the new UI default in trunk. ",
