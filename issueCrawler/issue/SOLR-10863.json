    "description": "The theme I used as the basis of our online version included a feed.xml file, but in our context it doesn't make a ton of sense: \n\n\n\tEvery time we do a build, all the files are generated even if they've had no changes.\n\tThe publication date on the files makes them unique every build - IOW, the list of \"changed\" files is all files.\n\tIt only lists 10 files, when there are nearly 200 of them.\n\n\n\nIt's also unlikely that we'll be updating pages all that regularly, so subscribing to a feed isn't going to deliver anything to users.\n\nSo, I'll take that out, which I should have done a while ago - it just slipped my mind.",
