    "description": "If I create a collection with implicit routing and, say, maxShardsPerNode=3, then start creating shards, when I create the 4th shard I get an error. So far so good. The error is very misleading though, see below.\n\nSaw this on a degenerate case of a single Solr instance, not sure if you get the same error on a multi-node cluster.\n\n<str name=\"Operation createshard caused exception:\">\n...... Cannot create collection eoe. No live Solr-instances\n</str>\n<lst name=\"exception\">\n<str name=\"msg\">Cannot create collection eoe. No live Solr-instances</str>\n<int name=\"rspCode\">400</int>\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nRelated question is I don't think there's a graceful way to increase maxShardsPerNode after the collection is created.",
