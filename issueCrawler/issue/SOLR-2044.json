    "description": "When hosting SOLR at Amazon there is an issue with load balancing and replication. This is especially useful when you are using multiple slaves behind\nthe load balancer and a MASTER SOLR box. The Load Balancer at Amazon has no way of knowing that each SLAVE has data from the MASTER replicated. As soon as the instance starts, \nAmazon starts sending requests to the Slaves. You need to have the Slave running in order to get the files from the Master.\n\nThe solution is to add a ping.jsp page that Amazon hits on the Slave Tomcat/Jetty instances. The ping.jsp checks all cores to make sure they all have data, otherwise it returns a non-200 values which signals Amazon\nto not send requests to the Slaves.\n\nPut this into your solr.war file as /admin/replication/ping.jsp",
