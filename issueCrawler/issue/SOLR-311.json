Otherwise, it results in the following error on windows command line:\n\n(sample DOS window FAILS)\nC:\\downloads\\temp\\apache-solr-1.2.0\\example\\exampledocs>java -Ddata=args -jar post.jar '<delete><query>name:DDR</query></delete>'\n< was unexpected at this time.\n\n(sample DOS window WORKS)\nC:\\downloads\\temp\\apache-solr-1.2.0\\example\\exampledocs>java -Ddata=args -jar post.jar \"<delete><query>name:DDR</query></delete>\"\nSimplePostTool: version 1.2\nSimplePostTool: WARNING: Make sure your XML documents are encoded in UTF-8, other encodings are not currently supported\nSimplePostTool: POSTing args to http://localhost:8983/solr/update..\nSimplePostTool: COMMITting Solr index changes..\n\nAs demonstrated double quotes works with windows.  I also tested double quotes in cygwin, and it should presumably work for linux/UNIX as well.\n\nI started to do a patch, but I see there are three locations where updates might need to be made and I wasn't sure how PDF files were generated, so here's the list of effected source files:\n\nsite/tutorial.html\nsite/tutorial.pdf\nsrc/site/src/documentation/content/xdocs/tutorial.xml",
