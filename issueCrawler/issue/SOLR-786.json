    "description": "I needed to change some of the default behaviour of the DismaxQParser, so as opposed to infecting the solr codebase with our custom behaviour, I wanted to be able to subclass the DismaxQParser and change only what we wanted to change. \n\nHere I submit a patch that allows for such subclassing. The change that is done to the code base in the following steps:\n\n1. refactor in the DismaxQParser.parse() method to \n    addMainQuery(query, solrParams);\n    addBoostQuery(query, solrParams);\n    addBoostFunctions(query, solrParams); \n\n2. refactor the addMainQuery() method to use \n    getUserQuery(userQuery, up, solrParams)\n    getAlternateUserQuery(solrParams)\n    getPhraseQuery(userQuery, pp) \n\n3. move the DismaxQParser to the top-level to make it public (and allow subclassing)\n\nAfter applying this change I can to as follows:\n1. write my own QParserPlugin to return a subclass of the DismaxQParser \n2. in this subclass I override the the methods I need, in my case the getUserQuery() method.\n3. add this plugin to the solrconfig.xml and use it\n\nthe patch is done against the Solr svn trunk",
