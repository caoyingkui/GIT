    "description": "When using facet.threads, SimpleFacets can return the wrong results when using facet.prefix multiple times on the same field.\n\nThe problem is that SimpleFacets essentially stores the prefix value in a global variable, rather than passing the current prefix value into the Callable. So, the prefix value that is used when getting the term counts is whichever one was the last one parsed.\n\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\n\n\tCreate a document with a string field named \"myFieldName\" and value \"foo\"\n\tCreate another document with a string field named \"myFieldName\" and value \"bar\"\n\tRun this query: \n\nq=*:*&rows=0&facet=true&facet.field={!key=key1 facet.prefix=foo}myFieldName&facet.field={!key=key2 facet.prefix=bar}myFieldName&facet.threads=1\n\n\n\n\nEXPECTED:\n\n<lst name=\"facet_fields\">\n  <lst name=\"key1\">\n    <int name=\"foo\">1</int>\n  </lst>\n  <lst name=\"key2\">\n    <int name=\"bar\">1</int>\n  </lst>\n</lst>\n\n\nACTUAL:\n\n<lst name=\"facet_fields\">\n  <lst name=\"key1\">\n    <int name=\"bar\">1</int>\n  </lst>\n  <lst name=\"key2\">\n    <int name=\"bar\">1</int>\n  </lst>\n</lst>\n\n\nI'm using 4.9, but I think this affects all versions.\n\nA user previously reported this here:\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201405.mbox/%3CBAY169-W52CEF09187A88286DE5417D5270@phx.gbl%3E\n\nI think this affects parameters other than facet.prefix, but I have not tried that yet.",

I've removed the mutable state from SimpleFacets and changed the parsedParams() method to return an instance of a new static inner class called ParsedParams.  This ParsedParams instance is then passed around the the various methods.\n\nIt's not the cleanest fix but it is working so far for me.  A better fix probably involves a larger refactoring of SimpleFacets. ",
