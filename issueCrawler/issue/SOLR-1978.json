    "description": "There is a need for a mapping filter as a counterpart for the MappingCharFilterFactory, but designed to run after tokenization. It should read the same config file format as the MappingCharFilterFactory does.\n\nThis will be a more generic approach to accent normalization than the ISOLatin1AccentFilterFactory which is hard coded.\n\nThe reason why we need it as a TokenFilter is that sometimes the normalization needs to happen far down in the analysis chain, because previous filters rely on the original value of the token, such as stemming, synonyms or other dictionary lookups.\n\nThis patch would require a MappingTokenFilter in Lucene as well.",
