    "description": "The distance query for Geo3DPoint currently uses the GeoStandardCircle which is only accurate when the PlanetModel is a sphere. \n\nIn LUCENE-7970. a new implementation called GeoExactCircle was added that models an exact circle, even when the planet model is not a sphere. Because Geo3DPoint is using WGS84 planet model,  we should be using this implementation instead. The downside is that this implementation will be slightly slower.",
