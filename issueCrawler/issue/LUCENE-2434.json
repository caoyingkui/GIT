    "description": "(Please note that the feature described in LUCENE-2425 is required reading for this issue.) \n\nThe mirroring split policy builds on the remoting split policy, treating each sub-index as a mirror of the super-index (upon which the split writer is built). The motivation for this policy is to allow a given index to be available on multiple nodes (that define a cluster), which helps to load-balance search requests across the nodes in that cluster, not to mention implement fail-over for index searchers.\n\nUnlike other mirroring solutions for Lucene, this approach gives users the ability to (a) pick and choose the types of directories underlying the mirror, and (b) add/remove mirrors on the fly. However, note that the latter capability has not yet been implemented, although it will be soon.",
