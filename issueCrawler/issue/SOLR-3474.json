My worry is that you put your browser on that page to make sure everything is happy, and oh a node goes down and everything still looks green an hour later - until you hit refresh...\n\nEvery 10 seconds sounds reasonable to me.

When you have a small 2-3 node cluster, it is displayed on a fraction of the available space, and for my conference audience they could not read the text on the nodes. It would be great that if on every refresh, you also calculate optimal zoom factor. "
