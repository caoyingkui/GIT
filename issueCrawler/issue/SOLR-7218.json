    "description": "A ConstantScoreQuery is like a boosted query, but it produces the same score for every document that matches the query. The score produced is equal to the query boost. The ^= operator is used to turn any query clause into a ConstantScoreQuery.\n\nConstant Score Query Examples:\n\n+color:blue^=1 text:shoes\n(inStock:true text:heliosearch)^=100 native code faceting\n\n\n\nSyntax rational: since boosting (multiplication) is term^value, the syntax for having a constant score can be term^=value",
