    "description": "QueryComponent is, after all this time, still not extendable. Overriding a simple method is mostly impossible due to members being private or usage of non-public classes. Copying all code to an external class is also not going to work because of this. This patch finally allows overriding QueryComponent methods such as createMainQuery and mergeIds.",

I tweaked your patch a little locally: I found one extra spot that should call the getResponseDocs() method vs the direct field... and one rename you did from \"private\" to \"protected\" was in a comment that didn't make sense to rename... and I optimized some imports.  I'll be committing shortly.\n\nThanks for contributing Markus! ",
