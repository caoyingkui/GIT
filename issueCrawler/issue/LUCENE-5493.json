So someone should just be doing:\n\nSort sort = new Sort(new SortField(\"field1\", SortField.Type.DOUBLE), new SortField(....));\niwc.setMergePolicy(mp, new SortingMergePolicy(sort));\n\n\n\nThis would let people be able to sort in reverse, by doubles/floats, by a combination of fields, expressions, whatever.

SortingMP and EarlyTerminatingSortingCollector would just take Sort directly.\n\nBlockJoinSorter needs to be cutover to a regular comparator. And in suggest/ there is a custom comparator... that i think doesnt need to be custom and is just sorting on a dv field. ",
