    "description": "There is a case when leader sends an update to replica but met SocketException: broken pipe ( HttpPartitionTest ), the leader treat this exception as others SocketException and put replica into LIR mode. But this exception means an existing connection between leader and replica is closed on one side. I think we should handle this exception in a different way ( ex: reconnect ) so leader won't blindly put replica into LIR even when the connection between leader and replica is healthy.",
