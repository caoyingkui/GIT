    "description": "We have a single core and use faceting to search documents. When we started to use multi select faceting we noticed, that results do not match with the real data in the core.\n\nFor example, we make this simple query:\n\nq=*:*\nrows=0\nfacet=true\nfacet.limit=5\nfacet.field=file_type\n\n\n\nCorresponding URL is http://localhost:8983/.../select?q=*%3A*&rows=0&wt=json&indent=true&facet=true&facet.limit=5&facet.field=file_type\n\nWe get the following results:\n\n{\n  \"responseHeader\": {\n    \"status\": 0,\n    \"QTime\": 42\n  },\n  \"response\": {\n    \"numFound\": 1240067,\n    \"start\": 0,\n    \"docs\": []\n  },\n  \"facet_counts\": {\n    \"facet_queries\": {},\n    \"facet_fields\": {\n      \"file_type\": [\n        \"5\",\n        1073053,\n        \"3\",\n        51078,\n        \"7\",\n        41956,\n        \"10\",\n        16121,\n        \"12\",\n        12585\n      ]\n    },\n    \"facet_dates\": {},\n    \"facet_ranges\": {},\n    \"facet_intervals\": {},\n    \"facet_heatmaps\": {}\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhen we add a filter by file_type:\n\nq=*:*\nfq=file_type:3\nrows=0\nfacet=true\nfacet.limit=5\nfacet.field=file_type\n\n\n\nCorresponding URL is http://localhost:8983/.../select?q=*%3A*&fq=file_type%3A3&rows=0&wt=json&indent=true&facet=true&facet.limit=5&facet.field=file_type\n\nthen we get nonzero count only for the filtered value:\n\n{\n  \"responseHeader\": {\n    \"status\": 0,\n    \"QTime\": 5\n  },\n  \"response\": {\n    \"numFound\": 51078,\n    \"start\": 0,\n    \"docs\": []\n  },\n  \"facet_counts\": {\n    \"facet_queries\": {},\n    \"facet_fields\": {\n      \"file_type\": [\n        \"3\",\n        51078,\n        \"1\",\n        0,\n        \"4\",\n        0,\n        \"5\",\n        0,\n        \"7\",\n        0\n      ]\n    },\n    \"facet_dates\": {},\n    \"facet_ranges\": {},\n    \"facet_intervals\": {},\n    \"facet_heatmaps\": {}\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBut we want to have multi select faceting by file_type, so we exclude the filter from faceting:\n\nq=*:*\nfq={!tag=ft}file_type:3\nrows=0\nfacet=true\nfacet.limit=5\nfacet.field={!ex=ft}file_type\n\n\n\nCorresponding URL is {{http://localhost:8983/.../select?q=*%3A*&fq=%7B!tag%3Dft%7Dfile_type%3A3&rows=0&wt=json&indent=true&facet=true&facet.limit=5&facet.field=\n{!ex=ft}\nfile_type}}\n\nBut results contain incorrect values for all available file_type values. All counts are greater than they were before we added the filter:\n\n{\n  \"responseHeader\": {\n    \"status\": 0,\n    \"QTime\": 38\n  },\n  \"response\": {\n    \"numFound\": 51078,\n    \"start\": 0,\n    \"docs\": []\n  },\n  \"facet_counts\": {\n    \"facet_queries\": {},\n    \"facet_fields\": {\n      \"file_type\": [\n        \"5\",\n        1073146,\n        \"3\",\n        66705,\n        \"7\",\n        42202,\n        \"10\",\n        16903,\n        \"12\",\n        12710\n      ]\n    },\n    \"facet_dates\": {},\n    \"facet_ranges\": {},\n    \"facet_intervals\": {},\n    \"facet_heatmaps\": {}\n  }\n}\n\n\nWe expect multi select facet counts to be exactly the same as without filters. Before we added the filter by file_type we saw that there are only 51078 documents with file_type=3. But when we add the filter and exclude it from the faceting, Solr tells us about 66705 documents with file_type=3 while the numFound is still 51078.",

            "content": "While helping somebody with another issue - SOLR-8496 - the evidence is suggesting that adding multi-select causes deleted documents to be counted.  I'm betting that you have about 15000 deleted documents in the index with a file_type of 3.\n\nAre you in a position where you can optimize this index and try again?  If optimizing fixes the problem, then this issue and SOLR-8496 probably have the same root cause.\n\nAdding docValues to the field and reindexing might also fix the problem. ",

            "content": " Hi, we noticed that these erroneous values (that are greater than the real count) are exactly the same as the values, that can be found in the Solr Admin UI in the \"Schema Browser\" tab. When you select your core in the dropdown and go to the \"Schema Browser\" tab, then select document field (file_type in our case) and press \"Load Term Info\" button, you will see exactly the same values, that are returned by multi select facets.\n\nAnd you are right that optimizing the core updates these counts to be correct.\n\nBut using docValues does not help. We use EmbeddedSolrCore to run some junit tests, and one of the test fails because of this problem, and changing the schema to use docValues does not help. Is there any way to programmatically update these counts, maybe to drop the caches? Or is there any trick that are necessary to make docValues fix this problem? ",

It's the same problem that's happening on SOLR-8496.\n\nIt's not likely to be a problem with caches.  There is a problem in the facet code, a problem that affects facets using both indexed data and docValues data. ",
