    "description": "I installed solr cluster using version 4.1.0 and configuration we have for 4.0.0 and instantly saw the difference: in the cloud admin page both graphs are not displayed correctly in Google Chrome.\n\nThe common graph is not displayed at all and the radial graph doesn't show all vertices and edges. (See screenshots attached).\n\nThere are no errors in Javascript console though.\n\nBoth graphs work perfectly well in Firefox 18. And the work in Chrome when we use solr 4.0.0.",
