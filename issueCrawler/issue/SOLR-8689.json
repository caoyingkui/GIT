I asked on the Hotspot Mailing List:\nhttp://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-dev/2017-August/027962.html\n\n\nI am currently adapting Apache Solr's startup scripts for Java 9. Linux was already done at the beginning of this year and works perfectly, but Windows brings some problems. I already fixed version number parsing, but I stumbled on the following: In the Windows \".cmd\" shell script it uses the following to enable Garbage collection logging to a separate file, if Java 9 is detected:\n    set GC_LOG_OPTS=\"-Xlog:gc*:file=Unable to render embedded object: File (SOLR_LOGS_DIR) not found.\\solr_gc.log:time,uptime:filecount=9,filesize=20000\"\n\nThe problem is now that \"Unable to render embedded object: File (SOLR_LOGS_DIR) not found.\" is already expanded to an absolute Windows Path by the shell and therefore starts with \"C:\\\". The problem is now the colon, which breaks the log parsing. When Java 9 starts it exits with the following parsing error:\nInvalid -Xlog option '-Xlog:gc*:file=C:\\Users\\Uwe Schindler\\Projects\\lucene\\trunk-lusolr1\\solr\\server\\logs\\solr_gc.log:time,uptime:filecount=9,filesize=20000'\n\nIf I replace with a simple file name, without path/drive letter it works. How to escape the colon in the drive letter correctly, to me this looks like a bummer? ",

The GC_LOG_OPTS used as it was before the change on Java <= 8, but for Java 9 it is ignored. I have no better idea how to do this. IMHO, this is better than not working at all! I added documentation for this.\n\nDoes anybody have a better idea or knows how to do the same magic regex replcaments like in the linux shell script? Is the current approach acceptable, Hoss Man? ",

We can release note that solr.cmd startup script doesn't work in that permutation and focus on fixing later (if anyone is really hardcore about using solr + windows + jdk9 they can probably work around using the solr.cmd script)\n\nThe GC_LOG_OPTS used as it was before the change on Java <= 8, but for Java 9 it is ignored. I have no better idea how to do this. IMHO, this is better than not working at all! I added documentation for this.\n\nMy personal opinion is that it would be better to continue to support things as best we can for existing solr users who may upgrade solr w/o caring about jdk9 at all \u2013 ie: keep supporting/using GC_LOG_OPTS \u2013 but in the special in the case where they use jdk9 and try to specify a value for the GC_LOG_OPTS ... we should hard fail w/message that solr can't support GC_LOG_OPTS  when using jdk9.  \n\nI believe you said in your current patch you \"ignored\" GC_LOG_OPTS when using jdk9? ... i think that's a mistake, as existing solr users who may have already set GC_LOG_OPTS and then later upgrade to jdk9 will get confusing silently different behavior.  better to fail fast and be clear that they can't do that (unless/until we find a better solution) ",

            "content": "Patch with Hoss Man's suggestions. If somebody sets GC_LOG_OPTS on Java 9 it bails out. I also updated documentation in the solr.in.cmd file.\n\nI tested with:\n\n\tJava 8u144: Works as usual, GC_LOG_OPTS is respected if explicitely set\n\tJava 9b178: Works now by default; if you comment out the GC_LOG_OPTS it fails early. BTW, in the UNIX scripts it would also fail if somebody updates Java 8 to Java 9, because the logging options are incompatible. So we are consistent for users that have GC_LOG_OPTS configured and migrate.\n\tIBM J9 (Java 8): Works as before\n\tJava 7u90: Fails early\n\tJava 6: Fails early\n\n\n\nI think we should really commit this and maybe later improve this. It looks like I am the only active Solr committer that knows windows shell scripts a bit. IMHO, maybe we should switch to PowerShell, really! PowerShell is now installed on all supported Windows VMs, Windows 7 is out of service.\n\nHoss Man: Any complaints or do you trust me? The current state is much better than before and the added code is trivial. IMHO, we should really not release that without basic Java 9 support and some migration path.

            "content": "Hi Varun,\nthe warnings are:\n\n\tThe garbage collectors are deprecated. That's something we should investigate. Maybe it's time to switch to G1GC at some time by default.\n\tThe BufferUtils warning is caused by reflection of Jetty into JDK internals. On tests we don't see this, because we execute Java with --illegal-access=deny. By default, Java 9 allows illegal accesses. IMHO, we should maybe also deny illegal access in Solr by default through the startup scripts. Jetty can handle this, so it falls back to something that does not try to reflect into JDK internals.\n\n\n\nI think we should open a separate issue and hack the startup scripts of solr to pass \"--illegal-access=deny\" to the JVM. Interestingly, I don't see this warning on master and 7.x, but on 7.0 and 6.6, so maybe that's just an issue of older Jetty versions (9.3.14 vs. 9.3.20). ",
