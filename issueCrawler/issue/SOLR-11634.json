            "content": "Here's the calculation from CreateCollectionCmd. nodeList.size() is the number of live nodes or the number of nodes in createnodeset if specified:\n\n\n        int maxShardsAllowedToCreate = maxShardsPerNode * nodeList.size();\n        int requestedShardsToCreate = numSlices * repFactor;\n        if (maxShardsAllowedToCreate < requestedShardsToCreate) {\n             report error back\n        }\n\n\n\nSo maxShardsPerNode is more like maxReplicasPerNode. If I have a 4 node cluster and specify numShards=4&replicationFactor=10 my maxShardsPerNode must be set to 10. What? I only have 4 shards in the first place. maxShardsPerNode only really makes sense when replicationFactor=1.\n\nThat aside, I can't reconcile getting more than 2 replicas (no matter what shard they are part of) on a single node when specifying maxShardsPerNode=2, even if I do think of it as maxReplicasPerNode. How many nodes were you trying the above with? And I'm assuming you didn't have the rule bit originally.\n\nSolr doesn't really understand a machine as opposed to a JVM though. So if I have two JVMs running on the same physical machine, something like:\n\n192.168.0.1:8981\n192.168.0.1:8982\n\nthose are seen as separate live nodes and Solr would happily put one replica on each. Could that be what you were seeing?\n\nWould it be possible to attach the CLUSTERSTATUS along with the command you used to create it? something like \n\nsolr_node:port/solr/admin/collections?action=CLUSTERSTATUS&wt=json\n\nNote it's important that we see the live_nodes Znode too.
