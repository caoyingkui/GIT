I see lots of CLIENT ERROR messages in the verbose output of ant resolve for ones that fail - for some reason failing to download those other source&javadoc jars doesn't fail the build.  Conversely, I don't know why failing to download the javadoc jar for javax.activation:activation caused a build failure.\n\nI'm going to change all other ivy.xml files in the project to use default configuration mappings, and see if everything still works.

We do have some maven support, but most of the committers aren't using it and many people don't even know it's there, so it doesn't get looked at constantly.  If not for Steve Rowe, it might be neglected entirely.\n\nhttps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk/dev-tools/maven/README.maven\n\nYou may already know this: Ant is a program for managing builds, similar in a lot of ways to the \"make\" utility that is commonly used for C programs, but better optimized for java projects and configured with XML rather than a utility-specific file format.  Ivy is a program for managing and obtaining dependencies.  Ivy integrates very well with ant.  Maven does both build management and dependency management.  I have only the tiniest amount of experience with Maven, but only as a user of other people's maven builds.  I've never created a project with it. ",
