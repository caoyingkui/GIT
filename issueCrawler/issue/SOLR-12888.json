    "description": "If the schema supports it, the NestedUpdateProcessor URP should be registered automatically somehow.  The Factory for this already looks for the existence of certain special fields in the schema, so that's good.  But the URP Factory needs to be added to your chain in any of the ways we support that.  In 8.0 the user shouldn't have to do anything to their solrconfig.  \n\nWe might un-URP this and call directly somewhere.  Or perhaps we might add a special named URP chain (needn't document), defined automatically, that activates at RunURP.  Perhaps other things could be added to this in the future.",
