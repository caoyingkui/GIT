    "description": "After a misunderstanding on my part, leading to an incorrect documentation edit, Shalin Shekhar Mangar helped me understand how the commit reserve duration works.\n\nThe resulting discussion on the dev list brought up a possible problem in ReplicationHandler.  We wondered whether it might be possible for another thread to sneak in a commit point deletion in between the two statements found in the releaseCommitPointAndExtendReserve method on the DirectoryFileStream object.  If it is safe to do so, I propose reversing those two statements so the reserve extension is done before releasing the commit point.",

Within the Solr source, it is only used locally, and the number of users that are likely to write code extending that particular inner class should be very low.  Also, the inner class is private. ",

Nobody else can really use or modify this method because, as you noted, the class is inner and private.\n\nPatch looks good. Commit away! ",
