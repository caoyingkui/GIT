The  \nexception is this:  \n\nif (termEnum.term() == null) {  \n  throw new RuntimeException (\"no terms in field \" + field);  \n}  \n\nI'll attach a change suggested by Yonik Seeley that removes this exception. \n\nAlso, the if-condition above is incomplete anyway, so currently the exception \nis not always thrown (as termEnum .term() might well be != null but point to a \nterm in a different field already)",

So we\nare back in the same situation of not knowing if the query is a bug, or if it's\njust that no documents with \"foo\" indexed currently exist in the index, but may\nin the future or may have in the past.\n\nSince Lucene is a search engine rather than a search server, we should strive to\nkeep it as flexible as possible to enable that many more applications to be\nbuilt on top of it. \n\nOnce this bug is fixed, I think FieldCacheImpl.java should have only one\nRuntimeException remaining.\n ",
