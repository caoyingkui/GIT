Something like:\n\n /admin/collections?action=CLUSTERPROP&name=myCustomProperty&val=something \n\nWould fail, but something like\n\n /admin/collections?action=CLUSTERPROP&name=myCustomProperty&val=something&validate=false \n\nWould succeed. WDYT? It doesn't need to be validate=false, it could be something like acceptUnkown=true, or something else. As for the PR, the change is pretty straight forward jefferyyuan, but could you add a test too?\n\n\u00a0 ",

Something like:\nIn my opinion, the major benefit of having a well defined prefix here is ensuring a situation when a user creates a custom plugin to use internally, and that uses a property that is at some point used by someone in the community to add a totally unrelated plugin.\n\nSuch a change would require users to constantly monitor and change code when such a clash happens.\n\nI do also agree that strict enforcing/validation of known properties is useful to minimize user errors so +1 on the validation too, but that should be in addition to a pre-defined prefix for custom props.\n\nAlso, I'm not super convinced\u00a0with 'extra' and me and Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez L\u00f6bbe were talking offline and came up with a few options:\n\n\texternal.\n\tcustom.\n\tplugin.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is really a subjective thing so wouldn't want this to lead to a random debate about the right prefix keyword, but anything that highlights what it's used for should work.
