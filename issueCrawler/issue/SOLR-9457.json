    "description": "Hi,\n\nI am getting started with Apache Solr v6.2.0 on Windows 8.1.\n\n\nI downloaded the zip file and simply extracted the files. After navigating to the extracted folder, I ran command to start the node\n\n'bin\\solr start'. It started the node and I could access http://localhost:8983/solr/#/. After running the stop command 'bin\\solr stop -all', I could still access the admin page. The result of stop command shows that there are no running Solr nodes. I tried the command using the Command Prompt with Admin rights, but to no avail.\n\nAm I missing something ?",
