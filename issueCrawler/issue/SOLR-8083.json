I doubt they will be many or hard to implement. Would that work? ",

This step would just return the same output as it used to. So, really nothing changes other than the path at which this is accessed\n\tEnhance the standard APIs in such a way that the admin UI can be completely driven using them. The standard APIs will have proper JUnit tests and a well known output. The current output is driven by the UI and not the other way around.\n\n\n\nI would say we open a ticket for #2 and track it separately and the admin ui should eventually stop depending on the /admin/zookeeper end point.

It'd be great to fix those.\n\nRegarding /zookeeper, that is sufficiently fundamental a feature that we must make such a change work across both the old and new UIs. Using your new API (#2) could be done in the new UI only. ",

But whatever it is , it should be an API which is not UI centric . I see stuff like href=zookeeper?xxx which is clearly something the API should never require.
