The output reporter emits suite summaries and details (stdout/stderr + exceptions) for ONLY these tests that failed. I agree verbose stdout is fairly annoying.\n\nI'd rather not commit this in to the trunk because it'll make me go through the conflict with the branch... but if you can't live with this then go ahead (I don't like that verbose output either).
