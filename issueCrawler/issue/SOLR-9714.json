I think the script has a little problem.",

            "content": "Solr currently occupies three (four) ports on startup:\n\n\tSOLR_PORT\n\tSTOP_PORT=SOLR_PORT-1000 (jetty stop port)\n\tRMI_PORT=SOLR_PORT+10000 (jmx)\n\tzkRun port=SOLR_PORT+1000 (if started with -c without -z)\n\n\n\nToday you can (not documented) customize STOP_PORT when starting Solr, but not when stopping.\nRMI_PORT and STOP_KEY is already configurable in solr.in or env.vars, while zkRun port is not configurable.\n\nI propose the addition of SOLR_STOP_PORT in solr.in scripts and document it.\nAt the same time the install_solr_service script could get options for -j <jmx rmi port>, -t <stop port>, -k <stop key>, but perhaps instead of inventing a install-script option for every thinkable variable, we should let people supply a solr.in file -c <solr.in config file>?\n\nAnother related issue is that if you try to stop Solr with an incorrect STOP_PORT or an incorrect STOP_KEY, i.e. solr stop -k foo -p 8983 then the controlled stop through stop port/key fails, but then the process is still forcefully killed after some seconds. Should we not instead exit with message \"invalid stop port/key given\". Is not the purpose of the secret stop key to prevent people from stopping the process without the proper key? Also, the -k <key> parameter is only documented for stop, but it exists for start as well.\n ",

My latest SOLR-11161 patch proposes that the stop_solr function discovers the stop port (and the stop key) of the running process by pid, similar to how it already discovers the start/jetty port. This way then bin/solr stop -all could be used in combination with custom STOP_PORT values. ",

Another related issue is that if you try to stop Solr with an incorrect STOP_PORT or an incorrect STOP_KEY ... then the controlled stop through stop port/key fails, but then the process is still forcefully killed after some seconds. Should we not instead exit with message \"invalid stop port/key given\". ...\n\nAlong similar lines, I was wondering about support for generally opting out of forceful kills e.g. once the SOLR_STOP_WAIT time is up, perhaps one would wish to investigate (e.g. jstack the process) why the process did not exit (assuming stop port and key were correct) in a timely manner.
