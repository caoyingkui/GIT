    "description": "The current Solr Ref Guide is hosted at cwiki.apache.org, a Confluence installation. There are numerous reasons to be dissatisfied with the current setup, a few of which are:\n\n\n\tConfluence as a product is no longer designed for our use case and our type of content.\n\tThe writing/editing experience is painful and a barrier for all users, who need to learn a lot of Confluence-specific syntax just to help out with some content.\n\tNon-committers can't really help improve documentation except to point out problems and hope someone else fixes them.\n\tWe really can't maintain online documentation for different versions. Users on versions other than the one that hasn't been released yet are only given a PDF to work with.\n\n\n\nI made a proposal in Aug 2016 (email link) to move the Ref Guide from Confluence to a new system that relies on asciidoc-formatted text files integrated with the Solr source code. \n\nThis is an umbrella issue for the sub-tasks and related decisions to make that proposal a reality. A lot of work has already been done as part of a proof-of-concept, but there are many things left to do. Some of the items to be completed include:\n\n\n\tCreation of a branch and moving the early POC work I've done to the project\n\tConversion the content and clean up of unavoidable post-conversion issues\n\tDecisions about location of source files, branching strategy and hosting for online versions\n\tMeta-documentation for publication process, beginner tips, etc. (whatever else people need or want)\n\tIntegration of build processes with the broader project\n\n\n\nFor reference, a demo of what the new ref guide might look like is currently online at http://people.apache.org/~ctargett/RefGuidePOC/.\n\nCreation of sub-tasks to follow shortly.",

            "content": "I've created a branch and added most of the files that existed in my POC github repo. The branch is jira/solr-10290. \n\nThe new solr/solr-ref-guide directory contains the build scripts and tools, as well as the source content and images. It can build the HTML files and/or the PDF. The README explains a bit more about the directory structure and dependencies required to do a build. PDFs can be built without anything locally installed; the HTML needs a few things installed first. The source content is from an export of Confluence done about a month ago, so be forewarned it's slightly out of date.\n\nThe new solr/confluence-export directory includes all the tools used in the conversion of the content from Confluence's HTML to Asciidoc format, plus the post-conversion automated cleanup. Also included should be the raw export used and files from intermediary steps in the conversion process, but I'm having huge problems today with large uploads to ASF Git, so it will be a little bit longer before I can get all that into the repo where it belongs. IOW, don't try to use the conversion tools yet in case you were so inclined to do so. \n\nThe intent is that we'll get the content converted and then the confluence-export directory will go away entirely so we won't need to carry these tools around with us when this is merged to master.

On every build, every page is \"new\" since we don't build HTML pages only for files that have changed since last time - so a list of 10 pages doesn't really get anyone anywhere. And it's the same for every build, so my opinion is that it provides no value in it's current form. It's not on any of my various lists to change it - someone else would need to care about it to fix it.\n\nObviously, \"fixing\" it (and sitemap.xml) just means fixing the URL in _config.yml.template, which needs to be parameterized so it's correct for every version that's built. Not sure it needs a whole issue for itself. Since you brought it up here, you could just use this one. ",

But that would make the URL https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6.6 which is inconsistent with paths we use elsewhere, as in Javadocs. In the sitemap.xml liquid template, I believe you could try a replace filter on the site.url to transform it to a underscore? May need to play around with that.\n\nAnd, my thought is that we should stick to https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6 to keep things simple - Hoss added guide versions in SOLR-10675, and those will be on each page and in the footer of the PDF.

Output is now\n\n  <url>\n    <loc>https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/about-this-guide.html</loc>\n  </url>\n\n\nAlso removed tag in head and other refs to feed.xml.
