    "description": "Pardon this submission if I have not followed any established protocols, I'm new to the this system and also not well versed in solr in general and did not see any guidelines to issue submission. But, I believe this to be a legitimate issue not previously identified, at least in some use cases.\n\nFields, whose content may contain hyphens, are sorted by the string occurring after the last hyphen. In my case, this is happening on a field storing last names. For example: \"Abel-Johnson\" will be sorted as if it held the value \"Johnson\" excluding the content before the hyphen.\n\nI've searched through the existing issues, and there seem to be plenty of references to issues surrounding query strings which may contain hyphens in either field names, or arguments, but nothing referring to the content itself.",
