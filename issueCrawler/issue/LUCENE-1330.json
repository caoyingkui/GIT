    "description": "Setting a position increment of 0 for the first token in a field results in its \"absolute position\" (as well as increment) being read back later as Integer.MIN_VALUE.\n\nThis is a result of how the information gets written out in DocumentsWriter: position should not be updated using += t.getPositionIncrement() - 1; and then always ++'ed in addPosition. It would be much simpler just to update it using t.getPositionIncrement().\n\nWhile this is fairly easy to fix in DocumentsWriter, one could just update the documentation for Token.setPositionIncrement() to indicate that for indexing purposes the first Token in a field must have a positive position increment.",
