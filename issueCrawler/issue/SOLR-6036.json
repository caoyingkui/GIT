NOTE: in Solr 4.0, replicationFactor was the number of additional copies as opposed to the total number of copies\n\nThe \"NOTE\" above refers specifically to one specific release \u2013 Solr 4.0.  In 4.1 and later (including the just-released 4.8), if you specify replicationFactor=2, you will get a total of two replicas.  One of them will be elected the leader.  There will not be a leader and two additional copies \u2013 there will be exactly two.  To create a collection that has no redundancy, use replicationFactor=1.\n\nI have created the collections on my small SolrCloud install with replicationFactor=2, running Solr 4.2.1.  I have exactly two copies of every shard.  I have not seen anything in any SOLR-NNNN issue or any code commit to change this meaning.\n\nThe \"if\" statement in the code is correct.  If you specified a replication factor of zero, there would be no index. "
