    "description": "I am trying to access a field in custom request handler. I am accessing it like this for each document:\n\nDocument doc;\ndoc = reader.document(id);\nDocFields = doc.getValues(\"state\");\nThere are around 600,000 documents in the solr. For a query running on all the docs, it is taking more than 65 seconds.\n\nI have also tried SolrIndexSearcher.doc method, but it is also taking around 60 seconds.\n\nRemoving the above lines of code bring down the qtime to milliseconds. But, I need to access that field for my algo.\n\nIs there a more optimised way to do this?",

You're going out to disk and decompressing at least 16K for each doc. This is an anti-pattern as stated in the docs.\n\nOne possibility would be to access the indexed term directly, or perhaps create it as a DocValues field and access that.\n\nPlease ask for further details on the user's list.
