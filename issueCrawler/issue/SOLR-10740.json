However there are situations that this is not possible.\n\nAt first optimization was done serially, maybe this could help for the desired behavior? e.g select only the appropriate core in the nodes commit iterration?\n(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-6264)\n\nAlso by looking down the DistributedUpdateProcessor code there is a rather undocumented param named commit_end_point (line: 1898) that seems to do a local commit, could this be the solution to the problem?",
