    "description": "Right now, to update the values (max time and max docs) for hard and soft autocommits one has to alter the configuration and reload the core. I think it may be nice, to expose an API to do that in a way, that the configuration is not updated, so the change is not persistent. \n\nThere may be various reasons for doing that - for example one may know that the application will send large amount of data and want to prepare for that.",

            "content": "I absolutely love the idea here.  The implementation feels awkward, though.  I've written my fair share of awkward code, so I hope you'll find this to be constructive criticism.\n\nWhat I envision is something that works with a URL like the following, with the name of the handler and the specific action parameter something that can be hashed out together.  Even this action name feels awkward, but I like the idea of having a bunch of parameters instead of separate actions.  It allows you to make one API call to change all related parameters:\n\n/solr/admin/transientconfig?action=UPDATEAUTOCOMMITPARAMS&autoCommitMaxTime=NNNN&autoCommitMaxDocs=NNNN&autoSoftCommitMaxTime=NNNN&autoSoftCommitMaxDocs=NNNN "

And what if a distributed/SolrCloud node goes down and then comes back up?  Differing configurations might trigger weird conditions.\n\nAn alternative for some changes could be to always persist changes, but not require core reloads? "
