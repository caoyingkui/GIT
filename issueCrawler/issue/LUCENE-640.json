    "description": "I was able to improve the performance of 'doNext() of 'ConjunctionScorer' by over 20% by storing the result of some calls that were performed multiple times in local variables. The test program invoked the method over 400,000 times on each run.\n\nI ran the performance tests on: \n\n\tWindows XP Pro SP2\n\tSun JDK 1.5.0_07\n\tYourKit 5.5.4\n\tLucene trunk",
