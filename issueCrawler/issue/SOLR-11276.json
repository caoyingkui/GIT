            "content": "Initial patch, the idea here is to remove SolrZkClient.updateKeeper(SolrZooKeeper keeper) and let SolrZkClient to manage when to close its keeper. \nI also removed DefaultConnectionStrategy, because I think ZkUpdate is complex ( sometime it's hard to know where an Exception will be catched ). ZkClientConnectionStrategy is enough for create new instance of SolrZooKeeper.\n\nMark Miller Ramkumar Aiyengar Shalin Shekhar Mangar what do you think? ",

For something like this though, it would be nice to add some additional testing to make sure we can be confident these changes don't break any behavior we rely on that may not easily show up in current tests.
