    "description": "Currently, the release process requires the release manager to type in their password for every artifact that needs to be signed.  Using Ant 1.7.1 and GPG this can be avoided.\n\nThis patch will change the build to only require the password to be input once, at the beginning of signing.  It will use Ant's SecureInputHandler, which only comes with Ant 1.7.1 and higher",
