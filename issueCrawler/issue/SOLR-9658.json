The cache configuration can have an extra config maxIdleTime . if we wish it to the cleaned after 10 mins of inactivity set it to maxIdleTime=600. Scott Blum would it be a solution for the memory leak you mentioned?",

Assuming I don't want auto warmed queries, I might naively think that an auto soft commit should have the effect of evicting caches since it would invalidate the results.  Do you know why that doesn't seem to happen? ",
