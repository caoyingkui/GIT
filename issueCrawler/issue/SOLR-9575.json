    "description": "The user may not want to use Solr's default solr-home dir location \u2013 most likely to use a separate disk.  If you do this, there are two main problems:\n\n\tsolr.xml & zoo.cfg aren't there\n\tconfigsets aren't there\n\n\n\nOf course you could copy it manually but that's an extra step, and it's particularly annoying to add this step to a Docker setup.  Docker is all the rage these days, and for good reason.  If I mount a volume at /opt/solr/server/solr then it basically masks this part of the built-in Solr image (thus making configsets completely invisible) and points to some place that will be empty.  Solr obviously complains.  I could set the solr-home to some other path that I mount, but Solr would still complain about an empty solr-home \u2013 no solr.xml\n\nIf solr-home is empty, and if it's a dir other than the default solr-home, then I think the solr-home should be initialized with solr.xml and zoo.cfg copied from the default solr-home.  I think configsets should be referenced from the default solr-home if there is no configsets dir in solr-home.",

            "content": "Thanks for the input.  SOLR-8649 would not be a problem with the additional requirement of \"empty\" as indicated in the title of this ticket.  It should not be enough for solr.xml to be absent, in what I propose here \u2013 the directory should be empty. If that is not convincing enough, then what about an additional optional env variable like SOLR_HOME_INIT_EMPTY?  I'm not opposed to a separate bin/solr init-home ... suggestion, but that doesn't resolve this issue \u2013 it doesn't help Docker specifically in which I can only set one command to run, plus env variables.  Yeah people can and do build their own images for software they use all the time, but Solr would be much easier to use via Docker if we didn't ask people to do that. ",

Note that since the last time I commented, in the docker-solr project, I managed to convince its maintainer (Martijn Koster) to add an opt-in equivalent:  https://github.com/docker-solr/docker-solr/blob/master/scripts/init-solr-home#L26   INIT_SOLR_HOME env var.  Nonetheless it'd be better to have this feature up-streamed (in Solr proper) so that docker-solr needn't have this extra. ",
