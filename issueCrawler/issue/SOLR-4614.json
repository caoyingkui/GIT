    "description": "When my program sends an UpdateRequest to a collection that has been deleted, I am getting a NPE\n\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.apache.solr.client.solrj.util.ClientUtils.addSlices(ClientUtils.java:273)\n    at org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.CloudSolrServer.request(CloudSolrServer.java:214)\n    at org.apache.solr.client.solrj.request.AbstractUpdateRequest.process(AbstractUpdateRequest.java:117)\n\n\n\nThis appears to be caused by the fact that ClusterState#getSlices is returning null instead of an empty collection.\n\nClusterState returning null: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_1/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/cloud/ClusterState.java#L123\nClientUtil#addSlices iterating over a null: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_1/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/util/ClientUtils.java#L273\n\nI would attach a patch, but I'm not sure what the preferred style is within the project (empty collection vs null checks).",

I have not looked into what that affects, but I think I hit this same thing and went with a fix higher up of:\n\n\n        if (colSlices == null) {\n          throw new SolrServerException(\"Could not find collection:\" + collectionName);\n        }\n\n\n\nI guess it depends on what adding slices to a null slice means - my first thought was that it was an error.
