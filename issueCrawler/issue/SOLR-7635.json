I would imagine that currently if lsof is not installed but the port IS already in use, that the script may try to start Solr anyway, and I'm not sure that the user would know why it doesn't work. ",

            "content": "If lsof doesn't exist, then we can't check for them, I'd say it is better to report no lsof and say \"attempting to start\", and let it fail with \"port in use\" if that happens. Alternatively, given we have Java to hand, a simple java class that attempts to connect to Solr wouldn't be too hard to write in this scenario.\n\nHowever, the point of this ticket is simply to fix a case I had where bin/solr start refused to start Solr even though it wasn't running. lsof was listing my browser's connection to Solr, rather than Solr listening. This patch will prevent that happening. ",
