    "description": "In JoinQParserPlugin.java, the method createParser builds a QParser like this:\n\nQParser fromQueryParser = subQuery(v, \"lucene\");\n\nThis prevent us from using this syntax to select a query parser for the join operation:\nqf=text name\nq=\n{!join from=manu_id_s to=id defType=dismax}\nipod\n\nAs a workaround, we can use var dereferencing:\nqf=text name\nq=\n{!join from=manu_id_s to=id v=$qq}\nqq=\n{!dismax}\nipod\n\nBut according to Hoss, just replacing the hardcoded \"lucene\" with null should allow to use the first syntax.\n\nSee this thread:\nhttp://search-lucene.com/m/y2GA92nZr211&subj=Re+Solr+Join+with+Dismax",
