    "description": "ApostropheTokenizer creates extra tokens during the analysis stage for the fields containing apostrophes. The reason for adding this is to ensure that documents that differ only by apostrophe have the same relevancy score. \n\nFor example, if the document contains string \"McDonald's\", it will be tokenized as \"McDonald's McDonalds\". This way when the search is performed against \"McDonald's\" or \"McDonalds\" will produce similar score.\n\nThis code handles up to two apostrophes in a token.\n\nTo use this tokenizer add the following line in schema.xml\n\n<analyzer type=\"index\">\n      <filter class=\"org.apache.lucene.analysis.ApostropheTokenFactory\"/>\n...\n</analyzer>",
