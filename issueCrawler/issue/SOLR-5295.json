    "description": "As reported by Brett Hoerner on solr-user:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/solr-user@lucene.apache.org/msg89545.html\n\n\nIt seems that changes in 4.5 collection configuration now require users to\nset a maxShardsPerNode (or it defaults to 1).\n\nMaybe this was the case before, but with the new CREATESHARD API it seems a\nvery restrictive. I've just created a very simple test collection on 3\nmachines where I set maxShardsPerNode at collection creation time to 1, and\nI made 3 shards. Everything is good.\n\nNow I want a 4th shard, it seems impossible to create because the cluster\n\"knows\" I should only have 1 shard per node. Yet my problem doesn't require\nmore hardware, I just my new shard to exist on one of the existing servers.\n\nSo I try again \u2013 I create a collection with 3 shards and set\nmaxShardsPerNode to 1000 (just as a silly test). Everything is good.\n\nNow I add shard4 and it immediately tries to add 1000 replicas of shard4...",
