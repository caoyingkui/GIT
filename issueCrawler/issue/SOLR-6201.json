    "description": "In SOLR 4.4 and possibly higher Its possible to have multiple directory factories defined.  This can become very problematic because, in  a large xml file, it is tricky to determine which file system is being used, in case someone appends an alternate file system at the  end.  The result : Core files are stored in a different location.\n\n\n\n  <directoryFactory name=\"DirectoryFactory\" class=\"org.apache.solr.core.HdfsDirectoryFactory\">\n    ....\n   </directoryFactory>\n\n  <directoryFactory name=\"DirectoryFactory2\" class=\"my.company.CustomDirectoryFactory\">\n    ....\n   </directoryFactory>\n\n\n\nIt would be better if the directoryFactory failed when multiple factories were defined, since clearly, this is a user error which will result in non-deterministic core behaviour (at best).",
