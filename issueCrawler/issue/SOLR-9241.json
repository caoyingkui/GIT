    "description": "This is the v1 of the patch for Solrcloud Rebalance api (as described in http://engineering.bloomreach.com/solrcloud-rebalance-api/) , built at Bloomreach by Nitin Sharma and Suruchi Shah. The goal of the API  is to provide a zero downtime mechanism to perform data manipulation and  efficient core allocation in solrcloud. This API was envisioned to be the base layer that enables Solrcloud to be an auto scaling platform. (and work in unison with other complementing monitoring and scaling features).\n\n\nPatch Status:\n===============\nThe patch is work in progress and incremental. We have done a few rounds of code clean up. We wanted to get the patch going first to get initial feed back.  We will continue to work on making it more open source friendly and easily testable.\n\n Deployment Status:\n====================\nThe platform is deployed in production at bloomreach and has been battle tested for large scale load. (millions of documents and hundreds of collections).\n\n Internals:\n=============\nThe internals of the API and performance : http://engineering.bloomreach.com/solrcloud-rebalance-api/\n\nIt is built on top of the admin collections API as an action (with various flavors). At a high level, the rebalance api provides 2 constructs:\n\nScaling Strategy:  Decides how to move the data.  Every flavor has multiple options which can be reviewed in the api spec.\nRe-distribute  - Move around data in the cluster based on capacity/allocation.\nAuto Shard  - Dynamically shard a collection to any size.\nSmart Merge - Distributed Mode - Helps merging data from a larger shard setup into smaller one.  (the source should be divisible by destination)\nScale up -  Add replicas on the fly\nScale Down - Remove replicas on the fly\n\nAllocation Strategy:  Decides where to put the data.  (Nodes with least cores, Nodes that do not have this collection etc). Custom implementations can be built on top as well. One other example is Availability Zone aware. Distribute data such that every replica is placed on different availability zone to support HA.\n\n Detailed API Spec:\n====================\n  https://github.com/bloomreach/solrcloud-rebalance-api\n\n Contributors:\n=====================\n  Nitin Sharma\n  Suruchi Shah\n\n Questions/Comments:\n=====================\n  You can reach me at nitinssn@gmail.com",

            "content": "I'm also very excited to see this patch. For the next evolution of Solr's scalability (and ultimately auto-scaling), these are exactly the kinds of core capabilities we need for seamlessly scaling up/down, resharding, and redistributing shards and replicas across a cluster. \n\nThe smart merge looks interesting - seems like effectively a way to index into a larger number of shards (for indexing throughput) while merging them into a smaller number of shards for searching, enabling scaling of indexing and searching resourced independently. This obviously won't work well with Near-Realtime Searching, but I'd be curious to hear more explanation about how this works in practice for SolrCloud clusters that don't need NRT search.\n\nAgreed with Joel's comments about the update to trunk vs. 4.6.1. One thing that seems to have been added since 4.6.1 that probably overlaps with this patch is the Replica Placement Strategies (SOLR-6220) vs. the Allocation Strategies implemented here.\n\nThe rest of the patch seems like all new objects that don't overlap much with the current code base. Would be interesting to know how much has changed between 4.6.1 to 6.1 collections/SolrCloud-wise that would create conflicts with this patch. Am obviously hoping not too much...\n\nEither way, very excited about the contribution and about the potential for getting these capabilities integrated into Solr. ",

Optionally, the command should accept node names\n\nScale Up\nThis should be merged into the ADDREPLICA command. That command should accept  a call with a collection name (shard-name can be optional) and nu:of replicas to be added. The system should automatically identify the nodes and create replicas\n\nScale down\n\nFold this into DELETEREPLICA command. The command should accept the no:of replicas to remove \n\nRemove dead nodes\n\nA new command DELETENODE to clean up all replicas in that node\n\nReplace\n\nA new command called REPLACENODE to be created. \n\n\nAuto Shard\n\nWe need to revisit the whole strategy. The current model is neither scalable nor useful. It is not possible to merge all shards into one and split them later. That cannot work for a seriously sized cluster. We need a new mechanism to intelligently to merge shards. We then need to identify new hash ranges in such a way that the no:of splits and merges are minimal. The command would be called as RESHARD and we should pass it the no:of new shards to be created. \n\n\n\n\n ",

Ex. /solr/admin?action=REPLACENODE.... or /solr/admin/collections?action=REBALANCE&scaling_strategy=REPLACENODE? \n\n2) What is the default behavior of the replica replacement strategy? Does it pick unused nodes or just uses round robin to pick the next replica? We have unused and least used as 2 allocation strategies.
