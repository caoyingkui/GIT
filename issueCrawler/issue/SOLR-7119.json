    "description": "The documentation for Faceting - Tagging and Excluding Filters says (emphasis mine):\nFilter exclusion is supported for all types of facets.\n\nBut using the {!ex} local param with an interval facet does not work.  This query returns 0 in `facet_counts.facet_intervals.weight`.\n\n\nhttp://.../select?q=*:*&fq={!tag=weight}weight:[45 TO 100}&facet=true&facet.interval=weight&facet.interval.set={!ex=weight}[*,45)\n\n\n\nA workaround appears to be to use query facets instead of interval facets.  This query returns the expected facet count:\n\n\nhttp://.../select?q=*:*&fq={!tag=weight}weight:[45 TO 100}&facet=true&facet.query={!ex=weight}weight:[* TO 45}\n\n\n\nI want to use this for a multi-select faceting UI.  Some of our facets are field or query facets while others are intervals.\n\nAt least, it would be helpful if the documentation said which kinds of facets this works for.\n\nLooking at the code in IntervalFacets.java, it appears that {!key} is the only local param currently supported.",
