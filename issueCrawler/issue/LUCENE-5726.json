            "content": "I think for this issue, the trick is to make CompoundFileDirectory not pass just the filename (_1.fdt) as the resource description, but instead something more complex. it should be a nicely named string that makes it clear its a CFS slice (ideally including the original handle description completely).\n\nI think its ok to build a good string here, because this is not called per query or anything. We can enhance the javadocs of slice() to say that the caller is responsible for passing the description in or something like that (caller has the original indexinput to toString() if it wants to use that).
