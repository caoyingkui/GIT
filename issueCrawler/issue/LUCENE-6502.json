    "description": "The RectIntersectionTestHelper requires a minimum number of occurrences of each relation type before it passes, and there are a minimum number of attempts.  But this can be a bit much, and too often it can cause a spurious test failure that isn't really a bug.  Instead, it should simply try to find at least one of every case in a minimum number of tries.\n\nThis would solve this bug today: http://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-trunk-Linux/12825/",

            "content": "Here's a patch.  It improves the clarity of the class \u2013 e.g. \"minLaps\" should have been \"maxLaps\", etc.  I reconsidered on demanding just 1 occurrence each time, as it's really dependent on the number of laps.  The problem is that in rare cases with path & polygon based on Geo3D's random test shape generator as currently written, it may be necessary to try many, many, attempts before finding a \"Within\" predicate occurrence.  So I bumped up the max laps to 200k and for the case of Within, we'll just look for 1.  We can always revisit the 200k figure in the future if it needs to be larger.\n\nWhat do you think Karl Wright?
