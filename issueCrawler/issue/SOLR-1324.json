    "description": "Logging this idea... A persisting update processor could be implemented to send all commands through some \"persister\" abstraction.  One straightforward implementation could write all actions to Solr XML files on the file system.\n\nIssues to consider: need to write files in chronological order to play them back in sequence.  what about commits/delets/rollbacks?  do we persist these other commands or only adds?  on playback (say java -jar post.jar *.xml), need to have a way to not persist.\n\nNeed to persist the SolrInputDocument, not the Lucene document.",
