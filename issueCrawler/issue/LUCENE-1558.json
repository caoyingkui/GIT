Seems silly to force people to specify true/false when they create an IndexReader.  But maybe wait until we reach closure on the config/builder discussion on java-dev? ",

            "content": "Personally, I'm not so sure its a bad idea making the user specify as it is now\n\nThe thing is, I expect the vast majority of users use readOnly=true, and to those users they would be baffled that IndexReader even has a readOnly=false possibility.  \"Simple things should be simple\".  Also, the exception that's thrown if you attempt a write operation against a readOnly reader is pretty darned clear about what's gone wrong:\n\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"This IndexReader cannot make any changes to the index (it was opened with readOnly = true)\");\n\n(We can reword it to say something like \"You must open the IndexReader with readOnly=false to make changes\" or some such).\n\nIn other cases, I would agree we should force sneaky parameters to be explicit on construction, so users think about the choice.  EG we did this with maxFieldLength to IndexWriter, because in that case the truncation was silent, actually resulted in losing indexed content,  and we saw from our user's that it tripped people up far too often.  But I don't think this case fits that same pattern... ",
