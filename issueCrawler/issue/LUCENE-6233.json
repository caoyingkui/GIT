    "description": "I'm working on a test that creates a biggish index and I noticed the CheckIndex takes a surprisingly long time to check term vectors.\n\nI profiled it and uncovered that we spend a lot of time (not sure this explains all of it) in Terms.getMin/getMax.  Since CompressingTermVectorsReader doesn't impl these methods efficiently (which is fine), we fallback to super's impl, which does a digit-by-digit binary search using seekCeil.\n\nBut for TVs this sometimes results in a linear scan.\n\nI think CheckIndex should not check Terms.getMin/Max for TVs?",
