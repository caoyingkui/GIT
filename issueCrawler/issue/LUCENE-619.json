    "description": "The lucene JARs at the URL listed in the Environment field only contain the maven 2 POMs, and not the actual compiled classes. The correct JARs need to be uploaded so that Lucene 1.9.1. and 2.0 can work in Maven 2.\n\nThis was listed as fixed in http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-551, but was not properly done. The JARs in the Apache Maven repo are incorrect as well. (http://www.apache.org/dist/maven-repository/org/apache/lucene/lucene-core/)\n\nThis issue was raised and confirmed on the mailing list as well: \nhttp://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/37169",
