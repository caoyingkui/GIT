    "description": "I'd like to simplify the Solr UIMA tutorial by removing the files in solr/contrib/uima/src/resources/solr/collection1/conf, and putting the couple of lines of content into the wiki directly.  The files aren't used by the unit tests, and are not complete solrconfig/schema.xml files that you can drop in, so you go from the wiki to SVN, and then back.   Before I make these changes, I'd like to get some agreement from someone else!",
