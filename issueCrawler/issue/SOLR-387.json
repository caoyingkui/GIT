    "description": "I have found a couple of instances where I need to hook code in to modify the queries sent to RequestHandler and DisMaxRequestHandler before they are executed. The structure of these classes under Solr 1.2 does not lend itself to this type of extension. I have a patch which adds an additional method:\n\n    public void addCustomBehavior (SolrQueryRequest req, SolrQueryResponse rsp, List<Query> queries, List<SortField> sortFields)\n\nSubclasses of the request handlers can then implement this method to hook in their custom code.\n\nThis code fix would be made obsolete by SOLR-281 (Search Component Plugins)\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-281",
