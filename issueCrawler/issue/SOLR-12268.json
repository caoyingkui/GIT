    "description": "When we open a new reader from a writer, we get an IndexWriter lock and may call applyAllDeletesAndUpdates. That call can take a while holding the lock. Meanwhile calls coming to /admin/cores get isCurrent for the reader, which checks if the IndexWriter is closed, which requires the IndexWriter lock. These leads to /admin/cores calls taking as long as applyAllDeletesAndUpdates.",

The isCurrent info is actually not very useful though and can significantly slow down these calls when applying deletes takes a long time.\n\nSo the current situation is not great in two ways:\n\n1. It's not apparent that you will hit this problem, so a user trying to monitor index stats won't know they should turn off index info.\n2. IndexInfo seems like the most likely info a monitoring system would want. ",
