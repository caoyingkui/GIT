THe important thing is to recognize when the situation arises and give a clear feedback about the with access to the stuff that really matters in that situation (ie: why don't you have any cores? was there an error? how to i add a core?) ... even if that UI is incredibly simplified.\n\nIn my patch, i was trying to maintain the nav links in the left, so new users would at least have a taste for what features the UI offers once cores are added (and so we could have a place to incorporate SOLR-3635) ... but that's certainly not necessary.\n\nI think the way to go for now is a new, simple, screen w/o any assumptions about anything else that says \"You don't have any cores, here's the form to add a core, and BTW here are some known init failures from other cores that might explain why you don't have any cores.\"\n "

            "content": "Erick,\n\nI suppose the problem has improved in 4.4.0 from 4.3.0 in that I no longer see a Java exception, but the red box error message in the web UI that no cores are active and that Solr can't work in such a state is completely unhelpful, as I pointed out in comments above. Either new users such as myself need some way to add a core back through the web UI, and/or the web UI should continue working even when there are zero active cores. Right now the only way out is to re-install since I have no idea which XML files to change or how.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nAaron "
