Some files contain deprecations that I am less sure of--I didn't make any changes to those.  They are primarily related to refactoring done in SOLR-135, SOLR-215, and SOLR-301.\n\nAdditionally, I noticed that @Deprecated is commented out in two places in org/apache/solr/handler/XmlUpdateRequestHandler.java.  I'm not sure if that is meant to be commented out or not.\n\nHere are the files which still have uncommented @Deprecation annotations.\n\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/request/SolrQueryRequestBase.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/request/SolrQueryRequest.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/admin/ShowFileRequestHandler.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/XmlUpdateRequestHandler.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/tst/OldRequestHandler.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/tst/TestRequestHandler.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/util/TestHarness.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/util/CommonParams.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/core/Config.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/core/SolrInfoRegistry.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/core/SolrCore.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/core/SolrConfig.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/search/DocSet.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/schema/IndexSchema.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/schema/FieldType.java\n./src/java/org/apache/solr/analysis/WordDelimiterFilter.java\n./src/webapp/src/org/apache/solr/servlet/SolrUpdateServlet.java\n./src/webapp/src/org/apache/solr/servlet/SolrServlet.java "
