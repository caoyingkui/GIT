    "description": "If you have an html document where the title is repeated as a heading at the top of the document, the HTMLParser will return the title as the summary, ignoring everything else that was added to the summary. Instead, it should keep the rest of the summary and chop off the title part at the beginning (essentially the opposite). I don't see any benefit to repeating the title in the summary for any case.\n\nIn HTMLParser.jj's getSummary():\n\n    String sum = summary.toString().trim();\n    String tit = getTitle();\n    if (sum.startsWith(tit) || sum.equals(\"\"))\n      return tit;\n    else\n      return sum;\n\nchange it to: (* denotes a line that has changed)\n\n    String sum = summary.toString().trim();\n    String tit = getTitle();\n\n\tif (sum.startsWith(tit))             // don't repeat title in summary\n\treturn sum.substring(tit.length()).trim();\n    else\n      return sum;",
