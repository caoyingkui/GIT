    "description": "In the class SolrDispatchFilter, the destroy method is as follows:\n\n  public void destroy() \n{\n    core.close();\n  }\n\nThe problem is when the servlet doesn't initialize properly (for example, if there is a problem in schema.xml) then core isn't initialized, and this will throw a NullPointerException.  A better implementation would be:\n\n  public void destroy() \n{\n    if (core != null) core.close();\n  }",
