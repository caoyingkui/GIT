    "description": "There is a leniency in the test that makes the test pass if a bwc index doesn't have a version associated to it:\n\n\n// we could be missing up to 1 file, which may be due to a release that is in progress\n    if (missingFiles.size() <= 1 && extraFiles.isEmpty()) {\n      // success\n      return;\n    }\n\n\n\nI think this test can be removed since we add the new released version in the non-release branches only after the release.  Then we'd need to add the released version and\n the BWC test in the non-release branches in the same commit so that the test never fails.",

            "content": "Argh, scratch that, this is only true for bugfix releases. For minor and major releases we have two versions that are not released in the non-release branches so the leniency is needed. There is no way to know if a minor release that is not the latest in the major has been released or not so this leniency is needed. The release howto has been updated with a specific section about adding version for bugfix releases in the non-release branches, I don't have a better solution so I'll close this issue for now. ",
