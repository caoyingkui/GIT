    "description": "TestInPlaceUpdatesDistrib depends on consistent segments to track docIds to assert in-place updates.\n\nTowards that, NoMergePolicy is best suited and working fine on master (by defining it using NoMergePolicyFactory).\n\nThis doesn't work with just the MergePolicy (systemSetPropertySolrTestsMergePolicy()), since NoMergePolicy is a singleton and doesn't have a constructor. Setting only a NoMergePolicyFactory (systemSetPropertySolrTestsMergePolicyFactory()) seems to take no effect and falls back on RandomMergePolicyFactory. As a result, this test cannot use the NoMergePolicy[Factory].\n\nHere's the corresponding test failure: https://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-master-Linux/19012/\n\nSeems to me that SOLR-8668 needs to be backported to branch_6x for this test to work, or some other stopgap hack needs to be put in place to make it work before SOLR-8668 is backported. Christine Poerschke, WDYT?\nEdit: This is also valid for master. ^",

MergePolicy[Factory] logic as far as I recall and SOLR-8668 itself i.e. the removal of (deprecated) MergePolicy support on master branch in favour of (replacement) MergePolicyFactory remains to be done.\n\n... or some other stopgap ...\n\nIf the deprecated code path i.e. MergePolicy is troublesome for the test then something like this (for branch_6x only) might work to 'skip' the troublesome code path when randomisation leads the test to take the deprecated merge policy rather than the replacement merge policy factory code path.\n\nassumeFalse(\"true\".equals(System.getenv(SolrTestCaseJ4.SYSTEM_PROPERTY_SOLR_TESTS_USEMERGEPOLICY)));\n\n ",

This hack is at least better than \"skip the troublesome code\" using assumeFalse. Still, I'm unhappy about having to hack this way; but unfortunately, I don't have time to dive deeper right now. ",
