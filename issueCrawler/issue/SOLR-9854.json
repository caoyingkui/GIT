See the details on branch jira/solr-9854, here's a short log of key commits from this branch:\n\ncommit 6ceb05074b3f6303e660613e277c3e26472ec627\nAuthor: Andrzej Bialecki <ab@apache.org>\nDate:   Fri Dec 23 21:30:15 2016 +0100\n\n    SOLR-9854 Move metrics collection to SolrIndexWriter to get more meaningful\n    timings of merges. Other changes:\n    * simplify metric names in MetricUtils. Don't scale units for non-timer histograms\n      as they may represent other units (eg. bytes)\n    * add ability to configure metric details and parameters (currently the threshold\n      between minor and major merges).\n...\ncommit ce8ab8c6359753623ae7a96204badd16193efc09\nAuthor: Andrzej Bialecki <ab@apache.org>\nDate:   Thu Dec 15 13:33:28 2016 +0100\n\n    SOLR-9854 Initial version. This adds metrics to Directory IO and also\n    monitors minor / major merge operations.\n\n ",
