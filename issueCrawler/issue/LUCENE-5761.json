We have seen disk-doc-value as our only option, it actually works, and we can live with it being \"slow\" ",

E.g. that it memory mapped the entire doc-values file. But I really do not know anything about how it works. We will try the non-\"Disk\" doc-values when we get that far.\n\nThanks again! ",
