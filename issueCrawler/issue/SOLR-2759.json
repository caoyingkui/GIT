    "description": "ExtendedDisMaxQParserPlugin.ExtendedAnalyzer cannot be ported over to being reusable due to its support for deciding at runtime whether stopwords should be filtered or not.  \n\nOne way to resolve this is to maintain 2 lazy-initialized Map<String, Analyzer> in the ExtendedSolrQueryParser, one with the stopword filtering Analyzers for fields, the other with no-stopword filtering Analyzers.  Then ExtendedSolrQueryParser can override the QueryParserBase.newFieldQuery(Analyzer, String, String, boolean) and substitute in the appropriate Analyzer based on the runtime behavior desired at that time.\n\nThis will mean an ever so slight increase in memory consumption due to the 2 maps, but will allow for reusability which will reduce memory consumption and increase query throughput.",
