    "description": "Currently, the QuickStart tutorial included in the ref guide involves running the following command to index some example documents: bin/post -c techproducts example/exampledocs/*\n\nThis ends up attempting to index all the files in that directory, which includes the expected example files, but also as bash script called test_utf8.sh and the post.jar JAR file itself.\n\nThe subsequent tutorial step involves searching results, which can bring up the ugly result:\n\n      {\n        \"id\":\"/home/jason/checkouts/lucene-solr/solr/example/exampledocs/post.jar\",\n        \"resourcename\":\"/home/jason/checkouts/lucene-solr/solr/example/exampledocs/post.jar\",\n        \"content_type\":[\"application/java-archive\"],\n        \"content\":[\" \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF \\n Manifest-Version: 1.0\\r\\nAnt-Version: Apache Ant 1.9.6\\r\\nCreated-By: 1.8.0_151-8u151-b12-0ubuntu0.16.04.2-b12 (Oracle Corp\norati\\r\\n on)\\r\\nMain-Class: org.apache.solr.util.SimplePostTool\\r\\n\\r\\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n  org/apache/solr/util/RTimer$1.class \\n  package  org.apache.solr.util;\\n synchronized   class  RTimer$1 {\\n}\\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n  o\nrg/apache/solr/util/RTimer$NanoTimeTimerImpl.class \\n  package  org.apache.solr.util;\\n synchronized   class  RTimer$NanoTimeTimerImpl  implements  RTimer$TimerImpl {\\n     private  long  start ;\\n     private  \nvoid RTimer$NanoTimeTimerImpl();\\n     public  void  start ();\\n     public  double  elapsed ();\\n}\\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n  org/apache/solr/util/RTimer$TimerImpl.class \\n  package  org.apache.solr.util;\\n public   abstra\nct   interface  RTimer$TimerImpl {\\n     public   abstract  void  start ();\\n     public   abstract  double  elapsed ();\\n}\\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n  org/apache/solr/util/RTimer.class \\n  package  org.apache.solr.util;\\n p\nublic   synchronized   class  RTimer {\\n     public   static   final  int  STARTED  = 0;\\n     public   static   final  int  STOPPED  = 1;\\n     public   static   final  int  PAUSED  = 2;\\n     protected  int  s\n  ......[remaining code skipped for brevity]........\"],\n        \"_version_\":1583971861929132032},\n\n\n\nIt's honestly pretty cool that TIKA can extract code from our post.jar file.  It makes sense, but I didn't expect it.  But it's probably not what we intended to show to new users.  Especially considering that the bin/post invocation in the quick-start tutorial claims to be choosy about what filetypes it will index:\n\n\nEntering auto mode. File endings considered are xml,json,jsonl,csv,pdf,doc,docx,ppt,pptx,xls,xlsx,odt,odp,ods,ott,otp,ots,rtf,htm,html,txt,log\n\n\n\nFrom a quick glance at things, it looks like bin/post does pass a list of permissible filetypes to the underlying SimplePostTool, but that SimplePostTool doesn't follow this extension whitelist in the particular mode being invoked by the quickstart tutorial.  So this is probably a wider bug, that the quickstart/tutorial just happens to expose.",
