    "description": "When query with a invalid field in QF,  the query text will not be parsed/interpreted in Lucene's syntax:  All Boolean Operator will be treated as raw text for searching. \n\nFor Example: I misspelled a field name,\"product_labels\", by missing suffix \"s\" in QF , and the query was \"cpu AND amd\".  I enabled debuqQuery and found the \"AND\" is analyzed and tokenized  as raw text. which was supposed to be treated as Boolean Operator.\n\nI spend half an hour to google it but nothing helpful(at the beginning I thought there's something like \"syntax switch\" was turned off by mistake).\n\nnot critical , It does bother. \n(at least) We should add indicator like \"partialResults\" in the response. OR reject the query and return 400 directly, evidencing the bug in application layer.",
