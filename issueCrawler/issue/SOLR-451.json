Thus, analysis.jsp and analysis.xsl should be changed to use POST instead.  It would also be nicer to have a bigger input for the textarea (8+ cols)\n\nPatch to follow.",

Anything really big would just be cut-n-pasted, no?\n\nIt's just easier to read once it is in there, instead of scrolling through lots and lots of lines or having to switch back and forth between browser and a text editor.\n\nActually, I think it would be nicer if it were taller and wider.\n\nBut, I am fine w/ leaving the size as long as the POST gets fixed.
