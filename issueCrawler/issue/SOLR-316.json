    "description": "from this thread...\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Slow-facet-with-custom-Analyser-tf4087415.html#a11617565\n\nperhaps we should really have an [f.foo.]facet.field.type=(single|multi)\nparam to let clients indicate when they know exactly which method they\nwnat used (getFacetTermEnumCounts vs getFieldCacheCounts) ... if the\nproperty is not set, the default can be determeined using the\n\"sf.multiValued() || ft.isTokenized() || ft instanceof BoolField\" logic. \n\n...\n\n\nOr a method FieldType.multiToken(), and a new method\nTokenizerFactory/TokenFilterFactory.multiToken() that can be used to\ndetermine this when the FieldType was created (grrr, too bad they\nweren't abstract classes)\n\nOr a new attribute in the schema (but I don't like that solution much)\n\nBut allowing the user to select the strategy has some merit, esp since\nthere will be an additional way to find the top \"n\" when I get around\nto finishing my facet-tree-index code. \n\n...\n\nThanks for the suggestion Chris. I modified SimpleFacets to check for\n[f.foo.]facet.field.type==(single|multi)\nand the performance has been improved significantly.",
