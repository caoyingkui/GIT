    "description": "WildcardTermEnum or FuzzyTermQueryEnum both call setEnum in their constructors. \nInside the superclass, FilteredTermEnum, I find:\n    protected void setEnum(TermEnum actualEnum) throws IOException \n{\n        this.actualEnum = actualEnum;\n        // Find the first term that matches\n        Term term = actualEnum.term();\n        if (termCompare(term))\n            currentTerm = term;\n        else next();\n    }\n\nBecause setEnum is actually called with parameter reader.terms(<some term>), \nthe expression 'actualEnum.term()' could return null. None of the termCompare \nmethods check for a null parameter, and they will throw a null pointer \nexception in that case. I ran into the situation that a wildcard or fuzzy \nsearch in the nonexistent field 'm' would correctly return 0 results, but the \nsame search in the non-existent field 'x' would throw a null pointer exception \nin the correctsponding termCompare method.\nThe following temporary fix in abstract class FilteredTermEnum solved the \nproblem:\n    protected void setEnum(TermEnum actualEnum) throws IOException \n{\n        this.actualEnum = actualEnum;\n        // Find the first term that matches\n        Term term = actualEnum.term();\n        if(term == null) return;      // temporary fix -sjb\n        if (termCompare(term))\n            currentTerm = term;\n        else next();\n    }",
