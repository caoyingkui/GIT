I'll do that and leave a warning in that file that it's left in for this reason so people won't copy it around arbitrarily.\n\nI made my first pass and I'm about to test. One file that I'm not sure of so am leaving alone is uima-fields.xml. It's a fragment of a schema with just the <fields> tag and some <field> child nodes, so it's not proper XML if the <fields> tag is removed. Plus I have no idea how it's really used, I can find no reference to it in the code base at all, even grepping on *.  ",

            "content": "Hmmm, what about \n<defaultSearchField> and <solrQueryParser defaultOperator=\"...\"/>? They've been deprecated since 3.6 so I'd guess the same argument applies. So I guess I'll remove them from most of the schema files but leave them in a couple.\n\nHmm, not sure about this, let me look a bit more. Unlike removing the <fields> and <types> tags, if the code still looks at these it'd change behavior to no good purpose.\n\nNope, not going here. The code still looks at these and uses them, albeit with a warning in managed_schema that it's overridden by 'df' in solrconfig.xml. So taking these out would be A Bad Thing. ",

The defaultSearchField and solrQueryParser tags are still read in the schema and still do something in the absence of , for instance, the \"df\" default param in solrconfig.xml. We'd really have to error out if we found this to insure that people weren't surprised I think... and that's a discussion for another JIRA (7041 as you indicated)... ",
