            "content": "Good catch Dan!\n\nPatch looks good, but I have some comments about the test:\n\n\tYou don't close the directories at the end of it, and the test fails due that.\n\tI think it can be simplified to create just one Directory, with \"f1:content\" and request \"f2:content\". I actually tried it and the test still fails (NPE reproduced without your fix).\n\n\n\nHere is the modified, more compact, test:\n\n  public void testMissingField() throws Exception {\n    // LUCENE-3522: if requested field does not exist in the index, TermsFilter threw NPE.\n    Directory dir = newDirectory();\n    RandomIndexWriter writer = new RandomIndexWriter(random, dir);\n    Document doc = new Document();\n    doc.add(newField(\"f1\", \"content\", StringField.TYPE_STORED));\n    writer.addDocument(doc);\n    IndexReader reader = writer.getReader();\n    writer.close();\n    \n    TermsFilter tf = new TermsFilter();\n    tf.addTerm(new Term(\"f2\", \"content\"));\n    \n    FixedBitSet bits = (FixedBitSet) tf.getDocIdSet(reader.getTopReaderContext().leaves()[0]);\n    assertTrue(\"Must be >= 0\", bits.cardinality() >= 0);      \n    reader.close();\n    dir.close();\n  }\n\n\n\nWould you mind changing the test case to this compact one? Or did you want to demonstrate something else with the two readers? ",
