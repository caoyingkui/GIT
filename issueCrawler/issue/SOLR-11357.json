From the history it appears this was introduced between revisions 32 and 33 during migration of content. This is a fairly critical issue, since these pages appear to be the canonical documentation.",

The official documentation has always been the PDF export:\n\nhttp://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/ref-guide/\n\nAt the top of every page in that website, there is a link to the place where the documentation has moved.  Unlike Confluence, the new system will allow us to have online guides for multiple Solr versions, starting with 6.6:\n\nhttps://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/\n\nWe are working on replacing the broken system so that requests to those URLs are redirected to the current documentation.  It must be set up by another group within Apache, known as Infra.  See INFRA-14849 for that effort.\n\nThe problem appears to be a general issue with Apache's Confluence install.  See INFRA-14971 for another project's documentation that has also been affected. ",
