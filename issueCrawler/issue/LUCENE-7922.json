    "description": "I've been looking at the FST code we have today. Complex to read, even more complex to modify. I think it could benefit if we cleaned it up a bit (there are a few issues out there already that mention this).\n\nThe first baby step would be to remove the \"packed\" representation of FSTs \u2013 I searched the codebase and I don't see a single place where pack would actually be true. The overhead associated with node packing seems to be not worth it in practice (since most FSTs are already fairly small).\n\nIt'd be a breaking API change, but it's probably something worth undertaking for 7.0, unless I'm missing some use cases.",
