    "description": "Sampling of an application which includes a very heavy query load testing against an EmbeddedSolrServer reveals a huge amount of the time spent on initialization of the QueryParser itself, specifically an internal class called LookaheadSuccess which extends from Error. With every instance of QueryParser created, it spends time populating the stacktrace for this object, which is created as a final instance variable (the variable called jj_ls). \n\nIdeally an exception shouldn't be used as a signaling mechanism, or at the very least, not an exception created on every single object instantiation.",

I'm not sure what to make of the 'build.xml' change in this patch.  I applied this patch and ran \"ant javacc\" (observing there was such a target) and it made changes to the CharStream interface (changes we don't want I'm sure; it added methods), and QueryParserTokenManager.java additional unused import statements (which I could easily remove).  Should I not invoke \"ant javacc\"... and simply accept the changes in the patch as good, despite this?  Or maybe the patch needs to do more (though I doubt it). ",
