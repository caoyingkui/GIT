The correct backwards-compatibility of the new API is checked separately by the extra test in LUCENE-1693.\n\nIt is enough if you remove all next() methods, add incrementToken() and make the above mentioned changes to make the token streams final where possible (see the comment of Michael Busch above \u2013 which is the \"howto\" for the conversion).\n\nThe testy should only test the new API, but until they are also converted, the old tests should also still work (because of the backwards-compatibility layer). Be sure to apply LUCENE-1693 which does not change anything in contrib before starting to create a patch to have the newest API. Hopefully Michael has committed 1693 tomorrow.\n\nLUCENE-1460_core.txt is already in LUCENE-1693 as it is part of core token streams. ",
