    "description": "Tried starting a cloud example.  It refused to start as root.  This is a good thing, but the start is acceptable to me for the testing that I will be doing, so I added -force.  It still wouldn't start, probably because the -force option was not transferred to the true start commands.\n\nCommands that I tried:\n\nbin/solr start -e cloud -force\nbin/solr start -force -e cloud",
