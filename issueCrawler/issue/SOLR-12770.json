    "description": "For legacy master/slave clusters, there is no Zookeeper to keep track of all the nodes and shards in the cluster. So users manage the 'shards' parameter manually for\u00a0distributed search. This issue will add the option of configuring a\u00a0list of\u00a0what shards can be requested.\n\nUsers will then get an explicit error response if the request includes a shard which is not in the preconfigured whitelist, e.g. due to a typo. I think all shards logic is handled by HttpShardHandler already so the logic should fit nicely in that one class, configured in solr.xml.",
