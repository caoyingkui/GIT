    "description": "Hi,\n\nI have a requirement where a list of values from a facet field needs to be ordered on custom values. The only option i found was to order by the count for that facet field.\n\nI need something like this:\n\nFacet: Brand\n   Nike (21)\n   Reebok (100)\n   asics (45)\n   Fila (84)\n\nNotice that the facet values are not sorted by count. But instead, sorted by my custom sorting requirement.\nWe want this sorting done in the solr layer rather than the Front end as the requirement keeps changing and we don't want to hard code this sorting in front end.\n\nPlease help. Is this possible to do?",
