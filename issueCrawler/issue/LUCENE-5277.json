    "description": "FixedBitSet copy constructor is redundant the way it is now \u2013 one can call FBS.clone() to achieve that (and indeed, no code in Lucene calls this ctor). I think it will be useful to add a numBits parameter to that method to allow growing/shrinking the new bitset, while copying all relevant bits from the passed one.",

I think it's ok to not deprecate this ctor and add another one since it's not used in Lucene code, and I imagine it's quite expert to do + there's an easy alternative (call clone()). We can also add size() to return numBits (actually I think it's useful to add that anyway?) ",

            "content": "I thought of that ... it started in LUCENE-5248 where I want to keep a growable bitset alongside the docs/values arrays to mark whether a document has an updated value or not (following Rob's idea). When I implemented that using OpenBitSet, I discovered the bug and opened LUCENE-5272. As I worked on fixing the bug, I realized OBS has other issues as well and thought that perhaps I can use FixedBitSet, only grow it by copying its array. This is doable even without the ctor, since I can call getBits() and do it like that:\n\n\nFixedBitSet newBits = new FixedBitSet(17); // new capacity\nSystem.arraycopy(oldBits.getBits(), 0, newBits.getBits(), 0, oldBits.getBits().length);\n\n\n\nI then noticed there is a ctor already in FixedBitSet which copies another FBS so I thought just to improve it. It seems more intuitive to do t than let users figure out they can grow a FixedBitSet like above? ",
