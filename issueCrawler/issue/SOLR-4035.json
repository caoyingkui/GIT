    "description": "The edismax query parser is much more than a parser of queries, a disjunction maximizer or the sum of those parts. Some users may wish to use, for example, its field level approach to boosting, but may not desire the dismax scoring, preferring the interpolated score of a boolean OR.\n\nThe ExtendedDismaxQueryParserPlugin is already able to produce such boolean queries, when ExtendedSolrQueryParser.makeDismax == false. This should be exposed as a query parameter.",
