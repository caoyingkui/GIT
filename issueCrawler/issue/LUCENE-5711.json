            "content": "Note that this was changed in LUCENE-1763. At the time there were issues with some MPs that didn't treat it well, but I don't remember what issues. It also helped clean up the API, since I think most apps don't share an MP between writers. But then again, most people also don't write their own MPs, or interact with it directly, so the API is less of an issue. If it works and allows to share an MP between writers more easily, let's go for it. ",
