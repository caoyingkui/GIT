    "description": "When invoking a facet function in the JSON Facet API, TrieDateField is coerced into a numeric value and the result of the function is emitted as numeric instead of being converted back into a formatted date.\n\nExample:\n\ncurl http://localhost:8983/solr/query?q=*:*&json.facet=\n{most_recent:'max(modified)'}\n\nProduces (in part):\n\n\"facets\":{\n  \"count\":38304,\n  \"most_recent\":1.489012400831E12}}\n\nThe \"most_recent\" attribute would be more useful if it was converted back to an iso8601 formatted date.\n\nThere was a thread discussing this issue in 2016: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/min-max-on-date-fields-using-JSON-facets-td4288736.html#a4288781",
