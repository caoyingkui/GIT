            "content": "\n\tAdded setNextReader to CategoryListIterator (instead of init()) and Aggregator.\n\n\n\n\n\tModified StandardFacetsAccumulator to iterate of the segment's atomic readers and call setNextReader accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\tFixed an issue in ScoredDocIdsUtils where it assumed ScoredDocIDs are OpenBitSet where for a long time they are FixedBitSet. This caused unnecessary copy from FixedBitSet to OpenBitSet.\n\n\n\n\n\tMost of the other changes are API changes, i.e. createCategoryListIterator no longer takes an IndexReader etc.\n\n\n\nI didn't add yet a CHANGES line because I'm not sure if this will make it into 4.1. Basically it's ready to go in (all tests pass), so I'll check later today what's the status of the 4.1 branch and decide accordingly.\n\nThis now makes the cutover to DocValues even easier. That's what I'd like to do next. ",
