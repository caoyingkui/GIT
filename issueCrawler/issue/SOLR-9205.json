    "description": "LukeRequestHandler (/admin/luke) lists schema flags using two fields named \"schema\" and \"flags\".\n\nFor instance on my local machine http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/admin/luke returns something like this:\n\n<lst name=\"id\">\n  <str name=\"type\">string</str>\n  <str name=\"schema\">I-S-----OF-----l</str>\n</lst>\n\n\nAnd http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/admin/luke?show=schema returns something like this:\n\n<lst name=\"id\">\n  <str name=\"type\">string</str>\n  <str name=\"flags\">I-S-----OF-----l</str>\n</lst>\n\n\n\nHowever, when processing a LukeRequest in SolrJ, only the \"flags\" field is parsed into a Set of FieldFlag objects. The \"schema\" field is left as a String, and as a result is hard to process by client applications who do not know how to parse \"I-S----OF----l\".\n\nHere is an example that illustrates the problem:\n\npublic class MyClass {\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n    SolrClient client = new HttpSolrClient(\"http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1\");\n    LukeRequest request = new LukeRequest();\n    LukeResponse response = request.process(client);\n    for (LukeResponse.FieldInfo field:response.getFieldInfo().values()) {\n      System.out.println(field.getSchema());\n      // field.getSchema() returns \"I-S-----OF------\" (i.e. a String) which is not much meaningful for SolrJ applications\n      // Ideally field.getSchema() should return something like \"[INDEXED, STORED, OMIT_NORMS, OMIT_TF]\" (i.e. a EnumSet<FieldFlag>) which is meaningful for SolrJ applications\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIt is probably fine to parse both fields the same way in SolrJ since LukeRequestHandler populates them the same way.",
