From https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-Admin/:\n\n\nHow to re-trigger patch testing for an issue:\n\nThe easiest way to rerun testing of a patch is to upload a new patch (with the same filename is fine) to the same Jira. The combination of a Jira being in Patch Available state AND having a new attachment that has never been processed by this system is what will trigger a new test of the patch. ",
