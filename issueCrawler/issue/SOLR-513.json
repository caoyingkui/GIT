            "content": "I've had a look at this again. As far as I can see, there's no way to get the pathPrefix in the jsp without jumping through some major hoops. Therefore I've decided to try a different approach.\n\nInstead of changing the links in index.jsp I've changed the included _info.jsp to redirect requests to /solr/admin/ to /solr/coreName/admin/. This also makes it explicit which core is used.\n\nI personally think that the default behaviour of randomly picking a core when none is specified in a multicore configuration should be changed to showing an error message or specifying a default core in the multicore configuration. I don't think that the current behaviour should be supported in the future as you can't be sure which core will be selected and it's therefore a potential source of errors. Also it's using a deprecated method to get a core.\n\nAttaching patch which makes the necessary changes to _info.jsp. Tested with multicore configuration on Tomcat and single core configuration on Jetty. "
