    "description": "When caching tokens, the helper TokenStreams in analysis.jsp and AnalysisRequestHandlerBase do not clear all attributes.\nThe issue is tricky. The cached tokens do not contain all attributes in early stages, so copyTo() does not necessarily overwrite all attributes in \"this\". Calling clearAttributes ensures this.\n\nWas: LUCENE-2901 broke protected words by only setting and never clearing (that change should have been accompanied by offsetting code to clear the attribute somewhere).\n\nThe problem here was, that this attribute was added later in anaylsis chain, so cached tokens don't include this. Sorry, that was my fault when rewriting analysis.jsp together with Robert",
