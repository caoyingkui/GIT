    "description": "My recent poll of solr users shows that people are ready for a solr face lift. The majority of of those who answered were looking for an improvement, while a slightly lesser number voted for a complete redesign. Lets not shoot for the moon though- lets see if we can't at least just improve things a bit to start.\n\nI am not a graphics design dude - but to get things started, here is a new solr-admin.css file that I think is at least an improvement to what we have. My hope is that some talented people out there will show up my lowly skills, but if those people can not be found, I think even a slow move in a better direction is worthwhile.\n\nComments, criticisms, discussion - please! I am willing to pitch in in whatever way I can to help to improve this UI, so speak up if you have any ideas.\n\n\n\tMark",
