            "content": "Let's consider why co-locating documents with the same group works.\n\nThe easiest way to co-locate is to have all documents on one shard:\n\n\"shard1\" : [ { \"family\":\"A\" ... } ... {\"family\":\"N\", \"state\":\"nj\", ... }, {\"family\":\"N\", \"state\":\"ny\", ... } ... { \"family\":\"Z\" ... } ]\n# 26 groups [A ... Z] overall\n\n\n\nAlternatively, across multiple shards, documents with the same group can be co-located e.g. \"nj\" and \"ny\" in group/family \"N\" on shard2:\n\n\"shard1\" : [ { \"family\":\"A\" ... } ...                                                                        ... { \"family\":\"Y\" ... } ]\n\"shard2\" : [ { \"family\":\"B\" ... } ... {\"family\":\"N\", \"state\":\"nj\", ... }, {\"family\":\"N\", \"state\":\"ny\", ... } ... { \"family\":\"Z\" ... } ]\n# shard1 has 13 groups, shard2 has 13 groups, overall we have 13+13=26 groups\n\n\n\nLastly, if documents with the same group are not co-located ...\n\n# documents distributed across (say) two shards with documents in the same group _not_ co-located on the same shard\n\"shard1\" : [ { \"family\":\"A\" ... } ... {\"family\":\"N\", \"state\":\"nj\", ... } ... { \"family\":\"Y\" ... } ]\n\"shard2\" : [ { \"family\":\"B\" ... } ... {\"family\":\"N\", \"state\":\"ny\", ... } ... { \"family\":\"Z\" ... } ]\n# shard1 has 14 groups [A C E G I K M  N  O Q S U W Y]\n# shard2 has 13 groups [B D F H J L    N  P R T V X Z]\n# overall:\n# approximate result: shard1 has 14 groups, shard2 has 13 groups, overall we have approximately 14+13=27 groups\n# accurate result: intersect([A C E G I K M N O Q S U W Y],[B D F H J L N P R T V X Z]) = [A ... Z] = 26 groups\n\n\n... then the calculation of accurate group counts would be expensive, requiring intersection of the A...N...Y and B...N...Z lists.\n\nI am not aware of any plans to change the existing behaviour.
