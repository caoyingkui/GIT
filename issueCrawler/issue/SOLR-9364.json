    "description": "As part of SOLR-6465, I wrote a chaos monkey style test which ultimately shows wrong doc count on target clusters. This test starts indexing threads on source and while they are running restarts the shard leader on the target cluster repeatedly. I reverted all of the changes in SOLR-6465 and the test still reproduces the problem on stock CDCR code.",
