    "description": "MemoryIndex skips tokens that have length == 0 when building the index; the result is that it does not increment the token offset (nor does it store the position offsets if that option is set) for tokens of length == 0.  A regular index (via, say, RAMDirectory) does not appear to do this.\n\nWhen using the ICUFoldingFilter, it is possible to have a term of zero length (the \\u0640 character separated by spaces).  If that occurs in a document, the offsets returned at search time differ between the MemoryIndex and a regular index.",

I dont agree with the unicode property of \"letter\" for this character as that doesnt makes sense to me, in my opinion it should be \"format\". I sure hope there is some good reason for this, but to me its crazy. ",
