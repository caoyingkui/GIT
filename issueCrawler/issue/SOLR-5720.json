    "description": "This ticket introduces a new search component called the ExpandComponent. The expand component expands a single page of results collapsed by the CollapsingQParserPlugin.\n\nSample syntax:\n\nq=*:*&fq={!collapse field=fieldA}&expand=true&expand.sort=fieldB+asc&expand.rows=10\n\n\nIn the above query the results are collapsed on \"fieldA\" with the CollapsingQParserPlugin. The expand component expands the current page of collapsed results.\n\nThe initial implementation of the ExpandComponent takes three parameters:\n\nexpand=true (Turns on the ExpandComponent)\nexpand.sort=fieldB+asc,fieldC+desc (Sorts the documents based on a sort spec. If none is specified the documents are sorted by relevance based on the main query.)\nexpand.rows=10 (Sets the numbers of rows that groups are expanded to).",

The documents within the groups are ordered SolrDocumentList, but the groups themselves are designed to be referenced by group name from the main collapsed result list. So, applications will iterate the main collapsed result list and lookup the expanded groups in the expanded Map.\n\nAlso beefed up the distributed test cases.\n\n\n "
