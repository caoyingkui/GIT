    "description": "StemmerOverrideFilter is configured with an FST-based map that you can build at construction time from a list of entries.  Building this FST offline and loading it directly as a bytestream makes construction a lot quicker, but you can't do that conveniently at the moment as all the methods of StemmerOverrideMap are package-private.",

Maybe because it's not defining the generic parameter on Arc?  Anybody have any ideas, apart from changing the javadoc from a link var to a code var? ",
