The admin analyzer says that outputUnigramIfNoNgram=true\n\norg.apache.solr.analysis.ShingleFilterFactory \n{outputUnigrams=false, outputUnigramIfNoNgram=true}\n\nHowever, this does not seem to be getting set within the ShingleFilter and the admin analyzer shows nothing coming out of the ShingleFilterFactory when analyzing a query with a single word.\nwhen using the admin interface to query a single word, I also get no results.\n\nIf I hack the patch by always setting outputUnigramsIfNoNgrams to true, everything works fine.\n(see below)\n\nIf I am missing something or obviously doing something wrong, please let me know.  In the meantime I will try to write a unit test and track down the problem.  Is there an already existing unit test I could use as a model?\n\nTom Burton-West\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHack \n\npublic void init(Map<String, String> args) \n{\n    super.init(args);\n    maxShingleSize = getInt(\"maxShingleSize\", \n                            ShingleFilter.DEFAULT_MAX_SHINGLE_SIZE);\n    outputUnigrams = getBoolean(\"outputUnigrams\", true);\n    outputUnigramIfNoNgrams = true; \n   /** tbw lets always set it to true above\n    * comment out the original code below\n    getBoolean(\"outputUnigramIfNoNgram\", false);\n    **/\n  } "

            "content": "Tom,\n\nThe Lucene half of this patch pair adds unit tests to src/test/org/apache/lucene/analysis/shingle/ShingleFilterTest.java. Do those tests pass when you run them on your custom lucene build, after applying LUCENE-1370? (cd to the top-level of lucene and then run \"ant test -Dtestcase=ShingleFilterTest\".) I didn't add any tests for the Solr half of the patch pair, but I also don't know how you would test it in a productive manner. "

It turns out that  we had a configuration error that left an unpatched version of ShingleFilter on the classpath when Solr started up.  Once we made sure that the patched version was loading, everything has been working  just fine.\n\nTom "
