    "description": "I would like to sort my documents by the date of their last modification. Each\ndocument has a field called \"last-modified\". The values of this field look like\n\"yyyyMMddHHmm\", e.g. \"200408081530\" for 2004/08/08 15:30.\n\nTo the searching process itself, I created a sort object and searched the index\n\nSort sort = new Sort(new SortField[]\n{new SortField(\"last-modified\", true)}\n);\nHits hits = searcher.search(query, sort);\n\nBut the order of the document is not as expected, e.g. I get\n\n1. 200408170345\n2. 200408022206\n3. 200407302321\n4. 200408030456\n\nI also tried to use\n\nSort sort = new Sort(new SortField[]\n{new SortField(\"last-modified\",\nSortField.STRING, true)}\n);\n\nbut this changed the order to\n\n1. 200408170345\n2. 200407302321\n3. 200408030456\n4. 200408022206\n\nwhich is again not what I expected.",

The problem\nwas that the dates were saved \"yyyyMMddHHmmss\", but I printed them out as\n\"yyyyMMddHHmm\" and the date formatter was converting the strings wrongly so that\nthey were different from the actual ones.\n\nThank you for your quick answers.
