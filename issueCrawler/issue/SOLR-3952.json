    "description": "Since we have full control over what is stored in our indexes, we want to retrieve highlighted terms or phrases in \"real\" XML-tags ...\n\n\n<str>\n <em>Napoleon</em> \n</str>\n\n\n\n... rather than in escaped sequences:\n\n\n<str>\n &lt;em&gt;Napoleon&lt;/em&gt; \n</str>\n\n\n\nUntil now I haven't discovered any solution to solve this problem out-of-the-box. We patched together a very crude workaround involving Cocoon's ServletService, a XSLT-stylesheet and disableOutputEscaping=\"yes\". \n\nTherefore this patch provides:\n\n\n\ta field doEscape in TextResponseWriter and corresponding getters/setters\n\tsupport for a request-parameter \"escape=off\" to disable escaping\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I have chosen the optimal approach to address this issue or if the issue is even a issue. Maybe there is a better way with Formatters/Encoders or something else?",
