    "description": "omitTF is viral. if you add document 1 with field \"foo\" as omitTF, then document 2 has field \"foo\" without omitTF, they are both treated as omitTF.\n\nbut omitNorms is the opposite. if you have a million documents with field \"foo\" with omitNorms, then you add just one document without omitting norms, \nnow you suddenly have a million 'real norms'.\n\nI think it would be good for omitNorms to be viral too, just for consistency, and also to prevent huge byte[]'s.\nbut another option is to make omitTF anti-viral, which is more \"schemaless\" i guess.",

The fact that norms are dense, on disk and in memory, can cause horrific problems like your index taking much much more disk space and RAM on optimize/big merge finishing.\n\nBut I think that's orthogonal to the improvements here?  Ie this issue removes fake norms, invalid uses of default Sim, etc.\n\nAlso, I would worry about the lookup cost of sparse vectors in RAM \u2013 looking up the norm per doc is a severe hotspot on Lucene.

I am totally not trying to address\nthis here. This one is just about cleaning up things that are \"buggy\", especially using Similarity.getDefault when we shouldn't.\n\nThe scope of this one (even though its just cleanup) is large enough I think... I'd like to proceed with this unless there are\nany objections. We can address real improvements to norms somewhere else, and hopefully this will help make that easier. ",
