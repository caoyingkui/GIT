If the document is not present in the shard, no \"interesting terms\" are found and, consequently, no matches are found.\n\nSteps to reproduce\n\n\n\tEdit example/solr/collection1/conf/solrconfig.xml and add this line, with the rest of the request handlers:\n\n\n\n\n<requestHandler name=\"/mlt\" class=\"solr.MoreLikeThisHandler\" />\n\n\n\n\n\tFollow the simplest SolrCloud example to get two shards running.\n\tHit this URL: http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/mlt?mlt.fl=includes&q=id:3007WFP&mlt.match.include=false&mlt.interestingTerms=list&mlt.mindf=1&mlt.mintf=1\n\tCompare that output to that of this URL: http://localhost:7574/solr/collection1/mlt?mlt.fl=includes&q=id:3007WFP&mlt.match.include=false&mlt.interestingTerms=list&mlt.mindf=1&mlt.mintf=1\n\n\n\nThe former URL will return a result and list some interesting terms. The latter URL will return no results and list no interesting terms. It will also show this odd XML element:\n\n\n<null name=\"response\"/>",
