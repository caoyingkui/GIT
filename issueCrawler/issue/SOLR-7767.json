Off the top of my head that would include Graph and ZK Status.  Make it a red downward pointing triangle, a yellow square, or a green upward pointing triangle.  If we want to get fancy, it can have 3D shading.  Red would be used if ALL the top-level statuses are not green or at least one of them is red.  Yellow would be used if red status has not been discovered and any top-level statuses in the tab detail are not green.  I wonder if that also needs an auto-refresh checkbox that can re-check the status with ajax every 30 seconds or so and change the icon if the status changes.\n\nEdit: Just came across information saying that 7.5 has a Nodes tab now.
