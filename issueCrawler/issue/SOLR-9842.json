I'm playing around with this in a patch for another issue.",

            "content": "Yeah I guess AutoClosable is now preferred.\n\nI had thought about deprecating finish, but I wasn't sure it was easy to have the tolerant processor work correctly with a single final method. In the end it seemed simpler to keep considering finish as containing logic that is part of the request - failures are captured by the tolerant processor and close as just for releasing resources - if releasing a resource fails, log an issue, but don't consider the request as having been unsuccessful.\n\nIf you have an idea though, let me know.
