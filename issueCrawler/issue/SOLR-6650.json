    "description": "At super high request rates, logging all the requests can become a bottleneck and therefore INFO logging is often turned off. However, it is still useful to be able to set a latency threshold above which a request is considered \"slow\" and log that request at WARN level so we can easily identify slow queries.",

I can turn off INFO logging, set a threshold, and chances are good that whatever I need to look at is something that will be logged, but the file will not be clogged with every request.\n\nMy look at the patch was very quick, so I have not noticed every detail.  It looks like this defaults to enabled with a threshold of 1 second.  If that's the case, I don't think that's a good idea.  It should default to disabled.\n\nHopefully it will log all queries if I set the threshold to zero.  A negative number in the setting (or the setting not present) would be a good way to turn it off. Will this only log queries, or would it log all slow requests, including calls to /update? ",
