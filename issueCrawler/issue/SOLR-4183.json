When I use DataImport with the clean=true parameter, the other nodes in my cluster are emptied (and committed) before the indexing is complete.\n\nWhen working with just one node, I thought that it always waited to commit and delete until everything was imported.\n\nApologies if my understanding was incorrect.",
