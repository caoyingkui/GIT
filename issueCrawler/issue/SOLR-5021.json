    "description": "SOLR-4977 added an awesome new LoggingInfoStream class, and wisely it does not output \"TP\" category messages because it logs everything at the INFO level \u2013 but we could improve this to log TP messages at the TRACE level (and check if TRACE is enabled when ased if isEnabled(\"TP\").\n\nThat way people who do/don't want to see all the TP messages could control that based on whether the LoggingInfoStream logger level was set to allow/filter TRACE level log messages.",

See LUCENE-5039 for what i mean.\n\nSo i discarded them (also for lucene tests!), because otherwise, infostream is useless when working with unit tests.\n\nBottom line, i dont think anyone (humans or machines) want to see TP messages, only lucene's TestIndexWriterExceptions "

It seems like it could be handy, when trying to track down problems in Solr tests, to be able to see the testPoint asserts in the logs \u2013 interleaved with other debug log messages from Solr.\n\nI realize this would be very verbose, hence i'm not suggesting we do it at INFO or even DEBUG, but i'm not understanding why it would be bad to allow them to be logged at TRACE?
