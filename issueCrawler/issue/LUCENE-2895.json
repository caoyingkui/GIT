    "description": "When working on LUCENE-2891 (on trunk), I found out that if MockRandomCodec is used, then setting IWC.readerTermsIndexDivisor to -1 allows seeking e.g., termDocs, when it shouldn't. Other Codecs fail to seek, as expected by the test. We need to find out why MockRandomCodec does not fail as expected.\n\nTo verify that, run \"ant test-core -Dtestcase=TestIndexWriterReader -Dtestmethod=testNoTermsIndex -Dtests.codec=MockRandom\", but comment out the line which adds MockRandom to the list of illegal codecs in the test.",
