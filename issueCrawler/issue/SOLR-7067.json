See the first answer to this StackOverflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/592620/check-if-a-program-exists-from-a-bash-script.\n\nCan somebody do a sanity check on OS X 10.10.1 and other Unix-ish platforms?  I'll check on Debian (not sure what version I have ATM) in a minute.\n\nI want to get this into 5.0. ",
