    "description": "Hello!\n\nIf noticed some strange problems of the german analyzer when using field search \nfor texts consisting of more than one word. For example, I had to documents in \nthe search index, one had a field set to \"Anfrage von mir\", the other one had \nit set to \"Ticket von mir\". While the search for \"fieldname:anfrage\" returned \nthe expected document, \"fieldname:ticket\" did not return the document. After \nremoving the special treatment of upper case words in the GermanStemmer, it \nworked properly.\n\nAll the best\nPhilipp",

What it does: \n\nGermanAnalyzer.java: \n-use LowerCaseFilter \n-Hashtable -> HashSet, deprecate the old methods \n\nGermanStemmer.java: \n-no special handling for uppercase words, this confuses people more than it helps \n\nWordListLoader: \n-avoid silent failure for null filenames \n-trim() the lines from the stopword file \n-simplify implementation, using HashSet add instead of array copying \n-add a TODO: this isn't specific for German, should be moved \n\nI hope this can be applied before 1.4 is released. \n ",

Before I apply it, could you please explain to me why it\nis okay to ignore upper/lower case characters for a German language stemmer?\nNouns are upper-cased in German, so wouldn't the case have a special meaning to\nconsider before stemming a word?\n\nFurthermore, would you happen to know whether this GermanStemmer is superior or\ndifferent than the 2 Snowball stemmers for German?\n\nThanks.

So unless you've got a sophisticated \nsentence boundary detection you cannot conclude that a word is a noun just because \nit starts with an uppercase character. \n\nComment #2 had an example: \"\u00c3\u00a4hnelt\" (a verb) vs. \"\u00c3\u0084hnelt\" (the same verb, but \nappearing at the beginning of a sentence \u2013 which is okay). \n\nI didn't have a closer look at the Snowball stemmers, so I cannot comment on that. \n ",
