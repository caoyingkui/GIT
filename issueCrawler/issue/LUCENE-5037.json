I can test them by ssh'ing into the machine (only when its actually running a jenkins job, otherwise its down!) and trying to run the test with any patches/ideas.",

I can't yet ssh into the machine until it starts a jenkins job to test it though \n\nIn ReplicatorTestCase.java, the server is explicitly started on 127.0.0.1:\n\n    connector.setHost(\"127.0.0.1\");\n\n\n\nHowever, the code connecting tries to connect to \"localhost\". This is inconsistent: If this os X jvm has ipv6 configured, it could very likely be trying to connect to ::1, which won't be listening! ",

            "content": "And I'm guessing the only reason it fails with 1.6 is due to some difference in resolver behavior or v6/v4 preference in the stack, because by default localhost has something like this on os X:\n\n\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost \nfe80::1%lo0     localhost\n\n\n\nSo if its doing round-robin, the test would fail 2/3 of the time. but if java7 is using order, it would never fail because it would always use 127.0.0.1 first.
