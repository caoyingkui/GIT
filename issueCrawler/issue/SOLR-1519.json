            "content": "Please ask such questions on the solr-user mailing list before creating an issue.\n\nThe answer to your question is that distributed search fetches start+rows documents (just unique keys + scores) from each shard in order to correctly merge the results. This is why it gets slower as you keep on increasing the start value. "
