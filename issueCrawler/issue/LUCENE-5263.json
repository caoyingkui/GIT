    "description": "This case is tricky to handle, yet I think realistic: disk fills up\ntemporarily, causes an exception in writeLiveDocs, and then the app\nkeeps using the IW instance.\n\nMeanwhile disk later frees up again, IW is closed \"successfully\".  In\ncertain cases, we can silently lose deletes in this case.\n\nI had already committed\nTestIndexWriterDeletes.testNoLostDeletesOnDiskFull, and Jenkins seems\nhappy with it so far, but when I added fangs to the test (cutover to\nRandomIndexWriter from IndexWriter, allow IOE during getReader, add\nrandomness to when exc is thrown, etc.), it uncovered some real/nasty\nbugs:\n\n\n\tReaderPool.dropAll was suppressing any exception it hit, because\n    \n\nif (priorE != null)\n\n should instead be \n\nif (priorE == null)\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAfter a merge, we have to write deletes before committing the\n    segment, because an exception when writing deletes means we need\n    to abort the merge\n\n\n\n\n\tSeveral places that were directly calling deleter.checkpoint must\n    also increment the changeCount else on close IW thinks there are\n    no changes and doesn't write a new segments file.\n\n\n\n\n\tcloseInternal was dropping pooled readers after writing the\n    segments file, which would lose deletes still buffered due to a\n    previous exc.",

I use it in two other places already.\n\n\n\n\n\tIn ReaderPool.release: why don't you call writer.checkpoint()? It calls both deleter.checkpoint() and increments changed++. Did you want to avoid it also notifying sis.changed()? If so, maybe drop a comment why we don't do it?\n\t\n\t\tIf you choose to keep the code like that, there's a place in release() which calls deleter then increments changeCount, where in all other places the order is reverse. Maybe change it to be consistent? I don't know if it's an issue that changeCount isn't incremented, if e.g. deleter.checkpoint throws an ex?\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSeparately, I think it will be a useful utility to have a method like Utils.throwEx(Throwable t) which does the \"if instanceof\" logic (checking for IOE, RuntimeE, Error etc.).\n\n\n\nOtherwise looks good!

So maybe change the issue's description (and also the CHANGES entry text)?\n\nI'll fix the issue description, and I added a CHANGES.txt entry.\n\nIn TestIndexWriterReader I see this:\n\nYes, this is intentional (it was helpful debugging to see exactly\nwhere I broke r2.isCurrent()).\n\nYou think maybe we should move FakeIOE to MDW so that other tests can use it?\n\nI moved it, and shared from TestIndexWriterReader.java and\nTestIndexWriterDelete.java.\n\nIn ReaderPool.release: why don't you call writer.checkpoint()?\n\nRight, I needed to increment changeCount (so that the writer writes a\nnew segments file), plus checkpoint with IFD (so it knows about the\nnew .del file) but NOT increment SIS.version (because there was in\nfact no \"actual\" change to the index contents, just moving state from\nRAM to disk).  I put a comment explaining this, and also factored out\na new method.\n\nSeparately, I think it will be a useful utility to have a method like Utils.throwEx(Throwable t)\n\nGood idea!  I factored that out.\n\nI think you can move the newIWC call to inside the 'if (w == null)'.\n\nOK I fixed that.\n\nI implemented the TODO about sub-classing CMS. Perhaps you'll want to include that in your patch as well:\n\nI folded this in too ... thanks!\n\nAlso, separately, I managed to re-attach the fang I previously removed\nfrom testThreadInterruptDeadlock/testTwoThreadsInterruptDeadlock, by\nfixing IW.ReaderPool.dropAll to throw any exceptions it hits when save\nis true, rather than suppressing them and dropping all readers from\nthe pool.  I think there was another bug lurking there, because the\npool would lose changes previously if an exc was hit writing deletes\non close, and the app then called close again, and it succeeded.\n\nI also fixed a few tests to clean up their static fields ... they were\nsometimes angry during distributed beasting!
