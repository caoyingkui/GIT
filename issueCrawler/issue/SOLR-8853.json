No value for mm is set in solr configuration.\nE.g. \n\nfl:(java OR book)\n\n is parsed to \n\n\"+((fl:java fl:book)~2)\"\n\nWhen the query has explicit OR then why the ~2 (I think due to mm being set to 100%) is present in the parsed query?\n\nHow can I achieve following?\n\"+((fl:java fl:book))\"\n\nPlease help in understanding if it is intentional or is there a way to achieve the desired search or is it a bug?",
