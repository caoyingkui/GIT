            "content": "Hi, Christine.  I think the issue you noticed here is the subject of    \nSOLR-5878.  My diagnosis is that when group.format=simple in a          \ndistributed search, the value of 'rows' is interpreted as the number    \nof groups to be represented in the result set rather than as the        \nnumber of documents to be returned.  I've added another failing unit    \ntest to your patch where the result set is smaller so that it's easier  \nto see what's happening: rows=9 and group.limit=2, and the 9th group    \nreturned contains 2 docs, so a total of 10 docs are returned.
