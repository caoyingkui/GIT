When you do, you need to include enough information for us to have some idea what behavior you're seeing, what you've tried, perhaps sample data and the like.\n\nIt's very unlikely that any code changes will be done that affect the 4.x code line so unless a problem can be demonstrated in much more recent Solr releases this will not be addressed.
