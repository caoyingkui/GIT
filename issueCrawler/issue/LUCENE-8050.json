    "description": "Since LUCENE-7456 (Lucene 6.3), PerFieldDocValuesFormat delegates the merge to the actual field DVF's merge.  Great, but unfortunately it will call getDocValuesFormatForField on all fields (in FieldInfos) even those that have no DocValues (DocValuesType.NONE).  It won't ultimately actually write anything to those DVFs but there may be some overhead and furthermore it's now more awkward to write a subclass of PFDVF that deliberately throws an exception from getDocValuesFormatForField for some fields.\n\nAFAICT this appears to be a non-issue for PerFieldPostingsFormat's merge because it's use of MultiFields filters out IndexOptions.NONE",
