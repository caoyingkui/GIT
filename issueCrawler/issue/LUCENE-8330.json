I never understood the crazy info.info.dir == writer.getDirectory() from before, but i didn't have the time to change it to an assert and see why its really needed from tests.  At least if its really needed, the javadocs of the interface should explain enough so we understand why it has this crazy check. \n\nIn general though, the cleanup will be great for tests. ",
