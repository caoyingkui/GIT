    "description": "Currently there is no way to perform a delta import per entity because ${dataimporter.last_index_time} really represents the entire delta-import for all entities and is only a single dataimport.properties file.\n\nA delta-import w/ dataimport?command=delta-import&entity=a and dataimport?command=delta-import&entity=b should result in:\n\n${dataimporter.[name of entity].last_index_time}\n${dataimporter.[name of entity].last_index_time}\n\nI do this now because I have a single multicore representing different docs coming from different entities.",
