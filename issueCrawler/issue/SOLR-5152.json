    "description": "I am using EdgeNGramFilterFactory in my schema.xml\n\n\n<fieldType name=\"text\" class=\"solr.TextField\" positionIncrementGap=\"100\">\n  <analyzer type=\"index\">\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <filter class=\"solr.EdgeNGramFilterFactory\" minGramSize=\"2\" maxGramSize=\"10\" side=\"front\" />\n  </analyzer>\n</fieldType>\n\n\nSome tokens in my index only consist of one character, let's say R. minGramSize is set to 2 and is bigger than the length of the token. I expected the NGramFilter to left R unchanged but in fact it is deleting the token.\n\nFor my use case this interpretation is undesirable, and probably for most use cases too!?",

            "content": "I've adapted Furkan's patch to solr 5.0.0 (it applies to 5.3.1 too). preserveOriginal works fine for me with 5.0.0.\nJust one thing - since EdgeNGramFilterFactory doesn't update offsets anymore, ant throws an error about UpdateOffsets, so I simply removed this if-else block. After that solr compiles fine, but may be this part of code should be changed somehow smarter.\nAnd thanks a lot, Furkan. "
