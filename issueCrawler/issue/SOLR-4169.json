Back then, we didnt check for directories not being closed, we didnt run tests in parallel, tests ran once a day, we didn't have an awesome test framework that failed based on all these things.\n\nSo before, most of what randomly fails now, would not even have failed before.\n\nThe original coders for a lot of the tests and code failing had moved on to other things. It's taken time to slowly harden everything. SolrCloud and its jetty based tests introduced a new layer.\n\nMeanwhile, I do a lot of solr development and i find the tests very useful. If you need some help, please, ask me and I can lend you hand. \n\nThe tests have made great strides - I and a couple others are reducing the failures all the time. Sometimes they flair up due to some change or mix of changes - currently that is happening due to a couple issues that are well documented and attended to on the list. Real issues that need to be dealt with.\n\nThe random fails are not usually test issues - but nor are they always critical issues. In fact, most involve shutdown - an area we just have not cared a great deal about in Solr in the past. So what if shutdown wasnt perfect. SolrCloud changes that a bit.\n\nAnyhow, I put a lot of effort into improving the tests, and I know I've made a lot of ground, and will continue to do so. There are a lot of challenges. Like I said, Ive been in the Lucene world too, and the nature of it being a library without jetty or large integration tests really made it an breeze in comparison. Lucene also is lucky enough to have more people that are test fanatics at the moment. "

And every Lucene/Solr committer should try to fix at least one Solr test to get the taste of how complex those tests are  These aren't necessarily regressions \u2013 they're existing weak spots uncovered by more rigorous test sandbox rules. \n\nThis said, I still think it'd be nice if we could somehow disable those tests that we know produce a lot of noise and only enable them on a build plan that would run with a specific e-mail prefix or with an entire different e-mail sink. Once somebody  decides they're ok to be included in all plans they can do so; if builds start to fail again \u2013 switch them back to the \"unstable\" zone. Much like in-progress branches, really. "
