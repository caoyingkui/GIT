            "content": "OK, this patch adds a DocSet.getTopFilter that returns a lucene Filter that will work for the reader the DocSet was generated with, or any of it's sub-readers (as Lucene now does per-segment searching and filtering).\n\nSortedIntDocSet has optimizations for when segments are sorted in order.  It also looks up the end index once instead of comparing to the max value on every next() or skipTo()\n\nI plan on committing shortly. "
