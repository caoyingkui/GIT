The old MultiSearcher did exactly do this. This is why it returns Comparable<?>. So instead FieldComparator.compare(a, b) just use a.compareTo(b). It's in the responsibility of the Comparator to return a correctly wrapped Comparable.\n\nThere might only be a bug in RelevanceComparator: Its getValue() method returns a comparable that sorts in wrong order. We have no test for this, so it might never cause a test failure. ",

But as far as I know, there was/is already some special case in the collectors merge code used to merge segment's results (FieldValueHitQueue.fillFields copys the values into the collected docs, but I am not sure if this is still used.\n\nThe good old deprecated FieldDocSortedHitQueue in 3.x (what's the replacement?) contains this special case:\n\n\n} else {\n  c = docA.fields[i].compareTo(docB.fields[i]);\n  if (type == SortField.SCORE) {\n    c = -c;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn trunk it's gone, so we can maybe fix this stupidness.

The indexes in fact have segments. The problem was that I was irritated by the former MultiSearcher code that used these compareValues() code. In trunk, only TopDocs.merge() does this.\n\nSo I changed the test:\n\n\tIt does not use MatchAllDocsQuery, instead two TermRangeQueries with a random center point, so it splits the index into two parts. Each result is sorted and checked that its valid.\n\tWith the two result sets it calls TopDocs.merge() and again checks the result. This call will invoke the value methods and here the test fails as Robert said.\n\tFor each search call it does not always set the maximum number of docs as PQ size (else compareBottom/setBottom) are not tested. It reduces the PQ size to a fraction of numDocs for all searches.\n\n\n\nIn general we should add similar tests to all custom comparators in Lucene's code, because the comparator can only be tested completely if you also check merging TopDocs.
