    "description": "The LetStream is currently using a HashMap to hold its variable mappings. This is problematic because the ordering of the variables will be lost as they are evaluated. The test cases pass currently because single letter variables in ascending order are used which by luck caused the variables to be evaluated in order.\n\nThere is a very simple fix for this which is to use a LinkedHashMap to hold the variables to ensure they are evaluated in the order that they are received.",
