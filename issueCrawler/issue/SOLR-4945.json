As shown above.\n\nSolr returns only first instance offset and second instance is ignored.\n\nAlso it's observed, highlighter repeats first letter of the token if there is numeric.\nFor eg.Query : product and We have product1, highlighter returns as p<em>product</em>1.",

            "content": "Hi Christian,\n\nFor me this looks to be an issue with highlighting, suggestedTextHighlightOffset is returning incorrect values.\nWhen I run the same Query just with Autocomplete everything looks fine.\n\nWe are using - SenTokenizerFactory.\n\nIn the Analysis tab I can see words being tokenised correctly. For most of the cases Term Position and Source start end are defined right. For the above scenarios all the offset values seems to be right.\n\nJust one observation though (this is pretty confusing)- In few cases SenTokenizerFactory returns same offset values for repetitive words. For e.g.. if there are 2 instances of product in a sentence then both have the same source start and end as 0,4.  "

This is my speculation only \u2013 I really don't know...\n\nI believe JapaneseTokenizerFactory in normal mode gives a similar segmentation to SenTokenizer and it would be good to see if we can reproduce this using JapaneseTokenizerFactory.\n\nMany thanks.
