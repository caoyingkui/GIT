    "description": "We should remove the deprecated code from trunk. \n\nThis also has benefits to 4x branch, particularly:\n\n\twe should backport fixes to tests to avoid deprecated methods, e.g. IndexReader.open -> DirectoryReader.open. Of course I will add specific deprecated tests testing the back compat. This is all very important to\nensure easier merging from trunk->4x  for the future.\n\tby removing deprecated methods, I found some minor doc bugs, such as javadocs linking to deprecated stuff. I would like to backport these docs fixes as well.",
