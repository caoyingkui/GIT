            "content": "This simple patch adds 'sort' param to StandardRequestHandler and updates the tutorial docs to use the sort parameter rather then the ';' syntax\n\nTwo things to note:\n\n1. I had to delete some \"sort\", \"true\" parameters from the BasicFunctionalityTest.java TestSimpleFacetCounts.  \"sort=true\" does not evaluate to a valid sort string and these params were being ignored before\n\n2. This patch includes dummy defined constants in SolrParams.  The trunk branch seems to be missing some HIGHLIGHT params.  to get things to compile, i added the following - they should obviously not be commited:\n\n  public static final String HIGHLIGHT_FIELDS = null;\n  public static final String HIGHLIGHT = null;\n  public static final String MAX_SNIPPETS = null;\n  public static final String HIGHLIGHT_FORMATTER_CLASS = null;\n "

I am revisiting SOLR-20 and it is easier to have a standard \"sort\" parameter rather then one that depends if you are using dismax or standard. "

I'd like to commit it, but someone should take a look first.\n\nThis had to modify one line in BasicFunctionalityTest, there was a test that looks like it was trying to test the facet sorting.  it added the parameter \"sort\"=true to a test \u2013 this was just getting ignored (it should be facet.sort=true) and does not parse as a valid sort field.
