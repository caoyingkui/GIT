    "description": "The IDEA dev-tools configuration doesn't build in IDEA after running ant idea because the following modules are missing a dependency to analysis-common module:\n\n\n\tvelocity\n\textraction\n\tmap-reduce\n\tdataimporthandler-extras\n\n\n\nTo reproduce, run ant clean-idea followed by ant idea. Open the project in IDEA, configure the JDK, and make the project. The modules listed above will fail with an error finding org.apache.lucene.analysis.util.ResourceLoader. Adding analysis-common as a module dependency fixes this.",
