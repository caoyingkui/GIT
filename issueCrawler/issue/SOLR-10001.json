            "content": "From going through the logs, it seems that the test is likely to fail if testAddAndRemoveRole() gets run early on.  This test adds the 'overseer' role to a node, and then removes it, but it doesn't wait for the overseer status to change.  So if the next test tries to create a new collection, then we can get the overseer quitting in the middle of the creation command, leading to timeouts while the nodes all wait for each other to sort themselves out.\n\nIn general, if users are doing things like forceably changing Overseers, then they shouldn't be trying to run other cluster operations at the same time, so I think we're fine to fix this by making the test wait for the new Overseer to take over.
