    "description": "As SolrCloud is now used at fairly large scale, most users end up writing their own cluster management tools. We should have a framework for cluster management in Solr.\nIn a discussion with Noble Paul, we outlined the following steps w.r.t. the approach to having this implemented:\n\n\tBasic API calls for cluster management e.g. utilize added nodes, remove a node etc. These calls would need explicit invocation by the users to begin with. It would also specify the strategy to use. For instance I can have a strategy called optimizeCoreCount which would target to have an even no:of cores in each node . The strategy could optionally take parameters as well\n\tMetrics and stats tracking e.g. qps, etc. These would be required for any advanced cluster management tasks e.g. maintain a qps of 'x' by auto-adding a replica (using a recipe) etc. We would need collection/shard/node level views of metrics for this.\n\tRecipes: combination of multiple sequential/parallel API calls based on rules. This would be complicated specially as most of these would be long running series of tasks which would either have to be rolled back or resumed in case of a failure.\n\tEvent based triggers that would not require explicit cluster management calls for end users.",

            "content": "I think this is somewhat related to SOLR-9731. If we're going to be doing cluster management, we'll also need to be gathering some metrics about how each node is doing.\n\n9731 is about exposing metrics on a single Solr instance. The logical next step is to collect them system-wide and expose the system-wide metrics. Whether that'd be JMX or not is an open question, but it'd sure make operations people happy.\n\nSo while we're working on this particular issue (which I think is a great idea) perhaps we can do so with an eye towards exposing both the overall single-solr instance information and the aggregate information to external consumers.

Anyone with the link can comment on the google document without signing-in. \n\nIt outlines the basic concepts and the vocabulary we will use to discuss and implement this feature. It also has examples of various new APIs that will be written to support this feature.\n\nA good part of the design and terminology was conceived by the open source team at Lucidworks during our in-person meetings at San Francisco in February. Noble Paul and I are the primary authors of the document but it includes valuable ideas and feedback from all members of the open source team viz. Andrzej Bialecki , Cassandra Targett, Cao Manh Dat, Erick Erickson, Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Hoss, Steve Rowe and Trey Grainger. This contribution is being sponsored by Lucidworks Inc.\n\nThis is very much a living document and will continue to be refined as we think through various use-cases and edge cases. Please feel free to share your feedback and comments here.\n\nI have already created a features/autoscaling branch for this work on the public git repo and we've begun prototyping key pieces of the design for which we'll open sub-issues.

The policy and preference engine is mostly done so that is going to be the first thing that we will merge to master. The trigger support and rest of the autoscaling features are still being worked on and it is likely that they won't have enough testing before Solr 7. So our plan is to create a new branch off of master with just the bits from autoscaling branch that we feel are ready for merge/release in Solr 7. These include:\n\n\tThe policy and preference engine\n\tThe associated set-policy, set-cluster-policy and set-cluster-preferences API\n\tThe autoscaling read and diagnostics API\n\tMOVEREPLICA API (which is already present in master)\n\tSOLR-10419 \u2013 which changes all collection APIs to use the policy engine to place replicas\n\n\n\nI'll shortly be creating a feature/autoscaling_solr7 branch for these bits and we hope to merge it to master this week. I'll add a comment here once the branch is ready for review. ",
