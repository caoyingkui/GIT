    "description": "The build.xml doesn't specify a target VM version. Using JDK 1.5, this means the compiled .class files \nare automatically made for 1.5, with java.lang.StringBuilder insidiously used for string concatenation. \nGCJ doesn't seem to include this class yet, so when it gets to the gcj build it dies trying to read the class \nfiles.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Install Sun JDK 1.5 for a Java compiler\n2. Check out Lucene from svn\n3. 'ant gcj'\n\nExpected behavior:\nShould build Lucene to .class files and .jar with the JDK compiler and then compile an .a with GCJ.\n\nActual behavior:\nThe GCJ build fails, complaining of being unable to find java.lang.StringBuilder.\n\nSuggested fix:\nAdding source=\"1.3\" target=\"1.3\" to the <javac> tasks seems to take care of this. Patch to be attached.\n\nAdditional notes:\nUsing Lucene from SVN and GCJ pulled from GCC CVS circa 2005-04-19. Ant 1.6.2.",
