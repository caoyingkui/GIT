    "description": "This is incorrect and can lead to deployment issues:\n\n\nServlet Spec 2.5\n\nSRV.9.7.2 Web Application Class Loader\nThe class loader that a container uses to load a servlet in a WAR must\nallow the developer to load any resources contained in library JARs\nwithin the WAR following normal J2SE semantics using getResource. As\ndescribed in the J2EE license agreement, servlet containers that are\nnot part of a J2EE product should not allow the application to\noverride J2SE platform classes, such as those in the java.* and\njavax.* namespaces, that J2SE does not allow to be modified. Also,\nservlet containers that are part of a J2EE product should not allow\nthe application to override J2SE or J2EE platform classes, such as\nthose in java.* and javax.* namespaces, that either J2SE or J2EE do\nnot allow to be modified. The container should not allow applications\nto override or access the container\u2019s implementation\n\n\n\nThe fix is pretty easy and it would be nice to include it in the upcoming release of Solr 4.0",
