    "description": "The goal is a contrib module that builds Solr index using Hadoop MapReduce.\n\nIt is different from the Solr support in Nutch. The Solr support in Nutch sends a document to a Solr server in a reduce task. Here, the goal is to build/update Solr index within map/reduce tasks. Also, it achieves better parallelism when the number of map tasks is greater than the number of reduce tasks, which is usually the case.",

            "content": "The purpose of this simple initial version is to give people an idea of the functionality. It uses Hadoop contrib/index, which uses Hadoop mapred package. Future versions will be very different from this version. The main difference is that in this version, after a Solr input document is converted to a Lucene document, a Lucene index writer is used to build the index. In future versions, a Solr writer/core will be used.\n\nHere are some pre-requisites for this issue:\n\n\tHadoop 0.20. Hadoop 0.20 is to be released. There are two features in 0.20 that are important for this issue.\n    First is the new mapreduce package. The flexibility of the new mapreduce api makes it possible to use a Solr writer/core in mapper tasks.\n    Second is the upgrade to Jetty 6 (6.1.14). The current release 0.19 uses Jetty 5.\n\n\n\n\n\tThere are a couple of changes required in Solr.\n    First is to make SolrCore support an indexing-only mode (i.e. no search). Only then is it feasible to use it for indexing in a map task.\n    Second is to upgrate from Jetty 6.1.3 to Jetty 6.1.14. Hadoop 0.20 uses a feature that is not available in 6.1.3.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about making \"SolrCore support an indexing-only mode\"? "

I thought it is everything in the data directory, not just the Lucene index in the data/index directory, no? If that's the case:\n\n\tOn writing a Solr index in a ram directory, I'm aware of the directory factory, but it's only for the directory of Lucene index.\n\tOn merging multiple Solr indexes, besides merging the Lucene indexes, it also means somehow \"merging\" other data in the data directory (e.g. \"merging\" by rebuilding the spell check index).\n\n\n\nAm I correct?
