    "description": "Hi,\ncould you please add a getter for sortSpec into CollapsingQParserPlugin.CollapsingPostFilter class of the package org.apache.solr.search?\n\nIt could be useful in some case (for example when using a custom document booster...), and it would be consistent with some similar case, such as the grouping specification.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n\npublic SortSpec getSortSpec() {\n    return this.sortSpec;\n}\n\n\n\nThanks,\nbest regards.",
