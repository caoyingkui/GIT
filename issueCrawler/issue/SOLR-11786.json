This has become a problem for some users who build large suggester dictionaries.\n\nThe solr start scripts should offer a way to configure the java.io.tmpdir system property from an environment variable that may be set by the include script.\n\nInitial idea for the variable name: JAVA_TMP_DIR or maybe SOLR_JAVA_TMP_DIR",
