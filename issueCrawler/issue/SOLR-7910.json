    "description": "Spun off SOLR-7859.\n\nCurrently SimplePostTool is a part of solr-core, but has restrictions on the dependencies it can use (deps need to be added to bin/post, post.jar should be usable by itself etc.) which are not enforced in any way. SOLR-7901 is for adding some tests for this purpose, but really this should be checked at compile-time by the build system by needing dependencies to be whitelisted (if at all).",
