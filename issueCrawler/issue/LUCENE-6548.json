I still need to run full benchmarks to make sure that \"not so finite\" LevN automata (FuzzyQuery) didn't get slower.\n\nThe patch is bigger than it looks because I also factored out some methods from the way-too-big IntersectTermsEnum.next.\n\nThe gist of the speedup is to avoid calling RunAutomaton.step on the lead byte of a term's suffix since we already know whether this byte matches the current transition.
