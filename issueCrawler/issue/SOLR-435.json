It's better than an error, IMO.\n\nFYI aside from seeing this from time to time in my own Solr work, the Ajax-Solr framework has a work-around to basically automatically supply q or q.alt with '*:*' in different circumstances, and it's quite a hack.  You can argue the user should explicitly supply *:* but then if they forget, they get a Solr error. "

It used to be an error. This basically means 'q' isn't required and q.alt=: is redundant. (dsmiley)\n\n\n\nI also discovered and fixed a bug in edismax in which a query of pure whitespace threw an error. dismax didn't do this. It was a trivial fix in which a trim() was forgotten.\n\nThere are many ways to approach addressing this issue with different pros/cons; it was hard to ultimately settle on what I chose to do.  I could have modified QueryComponent, or just QParser, or just the actual QParser subclasses.

I think it's much better to throw a clear error \"q param is not specified\" but i certainly see the value in adding q.alt support to the LuceneQParser with the same semantics as dismax (used if q is missing or all whitespace) .. not sure why we've never considered that before.

QParsers are not required to respect what the QueryComponent gives them, so you can specify whatever you like in 'q' or 'fq' and QParser can totally ignore it.\n\nIt just feels a little messy and confusing because wherever the query string identification occurs is where the validation should occur too, right?

Those have defaults that (if they don't match what you tried to specify) are immediately obvious ... the 'start' attribute on the docList returned is wrong, you get more results then you expected, you get field names you know you didn't specify, etc...  it's less obvious when you are looking at the results of a query that it's a match-all query instead of the query you thought you were specifying.\n\nlike i said ... i'm -0 to having a hardcoded default query for lucene/dismax/edismax ... if you feel strongly about it that's fine, allthough i would try to convince you \"match none\" is a better hardcoded default then 'match all' (so that it's easier to recognize mistakes quickly) and really don't think we should do it w/o also add q.alt support to the LuceneQParser so people can override it.\n "

I just have problems with the fact they kind of do this today.  Both DisMaxQParser and ExtendedDisMaxParser check the q.alt parameter when the string given to them is null.  So imagine if they're being used to parse a filter query but for whatever reason they are given a null string so they use the q.alt value instead, even though thats totally unrelated.\n\n\nby putting this kind of validation/error checking in the QParser.parse method, we ensure that it is used properly even when the QParser(s) are used for things like 'fq' params or in nested subqueries\n\nAgain I agree.

David's suggestion for \"missing query string\" aligns with other such messages (so I'm all for adding it).

But that is only usable when a q.alt is specified in the local params of the QParser.  We don't prevent users from specifying it as a normal param, and then the QParser can be looking up a parameter that is not intended to be for it.  For safety, shouldn't we constrain such parameters to being local params only?\n\n\nIt wouldn't have to ... parse() can throw ParseExceptions and QueryCOmponent (or whatever delegated to the QParser can wrap that in a user error (QueryCOmponent already does that)\n\nIt doesn't really do that though.  Take DisMaxQParser for example, if it can't find a query string through either its given string or through the q.alt param, it throws a SolrException which isn't caught by QueryComponent.  So there isn't any context here except through the stack trace.  At best the QueryComponent catches a ParseException but since it wraps both the parsing of the main query and filter queries into the same try-catch block, it just wraps the ParseException in a SolrException and throws it.  Again, no context. "

Take DisMaxQParser for example, if it can't find a query string through either its given string or through the q.alt param, it throws a SolrException \n\nSorry ... i was looking at my patched version \u2013 agreed it should throw ParseException\n\nAt best the QueryComponent catches a ParseException but since it wraps both the parsing of the main query and filter queries into the same try-catch block, it just wraps the ParseException in a SolrException and throws it. Again, no context.\n\n...that can be fixed though, it doesn't cahnge the question of semantics for the QParsers themselves\n\n\u2014\n\nHere's the patch i put together, the attempted goal was:\n\n1) add javadocs to QParser.parse documenting the (current) expectations\n2) automated test verifying that al built-in QParsers meet the expectations when given null or empty string\n3) standardizes lucene, dismax, and edismax to treat empty query strings as valid representations of matching nothing\n4) fixes all the other special case QParsers to throw a ParseError on null or empty string based on what makes sense (ie: things like TermQParser should allow \"\" as input, but things like FunctionQParser should not)\n\n...however the test is currently broken, because it doesn't account for the fact that some of the special case QParsers have other required params \u2013 it does however nicely demonstrate other ways these Qparsers do a bad job of reporting errors.\n\nGiven te level of debate in this issue, and the differences in opinion on what the right / wrong way to address this broader topic of query parsing validation i suggest we punt on this for Solr 3.6 \u2013 I'd rather leave things the way they are then make a bad decision in a hurry "

SOLR-2001 is only on trunk, somehow i overlooked that and it contributed to my confusion as to some of the comments in this issue.\n\nSo instead of NPEs or what not that you get in 3.5 from various parsers, we switch to consistent'new ParseException(\"missing query string\");' in 3.6, and address if there can be better default handling in 4.0 (continuing what SOLR-2001 started)\n\n+1 "
