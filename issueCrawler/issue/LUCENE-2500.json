    "description": "I've been testing how we could prevent Lucene's merges from evicting\npages from the OS's buffer cache.  I tried fadvise/madvise (via JNI)\nbut (frustratingly), I could not get them to work (details at\nhttp://chbits.blogspot.com/2010/06/lucene-and-fadvisemadvise.html).\n\nThe only thing that worked was to use Linux's O_DIRECT flag, which\nforces all IO to bypass the buffer cache entirely... so I created a\nLinux-specific Directory impl to do this.",
