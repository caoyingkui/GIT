I found that Parallel SQL queries using aggregate functions do not seem to work with collections which have capital letters in the name. \n\nWhen searching around for information on this I found this thread where someone else encountered the same issue and was told to open a bug on it, but it doesn't look like they ever did.\n\nThe thread has an example query and stack trace.",
