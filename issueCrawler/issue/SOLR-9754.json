            "content": "The service install script creates the solr user with the system standard shell, not /bin/false.  I think it also creates that user such that it would be unable to log in (on Linux, the user gets an asterisk in the password field, not an empty value or a valid hash), regardless of the shell assigned.\n\nThe shebang in bin/solr is \"/usr/bin/env bash\" ... not \"/bin/sh\" ... so if we were to implement your idea, I think we should use the same value that the bin/solr script does.  Although it's highly unlikely that /bin/sh will be absent, using that value does represent another potential dependency that running directly with bin/solr does not impose. ",
