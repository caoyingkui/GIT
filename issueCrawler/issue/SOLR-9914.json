    "description": "This patch refactors the \"contains\" logic for only including constraints which contain a given substring, into a \"Predicate<BytesRef>\" interface and \"SubstringBytesRefFilter\" implementation. \nThis allows users to have custom logic for including terms in the filter counts, not only based on substring matches.",
