(http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/join/org/apache/lucene/search/join/ToParentBlockJoinQuery.html 'The child documents must be orthogonal to the parent documents: the wrapped child query must never return a parent document.').

I agree that it's rather Lucene issue and should be covered by appropriate tests.\n\nI see your point about adding cost for correct usage. If I enable assertions without adding the validateParents, testAdvanceValidationForToChildBjq always fail, which means that there could be another way for query validation. Let me investigate it.\n\nThank you,\n\nDr Oleg Savrasov,\nCommunity Coordinator,\nGrid Dynamics Search team "

In order to prove that, I've created a test which expects appropriate AssertionError, please see attached SOLR-5553-insufficient_assertions.patch. The test fails for example with -Dtests.seed=E8A0C61499EE8851:C5E7CB6721742C4F.\n\nI have not found any way for correct validation other than checking parentBits. It costs retrieving appropriate bit from FixedBitSet, but it seems not too expensive.\n\nThe test is reworked in order to be Lucene-level and cover the cases when existing assertions are not sufficient. Please see attached SOLR-5553-1.patch. "
