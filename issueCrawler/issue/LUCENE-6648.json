            "content": "Here is a patch. It removes oal.search.Filter usage from lucene/facet and as a side-effect from lucene/demo as well since Filter was only used for facets there.\n\nThis patch is a simple 1:1 migration but we might be able to do better in the future. For instance there are some parts of the code that look like a query being explicitely split into a fast approximation and a slow confirmation (Range.getQuery(fastMatchQuery, ValueSource)) that we might be able to handle more nicely now API-wise?
