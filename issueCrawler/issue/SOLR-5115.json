This patch supports file:// resources that are delegated back to SolrResourceLoader.\n\nSee also http://www.mail-archive.com/solr-user@lucene.apache.org/msg86856.html why i could no longer make Solr work with large configuration files.",

You said raising the limit used to work for you - perhaps we should get to the bottom of why it does not anymore?\n\nWe other options to look at as well - compression, the api that lets you write multiple zk nodes atomically (split large files), etc. "
