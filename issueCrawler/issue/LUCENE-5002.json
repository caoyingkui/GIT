Yet, it's not hanging but concurrent access to IW while IW#deleteAll() is called is entirely broken IMO. I don't even know where to start, here is a small wrapup of the failures I saw:\n\n\tasserts are tripped in global field map since we clear and concurrently index (remember indexing is non-blocking)\n\tconcurrent commits fail with fiel not found exception (even if we fully sync) seems like some state in IW is not cleared\n\tupdatePendingMerges fails with FNF when merges are updated concurrently.\n\n\n\nTo begin with I doubt that the semantics of IW#deleteAll() are correct today if you are accessing the IW concurrently. I mean we basically dropping everything and don't maintain any happens before relationship here at all, delete all files that are not referenced in any seg info wipe all the global field infos etc. We should address this properly.\n\nI agree that we have to fix this until 4.3.1!\n\nYet, Serguiuz  do you see any FileNotFoundExceptions or anything when you concurrently call deleteAll? I mean this seems entirely broken to me at this point. I suggest you to use deleteQuery(new MatchAllDocsQuery()) for now and not lock globally. \n\nsimon ",

This is just like you can call IW.close from one thread while other threads are still indexing but those other threads can hit strange exceptions.\n\nI'll open a new issue to somehow simplify IW's sync... it's a mess now.
