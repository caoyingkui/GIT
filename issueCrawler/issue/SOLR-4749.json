            "content": "The publishCoresAsDown() code holds the same lock as used for everything else now, and publishes to ZK with the lock held, effectively preventing any other core operations for the duration.  It's tough to determine if this has real practical downsides as it's only called during shutdown, but perhaps we should move the publish outside the synchronization just in case (unless it's really needed of course).
