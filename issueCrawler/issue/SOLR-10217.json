If it accepted an incoming stream then the source data could be the result of any other stream whereas with a query the source data can only be the result of a Solr query. ",

The algorithm is written with an AnalyticsQuery and works directly with the index, so collecting a bitset for the background query scales really well. Using a stream we would have to feed docID's back into the AnalyticsQuery to get the background set, just seemed a lot less scalable.\n ",

Jan H\u00f8ydahl, if there is a particularly strategic use case for the background query that you're looking at, feel free to explain it in the ticket and I can perhaps pick the ticket back up sooner.
