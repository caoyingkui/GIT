    "description": "The case is like this:\nI have 'content' field with content extracted with tika and several fields for language versions (like content_pl, content_en, content_es, content_ru, etc). \nI also use custom langid component which can copy 'content' to serveral content_* fields if it detects more than one language (so those parts are properly stemmed in every language present in text).\n\nNow to use highlighter in such scenario I need to store all those language fields even if their contents is always same as the one in 'content' field.\n\nWould be nice if I could configure language specific fields to be not stored, and configure highlighter to take tokens positions from those fields and apply them to text in 'content' field...\nIn other words - to say: take tokens from 'content_pl', and prepare highlight based on text in 'content' field.\nIt could be administrator responsibility to guarantee that mapped fields have same content.",
