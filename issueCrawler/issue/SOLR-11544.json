If I try something similar (using a different version of solr), I get the expected response:\n\n/select?wt=json&indent=true&q=tag:porq&spellcheck=true&spellcheck.dictionary=spellchecker&spellcheck.count=20&spellcheck.collate=true\n\n\n{\n    \"responseHeader\": {\n        \"status\": 0,\n        \"QTime\": 8,\n        \"params\": {\n            \"q\": \"tag:porq\",\n            \"spellcheck.dictionary\": \"spellchecker\",\n            \"indent\": \"true\",\n            \"spellcheck\": \"true\",\n            \"spellcheck.count\": \"20\",\n            \"wt\": \"json\",\n            \"spellcheck.collate\": \"true\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"response\": {\n        \"numFound\": 0,\n        \"start\": 0,\n        \"docs\": [ ]\n    },\n    \"spellcheck\": {\n        \"suggestions\": [\n            \"porq\",\n            {\n                \"numFound\": 20,\n                \"startOffset\": 4,\n                \"endOffset\": 8,\n                \"suggestion\": [\n                    \"port\",\n                    \"pork\",\n                   ...etc...\n                ]\n            },\n            \"collation\",\n            \"tag:port\"\n        ]\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\nCould you write a failing unit test for this?  See https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/solr/core/src/test/org/apache/solr/spelling/SpellCheckCollatorTest.java for some of the existing test cases around this functionality.  Without a failing unit test, I am not sure there is anything to do.\n\nA workaround you can use is to use \"spellcheck.q=polt\" and then reconstruct the query in your application. ",

Previously it was not working for me because there was a non-alphanumeric character removal filter on spellcheck field on query side which was removing ':' character from the spellcheck query. ",
