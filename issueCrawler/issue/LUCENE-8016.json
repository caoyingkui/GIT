    "description": "We allow any boosts to be passed down to similarities, eg. via BoostQuery. This is a bit trappy since it means that you can make scores rounded down to 0 and/or slow to compute (because of subnormal floats) by using tiny boosts, or infinite scores if you pass boosts that are too close to the float max value.\n\nI would like to restrict boosts to be either +0 or between 2 -10 and 2 10 .\n\nAny objections?",
