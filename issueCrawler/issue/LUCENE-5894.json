    "description": "Today its only usable really by stored fields/term vectors, has hardcoded logic in SegmentMerger specific to certain impls, etc.\n\nIt would be better if this was generalized to terms/postings/norms/docvalues as well.\n\nBulk merge is boring, the real idea is to allow codecs to do more: e.g. with this patch they could do streaming checksum validation, or prevent the loading of \"latent\" norms, or other things we cannot do today.",

            "content": "+1, I think this patch is nice; it's great to have merging fully under\ncontrol of the codec.  There are lots of nice improvements here:\n\n\n\tSegmentMerger is much simpler\n\n\n\n\n\tMerging responsibility moves to XXXConsumer, and bulk-merge optos\n    (and new MatchingReaders class) are now entirely codec private\n    (CompressingStoredFields/TVFormat)\n\n\n\n\n\tMoved old writers (Lucene40StoredFields/TVsWriter) to\n    test-framework so compressing (current default) is the only writer\n    now.\n\n\n\n\n\tWe now need a NormsConsumer/Producer (can't reuse DVConsumer) since the\n    source for norms must be \"known\" in the default merge impl.\n\n\n\n\n\tFactored out SegmentDocValuesProducer to hold all per-field DVPs,\n    updates.\n\n\n\n\n\tAlso separated out the classes in IW that buffer up norms in RAM\n    until flush from the DV classes, letting you remove\n    trackDocsWithField boolean...\n\n\n\nI think this is a good cleanup!
