    "description": "The distributed code inside search components such as QueryComponent and FacetComponent is complex. By structuring responsibilities\nthe code becomes less complex and easier to understand. There is already a start for this that was part of distributed grouping (SOLR-2066).\nThe following concepts were developed inside QueryComponent for SOLR-2066:\n\n\tShardRequestFactory is responsible for creating requests to shards in the cluster based on the incoming request from the client.\n\tShardResultTransformer. Transforming a NamedList response from the client in for example SearchGroup or TopDocs instance.\n\tShardResponseProcessor. Basically merges the shard responses. The ShardReponseProcessor uses a ShardResultTransformer to transform the shard response into a native structure (SearchGroup / TopGroups).\n\n\n\nThese concepts are now only used for distributed grouping, but I think can also be used for non grouped distributed search.",
