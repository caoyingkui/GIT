    "description": "As per several postings I noted that I can define variables inside an invariants list section of the DIH handler of solrconfig.xml. I can also reference these variables within data-config.xml. This works properly, the solr field \"test\" is nicely populated. However it is not substituted into my regex transformer? Here is my  data-config.xml which gives a hint of the use case.\n\n   <dataConfig>\n   <dataSource name=\"myfilereader\" type=\"FileDataSource\"/>    \n    <document>\n       <entity name=\"jc\"\n\t       processor=\"FileListEntityProcessor\"\n\t       fileName=\"^.*\\.xml$\"\n\t       newerThan=\"'NOW-1000DAYS'\"\n\t       recursive=\"true\"\n\t       rootEntity=\"false\"\n\t       dataSource=\"null\"\n\t       baseDir=\"/Volumes/spare/ts/fords/dtd/fordsxml/data\">\n\t  <entity name=\"x\"\n\t          dataSource=\"myfilereader\"\n\t\t  processor=\"XPathEntityProcessor\"\n\t\t  url=\"${jc.fileAbsolutePath}\"\n\t\t  stream=\"false\"\n\t\t  forEach=\"/record\"\n\t\t  transformer=\"DateFormatTransformer,TemplateTransformer,RegexTransformer,HTMLStripTransformer\">\n\n   <field column=\"fileAbsolutePath\" template=\"${jc.fileAbsolutePath}\" />\n   <field column=\"fileWebPath\"      regex=\"${dataimporter.request.finstalldir}(.*)\" replaceWith=\"$1\" sourceColName=\"fileAbsolutePath\"/>\n   <field column=\"test\"             template=\"${dataimporter.request.finstalldir}\" />\n   <field column=\"title\"            xpath=\"/record/title\" />\n   <field column=\"para\"             xpath=\"/record/sect1/para\" stripHTML=\"true\" />\n   <field column=\"date\"             xpath=\"/record/metadata/date[@qualifier='Date']\" dateTimeFormat=\"yyyyMMdd\"   />\n   \t     </entity>\n       </entity>\n       </document>\n    </dataConfig>\n\nShalin has pointed out that we are creating the regex Pattern without first resolving the variable. So we need to call VariableResolver.resolve on the 'regex' attribute's value before creating the Pattern object.",

            "content": "Is it possible that an equivalent change needs made to other transformers?\n\nYes, I think so. We need to review other transformer and entity processors to make sure we attempt to resolve all attributes.\n\nIs the construct ${XXX} a valid part of a regular expression, I dont think so, but.... ?\n\nCurly braces are used in regex to specify repetitions but they are not preceded by '$'. I think VariableResolver ignores any variables it is not able to resolve, so we should be fine; we will need to check this though. "

Moreover it is not backcompat. We can add extra method\n\n\tContextImpl.getResolvedEntityAttribute\n\tContextImpl.getAllResolvedEntityFields .It is expensive to do that in here because the component may be interested in only one variable and we end up resolving all variables . If we can cache it it may be ok.\n\n "
