    "description": "Historically, you had to invert fields (indexed=true) to do any queries against them.\n\nBut now its possible to build a forward index for the field (docValues=true).\nI think in many cases (e.g. a string field you only sort and match on), its unnecessary and wasteful\nto force the user to also invert if they don't need scoring.\n\nSo I think solr should support match-only semantics in this case for term,wildcard,range,etc.",
