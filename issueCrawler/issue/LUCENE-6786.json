    "description": "Today IW has try/finally around places (flush, merge) that write\nper-segment files and on exception uses IFD.refresh(String) to remove\nany newly created but now unreferenced files.\n\nBut, since merge exceptions are now tragic, and IFD.refresh() (not\ntaking a segment name) will be called, doing the same thing, I think\nit's safe to remove the per-segment refresh.\n\nThis makes IW a little bit simpler ... and it means at least one fewer Directory.listAll while handling merge exceptions.",
