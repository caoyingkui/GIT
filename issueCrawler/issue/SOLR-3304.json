            "content": "Attached is the first draft.\n\nThe Solr support for the new Lucene spatial module is a set of field types which are effectively adapters into the real logic in Lucene.  Even all the configuration option initialization from the fieldType attributes are done in Lucene.  A map of these is passed with a utility wrapper to detect which attributes were seen so that they can be removed afterwards. And so if you typo a parameter then you'll get an error like you would for any other field type.\n\nThe Lucene spatial module supports sorting indirectly by having a spatial Query's score be the distance.  Of course you don't always need the score/distance and so there is a local-param attribute needScore which can be set to false, such as in a filter query (see SOLR-2883).\n\nI'll say the tests here are so-so; I welcome input on how they can be structured to be more effective.  Since the real logic is all in the Lucene spatial module, ideally the tests on the Solr side would be fairly minimal in this regard... just instantiate the various field types exercising a few features and a few options.\n\nSome TODOs:\n\n\tDocument how to use it in the wiki\n\tAt least some basic tests for the SpatialTwoDoublesFieldType and SpatialTermQueryPrefixTreeFieldtype.\n\n\n\nAt least for now, I don't envision the capabilities here replacing the Solr spatial introduced in 3x; it is a new alternative.

I welcome input on what to name the page  since it works significantly different than the existing Solr spatial (what I call Solr 3 spatial).  I moved a particular extensive geohash based search test that is in this patch to LUCENE-4157 last night.  I think what remains as far as this code is concerned is mostly about testing various field types with their configuration, but not worrying about in-depth testing of the algorithms which instead belongs in Lucene spatial module's tests.

This should be addressed in Lucene Spatial or Spatial4j but probably not here, I feel.  Comments?\n\tTest 2d (non-geo) spatial.  Ugh.  I'd probably do another test file with similar tests, perhaps fewer.\n\tFix \"distErrPct\" taking a fraction and not a percent. This problem is in Lucene spatial.\n\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n\tThe TwoDoubles type is not tested here. If I were to add it, it would surely break as it can't handle circles and probably has other problems.  Thoughts, Ryan? I know you wrote that one.\n\tConsider moving the factory stuff out of Lucene spatial into the Solr adapters?  I put them in Lucene spatial because I was thinking of the bigger picture of clients other than Solr that might use the same name-value initialization parameters.  Chris doesn't seem to be a fan because the least-common-denominator way I represented this is a Map<String,String> which is admittedly dirtly.\n\n "

            "content": "Thanks for finding and fixing that bug Andy. Your fix wasn't quite right though since the getStrategy() method you refactored synchronized on a parameter (pointless) instead of the field. I fixed this.\n\nThis new patch makes that and various other changes:\n\n\tsynchronized with the latest source tree (e.g. Spatial4j 0.3)\n\t\n\t\tThis means distances are now degrees based (0-180 for circle radius) not kilometers\n\t\n\t\n\tremoved ignoreIncompatibleGeometry option (see LUCENE-4173)\n\tUse the input string as the stored value that is returned.  So if you give \"lat,lon\" then that's what you get back, in whatever number of decimal places you chose.\n\tadded prefixGridScanLevel performance tuning option to SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType (simply exposed it from the strategy)\n\tkeep distErrPct as a fraction (no change)\n\n\n\nIt would be nice to have a kilometer unit option but that isn't easily done until Spatial4j's shape reader gets to be more flexible.  That can wait.\n\nThat \"needScore\" local-param hack (see SOLR-2883) is unfortunate, as Solr can't get a Filter from a field type.  I'm tempted to change the default to 'false' as leaving it at true' triggers large RAM requirements and slow-downs for SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType.  This could be an opportunity to specify what the score should be, come to think of it.  Instead of needScore=\"false\", maybe score=\"none\" (default) or score=\"distance\" or score=\"recipDistance\" or something like that.\n\nThe TwoDoubles strategy needs more attention and tests in Lucene spatial, but I don't want that to hold up this patch.  Shall I remove the adapter or let it get committed but don't advertise it until it's more worthy? "
