    "description": "Just something I noticed. Langid imports langdetect from Maven; this includes language profiles already so a redundant copy is kept in Solr source code (and in target binaries). All the files except two are identical. The two different profiles are for 'ro' and 'vi' (Romanian and Vietnamese I presume). I checked the git repo and both have been adjusted by the author to support some notion of normalization. I think Solr should use the embedded profiles since they most likely come together with changes in the source code.",
