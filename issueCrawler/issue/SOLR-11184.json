    "description": "---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Hrishikesh Gadre <gadre.solr@gmail.com>\nDate: Sat, Jul 22, 2017 at 3:59 AM\nSubject: Apache Solr - security vulnerability (delegation token functionality)\nTo: security@apache.org\n\n\nHi,\n\nWe found a security vulnerability in the delegation token\nfunctionality in Solr. This feature was added in Solr in 6.2 release\n(SOLR-9200).\n\nThe delegation token functionality provided by Hadoop authentication\nuses Apache curator framework to store the security related metadata.\nSolr uses /security directory to store this information.\n\nThere are two issues with this functionality (when using\nSecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g.\nSaslZkACLProvider),\n\nThe ACLs for /security znode are configured as (\u2018world\u2019,\u2019anyone\u2019) even\nthough the implementation of SecurityAwareZkACLProvider intends to\nrestrict access only for the solr super user.\n\nThe znodes under /security directory (e.g. /security/token) are\nconfigured just like any other configuration file (i.e. modifiable by\nsolr admin and readable by world). SecurityAwareZkACLProvider on the\nother hand intends to restrict access only for the solr super user.\n\nThe possible consequences of this vulnerability are severe. e.g.\n(a) a malicious user can read the security tokens in Zookeeper and\ngain access to the Solr cluster.\n(b) a malicious user can delete the security related metadata in\nZookeeper and disrupt operations performed by authenticated users.\nThis is possible since the (\u2018world\u2019,\u2019anyone\u2019) permission on /security\ndirectory allows attacker to delete the child znodes under that path.\n\nPlease find the attached patch which includes a unit test and the fix.\nLet me know if any additional information required from my side.\n\nThanks\nHrishikesh",
