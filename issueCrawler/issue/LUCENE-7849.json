The release manager for a creates the branch (like branch_6_5 pattern) at the time of a feature freeze.\n\nWoops! I realized I asked you to assign to 6.6 which is the release in-progress.  This is a bug fix so you could in fact port to branch_6_6  but since you opted not to, you can set the fix version to 6.7\n\n(BTW I re-assigned the only other issue from branch_6x version and I then deleted that JIRA version).
