            "content": "I have precommit succeeding for all the source code, I removed the bits in check-source-patterns.groovy\u00a0 (thanks Christine for pointing me there) that restricted the tests to solr/contrib and solr/core, as well as the patterns that allowed Logger and LOG as names.\n\nAlong the way I realized that my \"special cases\", weren't really a problem. The validation is a little loose, but take SolrCore, which has three loggers declared:\n\n\tlog\n\trequestLog\n\tslowLog\n\n\n\nthat all works fine because the test is actually \"if slf4j is mentioned AND there's a valid Java identifier for logging declared AND there's at least one logger defined that adheres strictly to the pattern, pass the file\".\n\nSo the presence of the \"log\" declaration makes the check succeed and the requestLog and slowLog are ignored. This would also succeed if those other loggers didn't use the MethodHandles.lookup bits I think, but don't really think it's a big enough deal to worry about.\n\nSimilarly for ZkStateReader, the top-level\u00a0\n\nprivate static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());\n\ndeclaration makes the file\u00a0pass and the non-static declaration in the inner class is OK:\n\nprivate final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());\n\nAnd so on. I did see one thing that I think is incorrect and is not caught by the validation in\u00a0CheckLoggingConfiguration.java:\n\nLoggerFactory.getLogger(CheckLoggingConfiguration.class);\n\nI changed it to\u00a0\n\nLoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());\n\nand will check\u00a0everything in if tests pass, probably this evening.
