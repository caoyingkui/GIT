    "description": "When you hit an unhandled exception in ConcurrentMergeScheduler, it\nthrows a MergePolicy.MergeException, but there's no easy way to figure\nout which index caused this (if you have more than one).\n\nI plan to add the Directory to the MergeException.  I also made a few\nother small changes to ConcurrentMergeScheduler:\n\n\n\tAdded handleMergeException method, which is called on exception,\n    so that you can subclass ConcurrentMergeScheduler to do something\n    when an exception occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded getMergeThread() method so you can override how the threads\n    are created (eg, if you want to make them in a different thread\n    group, use a pool, change priorities, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded doMerge(...) to actually do this merge, so you can do\n    something before starting and after finishing a merge.\n\n\n\n\n\tChanged private -> protected on a few attrs\n\n\n\nI plan to commit in a day or two.",
