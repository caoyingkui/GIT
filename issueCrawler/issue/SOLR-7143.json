    "description": "The newly introduced MoreLikeThis Query Parser (SOLR-6248) does not return any results when supplied with multiple fields in the qf parameter.\n\nTo reproduce within the techproducts example, compare:\n\n\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=%7B!mlt+qf=name%7DMA147LL/A'\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=%7B!mlt+qf=features%7DMA147LL/A'\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=%7B!mlt+qf=name,features%7DMA147LL/A'\n\n\n\nThe first two queries return 8 and 5 results, respectively. The third query doesn't return any results (not even the matched document).\n\nIn contrast, the MoreLikeThis Handler works as expected (accounting for the default mintf and mindf values in SimpleMLTQParser):\n\n\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/mlt?q=id:MA147LL/A&mlt.fl=name&mlt.mintf=1&mlt.mindf=1'\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/mlt?q=id:MA147LL/A&mlt.fl=features&mlt.mintf=1&mlt.mindf=1'\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/mlt?q=id:MA147LL/A&mlt.fl=name,features&mlt.mintf=1&mlt.mindf=1'\n\n\n\nAfter adding the following line to example/techproducts/solr/techproducts/conf/solrconfig.xml:\n\n\n<requestHandler name=\"/mlt\" class=\"solr.MoreLikeThisHandler\" />\n\n\n\nThe first two queries return 7 and 4 results, respectively (excluding the matched document). The third query returns 7 results, as one would expect.",

Returning a non-null value always ensures that the code flow never hits:\n\nString[] qf = parseLocalParamsSplitted(\"qf\"); // Never returns null\n\nif (qf != null) { }\nelse { // Never gets here }\n\n ",

I'm new here and don't really know what's expected of me. I have verified that the latest patch works for this particular issue and I, too, would like to see the query parser functionality brought on par with the handler functionality (parameters and defaults, including an mlt.match.include\"exclude current document from results\" equivalent).\n\nHowever, there's still a problem with the current approach (multiple qf parameters: yes, comma-separated list: no): Only the latter would work properly with parameter dereferencing:\n\n\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=%7B!mlt+qf=$mlt.fl%7DMA147LL/A&mlt.fl=name,features'\n\n\n\nSets qf=name,features, which is not split into name and features with the latest patch.\n\n\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=%7B!mlt+qf=$mlt.fl%7DMA147LL/A&mlt.fl=name&mlt.fl=features'\n\n\n\nSets qf=name, ignores subsequent mlt.fl parameters.\n\nPlease let me know if I can do anything.

We may already have parts of it from the existing patch. ",
