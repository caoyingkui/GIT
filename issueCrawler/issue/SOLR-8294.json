    "description": "This confused me. There are numerous solrconfig.xml under example-DIH, all of these configs specify a number of things other than DIH configuration (for example all  of them specify the clustering plugin).\n\nIs this intentional? I would clean up the clustering plugin's config from there as it doesn't seem to be relevant to DIH and results in duplication (and possibly confusion).",
