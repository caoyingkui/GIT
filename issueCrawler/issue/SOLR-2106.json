SOLR-2010 only provides a workaround for what you want but it might be good enough...\n\n\n\tCreate a dictionary containing all the fields your dismax config searches.  Use <copyField> in your configuration to build the dictionary.\n\tThe spellchecker will collate based on all the words in the dictionary.  This might be ok, but you may get a lot of nonsense collations that return no results.\n\tApply SOLR-2010 if you want it to give only collations that are guaranteed to return results.\n\tYour client will have to re-query SOLR based on the collation(s) returned.  There is no functionality (yet) that automatically redirects you to the top collation or something like that.\n\n "
