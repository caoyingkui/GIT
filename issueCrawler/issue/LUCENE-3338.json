[1 TO } will always return nothing. It seems the exclusive operator there will take precedence over the inclusive operator. I double checked, and the NumericRangeQuery is correct, so I suppose this is the expected behavour of NumericRangeQuery. ",

Maybe its a problem of the test setup?\n\nI will for now commit the javadoc improvements and post a delta patch. ",

I am thinking about a way to disable those for generated classes (using the regexes to add SuppressWarnings(\n{\"unchecked\",\"rawtypes\"}\n) in the build.xml). ",
