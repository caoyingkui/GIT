    "description": "We have four cores A,B,C,D and no value for defaultCoreName in solr.xml. In the UI we see the four cores properly listed. When we assign a value A to defaultCoreName, core A is no longer named as A in both UI and Solr built URL's. Instead, it's now called singlecore.\nNormal request handlers still work with the real core name so only URL's in the UI are affected.",
