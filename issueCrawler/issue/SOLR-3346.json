    "description": "Instead of 'qt' being handled by the SolrDispatchFilter (a Servlet Filter), it would be better implemented as a request handler, with a suggested name of DispatchingRequestHandler.  This is better because:\n\n\tit keeps the servlet filter more focused / simplified (albeit just a little)\n\tit simplifies solrconfig.xml by removing/deprecating handleSelect=\"true\".  'qt' is less magic, it works more explicitly.\n\tif you don't want to use 'qt' dispatch, simply don't use DispatchingRequestHandler\n\tDispatchingRequestHandler would get used by EmbeddedSolrServer but SolrDispatchFilter is not.\n\n\n\nCredit: Hoss's idea, Erik coded a first draft",

            "content": "I'm too overwhelmed with other stuff to battle this, but I entirely disagree.  SolrDispatchFilter needs to have it's logic moved down a layer when it comes to determining which request handler to hit, in my opinion.  Having this kind of logic at the web tier, for one thing, requires that folks using Solr embedded (or in direct connection kinda tests) have to recreate this logic.  That's just one reason we should eliminate the handleSelect/qt business.  As we've seen, though, it's a thorny topic that necessitates changes in 3rd party clients, etc to eliminate qt, and this is what this issue is about - keeping a backwards-compatible layer for qt support while making it trivial to enable or not.  Hoss mentioned \"multitudes of existing users who are happy using 'qt' without security concerns\" - my assertion is that these users don't know the types of capabilities that are open (perhaps thinking if they just removed/blocked /admin that they'd be safer).
