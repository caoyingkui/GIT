But if that, the result will be the new register node can't be elect the leader, we also know the old sessionid ephemeral node is invalid, but don't know why it is exist.\n\nAnd the other issue :\njoinElection method:\ntry \n{\n        leaderSeqPath = zkClient.create(shardsElectZkPath + \"/\" + id + \"-n_\", null,\n            CreateMode.EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL, false);\n        context.leaderSeqPath = leaderSeqPath;\n        cont = false;\n      }\n catch (ConnectionLossException e) {\n        // we don't know if we made our node or not...\n        List<String> entries = zkClient.getChildren(shardsElectZkPath, null, true);\n\n        boolean foundId = false;\n        for (String entry : entries) {\n          String nodeId = getNodeId(entry);\n          if (id.equals(nodeId)) \n{\n            // we did create our node...\n            foundId  = true;\n            break;\n          }\n        }\n        if (!foundId) {\n          cont = true;\n          if (tries++ > 20) \n{\n            throw new ZooKeeperException(SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR,\n                \"\", e);\n          }\n          try \n{\n            Thread.sleep(50);\n          }\n catch (InterruptedException e2) \n{\n            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n          }\n        }\n\n      } \n\nIf meet the ConnectionLossException status, maybe will double create the ephemeral sequential node.\n\nFor my suggestion, can't trace why create the two ephemeral nodes for the same server, but can protect it.",
