    "description": "I've been sitting on this patch for over 2 years (and likewise it's been running IN production for the same) ... finally got around to contributing it back to the community.\u00a0 This change prepares the UIMAUpdateRequestProcessor to allow subclasses to have additional control over how the analysis engine is selected.\u00a0 In my case, I wrote a sub-class that allows for dynamic detection of the UIMA analysis engine based on the document fields.\u00a0 ie: a field in the document can be used to select different UIMA configurations and rules.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCan someone please commit this as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0I don't necessarily need it to be back-ported, having in 7.4.1 would suffice.\n\nThanks!",

I added comments in SOLR-11694 (as you already saw).\u00a0 I'll need to discuss with my IBM colleagues and see what we want to do going forward.\u00a0 Like I said, this is a feature we've built production applications on top of and removing it is just plain \"not cool\".\u00a0 There were other ways it could've been cleaned up and maintained without removing it.\n\nAs a whole, I'm really disappointed in this decision from the Solr community, as I never heard of pulling out a function that works absolutely fine.\u00a0 The reason that I would say its not \"maintained\" is that there's nothing wrong with the current feature.\u00a0 If anything, it could be upgraded to a later UIMAJ but even that is easily worked around.\u00a0 I really see this as a big step backwards for Solr with regards to text analytics.

            "content": "Hi Aaron,\n\nIt is great to hear that there would be a healthy discussion about this. Please feel free to share the outcome of this on the developer list and it may spark further developers discussion too. Nothing is set in stone, given enough evidence to the contrary.\n\nStill, just to re-summarize, the issue we were facing was that all the shipped examples were dead (Alchemy API...) and over multiple issues we could not figure out\u00a0a way\u00a0to get to the new local maximum of latest version and useful examples (UIMA has a bit of a learning curve). Nor were we able to find anybody helping us to push the discussion forward within either development community (Jira discussions) or the user community (Solr Users mailing list).\n\nAdditionally, we are trying to slim Solr down in general and have done several things towards that, including removing Javadoc from the distribution. If you were more closely connected to the community, you would see multiple of these drives all pointing in the same general direction. So, having a dead weight we could not figure what to do with over several years was very much \"not cool\" on all those users downloading Solr and trying to navigate their way through very full-featured product.\u00a0\n\nAnd then, of course, there is a fact that we now incorporate Apache OpenNLP as well. So, there are trade-offs to keep in mind.\n\n\u00a0 ",

            "content": "Hi Alexandre, thank for you the additional detail and background.\u00a0 While I understand the goal here, I don't agree with how the end result was achieved.\u00a0 I think the real \"issue\" here was that the examples and documentation are stale.\u00a0 Likewise, UIMA core can (and should) be upgraded to the latest 2.10.2, and the additional unnecessary dependencies should absolutely be removed from the dist.\u00a0 I'm attaching a simple patch (SOLR-12789-4.patch) that does just this.\u00a0 I would like to propose that we re-instate the contrib/uima project and apply my patch instead.\u00a0 I think this is a fair compromise since 6 Java classes doesn't quite compromise as \"dead weight\", especially if those 6 classes provide direct end-user value.\u00a0 While I would certain agree, UIMA has a steep learning curve, there are folks out there that are using it, and removing it entirely from the Solr dist is likely to do a disservice to those folks who are in-fact doing text analytics using it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll that being said, I think the only thing that really remains is a clean-up of the documentation and examples.\u00a0 I'm happy to do that over the next couple weeks if we agree to this strategy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks so much.\n\n\u00a0 ",
