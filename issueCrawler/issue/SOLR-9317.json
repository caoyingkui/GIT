            "content": "I've run into a roadblock fixing SOLR-12756 where create shard command finds replica positions for all replicas in the shard and then calls add replica 1-by-1 for each position. This is to ensure that it is possible to place all replicas before attempting to create even one. However, then add replica skips finding replica positions only if policy engine is being used. This means that we cannot get rid of this special case from add replica until and unless we fix this issue.\n\nThankfully, this is easy because the logic and code to do this is already inside Create Shard Command. So this is a matter of migrating the logic to add replica and making create shard a thin wrapper around add replica API. ",
