Unfortunately, I introduced bugs by doing so...\n\nDaniel Collins, the workaround here is the same as the workaround mentioned in SOLR-4567 description: simply enumerate all sources you want to copy, e.g.:\n\n\n<copyField source=\"headline_en\" dest=\"headline\"/>\n<copyField source=\"headline_ja\" dest=\"headline\"/>\n...\n\n "

AFAICT, there is no way to align the copyField source in your scenario to declared dynamic or explicit fields, and changes I introduced in SOLR-3798 and SOLR-4567 assume that non-aligned copyField sources are errors.\n\nI think this is more than the \"subset pattern\" as defined in SOLR-4567, but I can't see any other way to do what we want (and it used to work!)\n\nYup, it's definitely a regression.
