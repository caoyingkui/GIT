    "description": "It is possible that the cluster is operating sub optimally with more nodes than required. It is not possible for Solr to automatically identify a suboptimal utilization of nodes.\u00a0\u00a0We expect the user to provide us with policy rules to identify it\n\nexamples:\n\n {\"cores\" : \">2\", \"node\":\"#ANY\" , \"strict\" : false\u00a0}\n {\"freedisk\" : \"<10\", \"node\":\"#ANY\" , \"strict\": false}\n\n\nSolr would go through all these rules to identify if it breaks any such rules. If yes, it would go through the following steps\n\n\tIdentify all violations to such rules\n\tSort all nodes and identify the least loaded nodes\n\tIf there is an empty node\n\t\n\t\tstore that node name\n\t\tSimulate removal of that node and go to step #1\n\t\n\t\n\tCheck if they are violating these rules\n\tif yes, simulate moving them to other nodes with more load\n\tif it is possible, to move without breaking rules,\n\t\n\t\tstore that suggestion\n\t\tGo to step #1\n\t\n\t\n\tIf not possible, get the list of move operations (step #6.1) and collect the list of nodes to be removed ( step # 3.1)",
