            "content": "This patch changes the DocIdSetBuilder API. add() is gone. Instead, grow() returns a new BulkAdder object that can be used to add up to the number of documents that have been passed to the grow() method. This helps save conditionals since the add method never needs to care about whether the buffer is large enough or whether to upgrade to a bitset since everything is done up-front in the grow() call.

            "content": "One possible downside to this change is that it changes a predictable branch (that is handled at the CPU level) into a method call... which if it's not monomorphic can be un-inlined at the point of the call and thus end up slower (method call vs predictable branch).  Will be interesting to see the benchmark results. "

            "content": "I benchmarked it using IndexAndSearchOpenStreetMaps by temporarily using DocIdSetBuilder instead of MatchingPoints (I did not use luceneutil since its numeric range queries match too many docs). The QPS went from 33.4 (old DocIdSetBuilder.add) to 35.0 with this patch.\n\nIn that case I think it works well since the base class is an abstract class and there are only two impls, which the JVM can efficiently optimize. (For the record, most queries of the benchmark upgrade to a bitset so both impls are used.) "
