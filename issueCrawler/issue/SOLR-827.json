    "description": "This is closely related to SOLR-803.  In that issue, creating new cores failed because \"core\" parameter was set instead of \"name\".  As it turns out, the CREATE action uses \"name\" and all other actions use \"core\".  This means that the fix to 803 would have also been a break to the others.\n\nDocumentation on parameters for certain actions:\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/CoreAdmin#head-c6dd6a81d9af0c12de8c160fbfa82fe2c5411e71\n\nI have a patch ready.",
