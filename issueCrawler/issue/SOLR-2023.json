    "description": "Today I had to debug the JSONResponseWriter and I was a little bit confused about all these writeNamedListAs... methods. Therefore I cleaned up these methods to point the differences out. I added some tests to verify that nothing has changed.\n\nMaybe you should delete the method writeNamedListAsMapMangled(...), because nobody uses it and it blows up the code.",
