            "content": "here is an initial patch that cuts over the API to use a ReaderInfo struct. I upload that patch to get initial feedback for this rather massive change. Before i fix all JavaDoc etc. some others should review that first. The patch contains the following changes:\n\n\n\tCut over to use ReaderInfo in Weight#scorer, Weight#explain & Filter.getDocIdSet\n\tAdded ReaderInfo[] to IndexReader and its subclasses as well as IndexSearcher and Searcher which just forwards if applicable.\n\tFixed several, IMO legacy implementations in Solr code that still fixed the doc offset in explain\n\tRemoved all uses of SolrIndexReader#leaveReaders outside of SIR - IMO we can make those private to SIR now.\n\tAdded a DummySearcher to QueryWrapperFilter since it uses the subreader to obtain the weight from a query. That didn't work anymore since I assert now that\n  the parent readers are identical in Weight#scorer\n\tcut over IndexSearcher to use ReaderInfo instead of seq. subreader\n\n\n\nWhat is definitly missing here from my point of view is:\n\n\n\tsharpen the javadoc in weight, filter, and query to make clear how Weight, Rewrite & Scorer play together. For instance it should be clear that a query should only be executed against the same reader it was rewritten against.\n\tpossibly revise the getSeqSub & getSeqDocBase API in IR and maybe merge then in ReaderInfo\n\tWe should think about what we need in Scorer and Filter before we commit since this already changes the interface so we can do it here though. For instance could we include a needsScoring flag in either Query#weight() or in the Weight#scorer() method. One other way would be to add those flags to the struct\nthat is passed in but that would mean that we can not simply bind them to the IR and use them from there.\n\tmaybe think about the name ReaderContext sounds also good instead  of ReaderInfo\n\n\n\n\ncomments welcome!!

            "content": "I think we should add the sub-ReaderInfos too, so the tree is\ndoubly-linked?\n\nYeah, sounds like a good idea.  Solr currently has this functionality via SolrIndexReader (all lucene readers in the tree are wrapped on every reopen), and every SolrIndexReader has the list of children, and a parent pointer.  So this is turning into the same thing, just with a parallel data structure (which mirrors the actual reader tree) instead of wrapping.\n\n Actually I think we can and should store this in IndexReader?\n\nBut, only the top-level reader is allowed to hold ReaderInfo for all\nsubs it [recurisvely] contains. \n\nA top level reader may also be a sub-reader of another top level reader... so it doesn't seem\nlike we can make that restriction, and any ReaderInfo stored on an IndexReader would only be valid\nin some contexts.  Think about simply trying to walk up to the top level reader, or using \"offset\"\nor \"ord' which vary depending on the top-level reader.\n\nAnd if that info is passed down to weight() and scorer() anyway, what's the point of storing it on IR?\nI guess if we made the restriction that things that vary depending on top-level reader should be avoided\nin ReaderInfo if obtained directly from an IndexReader, it would be OK.  But that's a severe and strange restriction.\n\nWe can try approaching it from the other direction too... what is gained or made easier by storing ReaderInfo on IR?  What are the usecases? ",

Ie it would allow for a sub that's shared in different top readers.\n\nI think what yonik it saying it that you can not be sure that the topLevelReader is a TopLevelReader since it could have yet another parent.\nThis will always be true and essentially only well defined in the context of an IndexSearcher. IndexSearcher takes an arbitrary IndexReader as a topLevel and this will be the one for this IS context. The same IR could be a sub-reader in a different context though.\n\nI'm tend to lean towards holding ReaderInfo on IndexSearcher rather than on IndexReader. It is really an information that 100% depends on a context which is given by IS. IS also defines the context for Query#weigth / createWeight and Weight ctors and with LUCENE-2837 we can eventually rely on the given Searcher is an IS. \n\nAnother thing to think about is if this should be unified with the very similar ReaderUtil.Slice\nI agree this should be easy to obtain. \n\nSolrIndexReader could be removed altogether if this is solved correctly - it's only real purpose was really to solve this context problem.\nyeah this makes sense. I didn't look into it too deep during the first patch. \n\nI think we should give Yoniks full ReaderInfo a go an create it only in IS. This might make some Solr classes go away too and reduce complexity. I will go ahead and work on a new patch soon. ",

            "content": "The same IR could be a sub-reader in a different context though.\n\nRight, but that's perfectly fine w/ the proposed API.\n\nIe, any IR is able to be a top reader if you ask it to.  So you can\ncall IR.getTopReaderInfo(), and this will fill in the full tree as\nseen by that top reader only.  Meaning, the resulting tree is\n\"private\" to that reader.  If you go and ask another reader for its\ntree, a new tree (private to that reader's \"view\" (parent/child\nrelationships)) is computed.\n\nThe API is fully general: it allows for readers that are shared by\nmore than one top reader.\n\nReally (as Yonik said before) this is a question of caching.  It's\ngonna be the same tree, whether it's stored on IR or IS.  Yet, the\ntree in no way depends on IS \u2013 it's entirely a function of the\nrelationships b/w IR and its subs.  An app should be able to store the\ntop IR, and pull the tree from it on demand.  And init'ing an IS from\nan IR should continue to be cheap.\n\nAlso, looking towards the future... at some point we will split apart\n\"composite reader\" and \"atomic reader\".  Ie, these really should be\nseparate classes, but today in Lucene they are one and the same and so\nwe have \"dynamic typing\" (you hit exceptions at runtime) instead of\nstatic typing (compilation errors).  At some point we have to fix this\nand make these two IRs separately classes.\n\nBut to say that this API should be moved to IS instead of IR because\nof this dynamic/static typing problem is a step in the wrong direction\n\u2013 ie once we split out these two IR classes we'll want to move the\nthe getTopReaderInfo API back to the \"composite\" IR.\n\nBTW we will have to somehow fix CachingWrapperFilter to behave\nproperly here.  Ie, it needs to know whether the cache key is purely\nthe sub-reader (as it is, always, today), or the combo of root reader\n+ sub (as it is for eg DuplicateFilter).\n ",

Yet, what's problematic here is that it takes more than one leaf which kills the sematics of methods like IS#docFreq() as you figured out on IRC. If the parents reader is used for a searcher that only operates on partial leaves we have a problem.
