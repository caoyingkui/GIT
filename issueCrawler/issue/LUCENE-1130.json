    "description": "More testing of RC2 ...\n\nI found one case, if you hit disk full during init() in\nDocumentsWriter.ThreadState, when we first create the term vectors &\nfields writer, such that subsequent calls to\nIndexWriter.add/updateDocument will then hang forever.\n\nWhat's happening in this case is we are incrementing nextDocID even\nthough we never call finishDocument (because we \"thought\" init did not\nsucceed).  Then, when we finish the next document, it will never\nactually write because missing finishDocument call never happens.",
