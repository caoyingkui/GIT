Make sure that the norms copied are not the same for all those documents though. It's very possible they are all the same as the test indices contains very small and similar texts. It would also be great if the norms copied spans over the deleted documents in the second run. \n\n(The second testEquals() iteration is not committed yet, only available in the LUCENE-1312 patch right now. Let's commit that first.)\n\nI'll add the above mentioned tests if you don't. ",
