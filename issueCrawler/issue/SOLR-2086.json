    "description": "The analysis.jsp ignores the maxFieldLength setting when analyzing.  I passed in a block of text that was 102524 tokens, and it analyzed all of them, even though maxFieldLength was 10000.  The difference in results is pretty drastic between analysis.jsp and adding a document directly.  \n\nAlso, the GUI pretty much melts down with lots and lots of tokens as well, so maxFieldLength helps here as well.",
