(Few trials make sense because with sampling, there is always a possibility that the selected sample set of docs would not contain the \"correct\" best facets even with a high over sampling ratio (over sampling means that for the selected set of docs more best facets are collected).\n\n\n\n\n\tEven after fixing the test to actually try more than once, it still fails, because there is no randomness in RandomSample...  surprising but true.\n\n\n\nIn this patch:\n\n\tSampler made an abstract class.\n\tRandomSample renamed to RepeatableSampler which extends Sampler.\n\tRandomSampler was added - it too extends Sampler - this is a simple random implementation, which is now the default (used by default in SamplingWrapperAccumulator).\n\tThe test randomly selects between the two sampler implementations. If you want to see the behavior that created the bug, remove that latter randomness by setting to false the variable useRandomSampler of BaseSampleTestTopK.testCountUsingSamping().\n\n\n\nI think this is ready to commit. \nWasn't sure though, where should the Changes entry go?

And have assertSameResult throw RuntimeException. Calling fail() from there, forcing you to handle Errors, seem too low-level to me ...\n\n\n\n\n\tIn AdaptiveFacetsAccumulator you have this line: //private Sampler sampler = new RepeatableSampler();. Is it a leftover?\n\n\n\n\n\tMaybe add a line or two to RandomSample.createSample() (internal comments), such as:\n\t\n\t\t\"Skip over 'step' documents\" before the for-loop\n\t\t\"Add all leftover documents to the sampled set\" before last 'while'.\n(Please also confirm my understanding) \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tCHANGES - in this case you only need a CHANGES entry for 3x (since the change is applied to there as well), and it is under contrib.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, it looks very good !
