    "description": "Today our behavior is weird: we will fail the merge (which is running in a background thread if you are using the default CMS), pause for 1.0 seconds, and then the next chance we get, kick off the merge again.\n\nI think this is a poor default, e.g. on disk full we will just keep \"trying\" and filling up disk again, wasting IO/CPU.\n\nI think IW should declare this a tragedy instead?",

            "content": "Here's a tentative patch ... it was tricky because calling IW.tragicEvent from a merge thread quickly lead to deadlock.  I had to relax a few locking/blocking places to work around that ...\n\nI also had to fix some tests to expected that IW is closed after hitting a merge exc, but I'm sure there's a long tail still there ... this will be destabilizing at first.\n\nI still need to add a dedicated test that confirms IW is closed after a merge exc.
