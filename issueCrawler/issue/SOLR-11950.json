However, when specifying a comma delimited list, it is treated as a single value instead of being parsed into multiple values.\n\nThe request\n\n.../collections?action=CLUSTERSTATUS&collection=test_collection&shard=shard1,shard2\n\nyields the response:\n{\"responseHeader\":\\{\"status\":400,\"QTime\":5}\n,\"error\":{\"metadata\":[\"error-class\",\"org.apache.solr.common.SolrException\",\"root-error-class\",\"org.apache.solr.common.SolrException\"],\"msg\":\"Collection: test_collection shard: shard1,shard2 not found\",\"code\":400}}\ninstead of locating both shard1 and shard2.",
