An example of such a plugin could be the couchbase indexer which is added as a couch replica and then data is pushed to such a plugin by couchdb automatically. We wouldn't want all the replicas in Solr to start such a plugin automatically. Even if we enable/disable the plugin via an API, we would still want automatic failover if the node running the plugin went down.",
