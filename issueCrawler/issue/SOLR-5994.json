Out in production environments it would be extremely odd that users will be pushing out the javadocs with the rest of their configuration, thus resulting in an aggravating 404 page. I believe Jetty will show the various contexts when hitting the root ie http://localhost:8080 \u2013 this would then show you links for /javadoc & /solr which would probably be sufficient. "

In any case, this is an enhancement, not bug fix, so a less relevant part of conversation.\n\nAdmin link: Jetty will show the contexts when hitting root. So, that could be minimal setup.\n\nI agree on not expecting Javadoc in production. For example distribution, it might be possible to use those admin-extra files to add the links for the Javadoc (and online reference guide). Unless the various re-distributions keep the example files but not Javadoc. But I don't know if those re-distributions (e.g. Bitname) already break other expectations too. \n\nIf it were possible to integrate directly, a nice place to do the link to Javadocs would be in something like an Analysis page and in Schema Browser. Then, it becomes really important that the Javadoc is on the save server. "

If that happens, From what I can tell the apache-hosted javadocs for Lucene and Solr are NOT searchable, so it would be really cool if Solr could index them and provide a search box.\n\nRealizing that we are likely to remove javadocs from the primary download, it would only be something that becomes available once the javadocs are downloaded into the correct location.  Looking forward to a time when we might have a plugin architecture that automatically downloads and installs plugins, javadocs could be one of those plugins. "
