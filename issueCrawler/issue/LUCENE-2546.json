            "content": "this removes the \"tokenStream variable hidden\" warning in NumericField, and in general is the better approach to an unused variable in AbstractField. There are subclasses that have specific tokenstreams and their impls should not be encumbered by abstractfields variable declaration.\n\nIn this case, Field is the only class that actually uses tokenStream without overwriting it with a local private member. So i simply removed the variable from AbstractField and added it to Field.\n\nthis is mostly cosmetic, but coding bugs can arrise from these kind of variable hiding issues. ",
