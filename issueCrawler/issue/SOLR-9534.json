    "description": "Spinoff from SOLR-6677\n\nLet's make it much easier to \"turn on debug\" by supporting a bin/solr start -V verbose option, and likewise a bin/solr start -q for quiet operation.\n\nThese would simply be convenience options for changing the RootLogger from level INFO to DEBUG or WARN respectively. This can be done programmatically in log4j at startup. \n\nCould be we need to add some more package specific defaults in log4j.properties to get the right mix of logs",

            "content": "Attaching patch:\n\n\n\tWe support the new environment variable SOLR_LOG_LEVEL which may be set either in solr.in.cmd|sh or in the shell. If the start scripts finds a value for SOLR_LOG_LEVEL it will pass it on to Solr as option -Dsolr.log.level=$SOLR_LOG_LEVEL\n\tIn SolrDispatchFilter.init() we check the option, and change the rootLogger level programmatically\n\tAdds two new arguments to bin/solr[.cmd]: -v and -q which sets SOLR_LOG_LEVEL to DEBUG and WARN respectively. These will override whatever set in the environment.\n\n\n\nSo now you don't need to understand Log4J or dig to find the correct log config to make Solr verbose or quiet.\n\nOnly Linux script tested. Would be grateful if someone would take solr.cmd for a ride. I do not validate the env.var, but a single-word invalid level will simply select the default which is INFO. ",
