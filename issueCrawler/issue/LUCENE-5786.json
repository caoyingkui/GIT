    "description": "This has happened several times on Jenkins, typically on SSLMigrationTest.testDistribSearch, but probably on other tests as well.\n\nThe symptom is: the test framework never terminates, it also reports an incorrect  hung test.\n\nThe problem is that the actual forked JVM is hung on reading stdin, waiting for the next test suite (no test thread is present); the master process is hung on receiving data from the forked jvm (both the events file and stdout spill is truncated in the middle of a test). The last output is:\n\n\n[\n  \"APPEND_STDERR\",\n  {\n    \"chunk\": \"612639 T30203 oasu.DefaultSolrCoreState.doRecovery Running recovery - first canceling any ongoing recovery%0A\"\n  }\n]\n\n[\n  \"APPEND_STDERR\"\n\n\n\nOverall, it looks insane \u2013 there are flushes after each test completes (normally or not), there are tests following the one that last reported output and before dynamic suites on stdin. \n\nI have no idea. The best explanation is insane \u2013 looks like the test thread just died in the middle of executing Java code...",

            "content": "I think this may actually be a bug in RR code. Here's why \u2013 writing is done via RandomAccessFile and it used to have flush() method but at some point it was commented out:\n\n   @Override\n   public void flush() throws IOException {\n-    raf.getChannel().force(true);\n+    // This was causing intermittent channel invalidations on Windows for\n+    // no apparent reason. Also, it shouldn't be a problem if we don't sync\n+    // with the disk (and use OS cache only)?\n+    // raf.getChannel().force(true);\n   }\n\n\n\nSo it either randomly fails on Windows or it will not sync properly on FreeBSD. Nice. I'll revert to simple FileOutputStream and see if this improves things. ",
