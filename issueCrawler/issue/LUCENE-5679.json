I'll sun jdocs tests too, though eclipse showed no additional errors about referencing those methods.\n\nDo you think it's OK to backport to 4x? The only concern I have is if apps will upgrade to e.g. 4.9 by only dropping the 4.9 jar, not compiling their code as well. I don't know if people still do that though ... . Anyway, if we want to keep that, we can deprecate them in 4x. ",

In 4.x I would keep the one-arg methods, but just let it delegate to the vararg version. The javadocs can stay the same.\nIn fact this change requires to recompile your source-code (source-code compatibility is ensured) but does not provide binary compatibility.\n\nUwe ",
