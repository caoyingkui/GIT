These documents/records belong to various sources like, source1, source2 etc (stored in 'Source' Solr field). Now, when user searches for documents (simple text search) then, is there any possibilities in Solr so that results of certain sources always come with lower rank? (ie, such sources always come in trailing pages).\n\nI believe, there should be some way for this in functional query but not sure!\n\nAny help on this is greately appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",
