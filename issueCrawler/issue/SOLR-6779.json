Still, \"not a production\" scenario, but at least no need for another set of libraries. \n\nOh, and whatever changes are done to those .vm files, they need to be in all of the examples, right?

That's like saying wt=json isn't suited for a production environment.  It all really depends on how you use it.  I have a first hand account of a huge job search site that uses wt=velocity for generating e-mails; and yeah, that's not generating a direct to users browser view, but it's still \"UI\" and a quite clever and valid use case. \n\nNo, you should not expose Solr to end users, JSON or XML or any other response format.  But that does not mean it's not \"for production\", again depends on how you define it and use it.  \n\nIf one were so inclined,  you could front Solr with a proxy/firewall to prevent updates or other malicious or unintended uses and have the UI come from wt=velocity even.  Totally production quality in that case. ",

But there is no easy official example of that smart proxy/firewall rules (some random GitHub configs do exists), so it is not fair to give a nuanced answer without holding the hand on making it happen.

Again, wt=velocity is no different than wt=json.   \n\nPoint taken, of course, just wanted to, again, attempt to dispel what I can about /browse.  Certainly it was intended as a prototype / playground for the techproducts data example, but it's more than just that.  One of the things I'm working on and alluded to in e-mail recently was to pull the templates out of conf/velocity and get basic ones baked into either the solr-velocity JAR or into a separate JAR.  It's probably little known that wt=velocity can serve templates from the SolrResourceLoader (i.e. the plugins).  One of the goals has always been to have plugins be able to have their own UI bits, and wt=velocity has supported that since day one.  I'll do more to showcase this in 5.x (hopefully in time for 5.0 even), with template overridability (already supported) too.  More on this in a few weeks. ",
