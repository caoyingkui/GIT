Didn't look too deeply though; if somebody has the time to check out the differences and maybe compare the estimation differences it'd be nice.\n\nThere is also another tool by Aleksey Shipilev. It looks very good to me (Aleksey has deep knowledge of JVM internals).\nhttps://github.com/shipilev/java-object-layout/",
