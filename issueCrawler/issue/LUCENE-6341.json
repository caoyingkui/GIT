    "description": "CheckIndex is great for testing and when tracking down lucene bugs. \n\nBut in cases where users just want to verify their index files are OK, it is very slow and expensive.\n\nI think we should add a -fast option, that only opens the reader and calls checkIntegrity(). This means all files are the correct files (identifiers match) and have the correct CRC32 checksums.\n\nFor our 10M doc wikipedia index, this is the difference between a 2 second check and a 2 minute check.",

For lucene 4.0-4.7 segments, which are supported there, the option is kind of trappy, maybe just a warning beside the option's usage() in 5.x branch is ok since its not set by default anyway? "

Reader open is doing this check.\n\nRight, I just mean the usage output (\"-fast: just verify file checksums, omitting logical integrity checks\") is selling this option short because we do more than just verify file checksums.
