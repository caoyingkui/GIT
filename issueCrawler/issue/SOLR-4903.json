    "description": "Setup: front end solr and shards.\n\nSummary: solr frontend sends all doc ids received from QueryComponent to all shards which causes POST request buffer size overflow.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nThe query is: http://pastebin.com/0DndK1Cs\nI have omitted the shards parameter.\n\nThe router log: http://pastebin.com/FTVH1WF3\nNotice the port of a shard, that is affected. That port changes all the time, even for the same request\nThe log entry is prepended with lines:\n\nSEVERE: org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Internal Server Error\n\nInternal Server Error\n\n(they are not in the pastebin link)\n\nThe shard log: http://pastebin.com/exwCx3LX\n\nSuggestion: change the data structure in FacetComponent to send only doc ids that belong to a shard and not a concatenation of all doc ids.\n\nWhy is this important: for scaling. Adding more shards will result in overflowing the POST request buffer at some point anyway.",
