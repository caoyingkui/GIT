    "description": "Similar to SOLR-324, add in sorting support for byte and shorts.  Most of the code is in the SOLR-324.patch file, just needs to have proper support from Lucene.  Lucene trunk has the capability, but it was not in the last release.  Either update to trunk at some point or wait for the next Lucene release.",
