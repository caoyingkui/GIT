    "description": "I am not sure if this issue requires a fix due to the nature of its occurrence, or if it exists in other versions of Lucene.\n\nI am using Lucene Java 3.0.3 on a SUSE Linux machine with Java 6 and have noticed there are a number of file handles that are not being released from my java application. There are IOExceptions in my log regarding disk full, which causes a merge and the optimization to fail. The index is not currupt upon encountering the IOException. I am using CFS for my index format, so 3X my largest index size during optimization certainly consumes all of my available disk. \n\nI realize that I need to add more disk space to my machine, but I investigated how to clean up the leaking file handles. After failing to find a misuse of Lucene's IndexWriter in the code I have wrapping Lucene, I did a quick search for close() being invoked in the Lucene Jave source code. I found a number of source files that attempt to close more than one object within the same close() method. I think a try/catch should be put around each of these close() attempts to avoid skipping a subsequent closes. The catch may be able to ignore a caught exception to avoid masking the original exception like done in SimpleFSDirectory.close().\n\nLocations in Lucene Java source where I suggest a try/catch should be used:\n\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.FormatPostingFieldsWriter.finish()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.TermInfosWriter.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.SegmentTermPositions.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMergeInfo.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMerger.mergeTerms() (The finally block)\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.FieldsReader.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.MultiLevelSkipListReader.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.MultipleTermPositions.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMergeQueue.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMergeDocs.close()\n\torg.apache.lucene.index.TermInfosReader.close()",
