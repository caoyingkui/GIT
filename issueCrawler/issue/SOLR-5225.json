There are some dangers introduced, however.\n\nHere is the current description of this functionality on CREATE:\n\n\"collection.<param>=<value> - causes a property of <param>=<value> to be set if a new collection is being created.\"\n\n@http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrCloud#Creating_cores_via_CoreAdmin",
