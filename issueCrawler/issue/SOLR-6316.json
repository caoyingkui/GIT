            "content": "Some more info about patch.\n\nIt's funny actually. If you run 'details' command you get no information about backup, if you don't previously run 'backup' command. That is because SnapShooter object is created with that command. That is why I have introduced new command 'listbackups' that takes optional parameter 'location'. It lists number of available backups in current or selected location and also their names.\n\nI have also added information about location under 'details' command (backup section) because it depends whether you used location param in last backup command. \n\nI always say, more information is better than less.
