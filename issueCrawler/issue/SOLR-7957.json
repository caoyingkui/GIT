    "description": "Today we have a ResultContext which simply has two public variables query and docList.  For writing a response, those fields are used to create a DocsStreamer which creates a TransformContext for transformers (which just copies the values like searcher, req, q, etc again).\n\nIt seems the all the methods on TransformContext could be simply moved to ResultContext.\n\nOnly exception is \"iterator\" needed by ScoreAugmenter, but we could simply pass down the score in the transform() method as well.\n\nThis would result in a ResultContext that could do things like support multiple queries with different return fields, and things like returning a list of docs from another core (think cross-core join).",

            "content": "OK, here's a patch that puts  enough info into ResultContext to allow for multiple queries per request.  Since the ResultContext carries all of the info that was previously in TransformContext, the latter was redundant and hence was removed.\n\nResponseWriters now ask for an iterator over the results from the ResultContext itself, expanding future options (as opposed to hard-coding DocStreamer).\n\nThis doesn't address all of the issues with transformers, etc...  we don't have a good answer for transformers that would benefit from batching, and transformers aren't thread safe (they can't be used concurrently in different threads).  But I think allowing multiple queries per request is a good start. ",
