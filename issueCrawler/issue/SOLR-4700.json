    "description": "If we moved the client API base URLs to their own URL namespace, it would free up the 'top level' URL namespace for other uses.  This would mean moving http://host:port/solr/YYY to http://host:port/solr/XXX/YYY - where YYY is a core or collection name and XXX is some string yet to be determined.\n\nThe existing URL setup is so widely used that we probably would not be able to remove backwards compatibility until at least 6.0.\n\nSee discussion on SOLR-4431.",

After I had that thought, I realized it might make it even harder for this issue to gain support, because it would remove URL consistency and add complexity to client code. I'm just putting the thought out there, not making it an official part of my proposal at this time. "
