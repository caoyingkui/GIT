The next time you run a build, ivy will hang with \"resolve:\" on the screen.\n\nThe ivy project has a fix, currently not yet released.  When it does get released, the version installed by the ivy-bootstrap target needs to be updated.",

I checked out and compiled the 2.3.x branch, then replaced the trunk version that was in ~/.ant/lib.  Looks like the hang problem is fixed - I tried several times to trigger the lockfile bug with ctrl-c while ivy was downloading files. ",
