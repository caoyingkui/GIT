            "content": "First cut of compute plan action. There are some impedance mismatches between the node added event and the policy framework that need to be fixed before we proceed further, such as:\n\n\tIt should be possible to create a Suggester without knowing the collection and shard names) \u2013 when a node is added, all we know is that the default implicit action is MOVEREPLICA but we don't know which collection/shard should be moved to the new node\n\tAn easier, perhaps iterator like API for generating multiple operations in a row \u2013 when a node is added, multiple movereplica operations might be performed to balance the cluster.\n\tThe policy API should consume a hint from the trigger e.g. the node name which was added instead of trying to figure such things by itself looking at the cluster state or metrics.\n\n\n\nThe TriggerAction API also needs refactoring as it is needlessly complex to implement an action and we need a way to consume information from preceding steps as well as pass along information to the next actions in the chain.
