            "content": "This version has a few problems:\n\n\tThe UI boxes-within-boxes problem needs a CSS workover.\n\tIt uses a new <requestHandler>  element in solrconfig.xml, since it exercises all available components.\n\tThe system of supressing dependent parameters is brittle. It could be replaced with code that, given an input item named 'x', searches for parameters name 'x.*'.\n\n\n\nAll of the new parsers deserve a separate exploratory page, as do the geographic features.
