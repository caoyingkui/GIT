            "content": "The attached patch extends upon SOLR-9122 and SOLR-9123 to support use of ExactStatsCache with grouped results. The test cases have been extended to demonstrate the problem with grouped results and then fix the problem by enabling it in the query evaluation phases.\n\nBecause the code branches used for grouped and ungrouped queries differs for the common elements such as sorting this still lead to an unfortunate scenario where documents with the same score are not ordered across and within groups in the same manner (eg shard index and then position in results as secondary and tertiary sorting criteria). This means some of the test cases are resorting items to look for the correct scores but cannot rely upon the native sorting.\n\nThe patch is against the 5.x branch and built upon the patch with SOLR-9122 and SOLR-9123 but should be straightforward to apply to the master.
