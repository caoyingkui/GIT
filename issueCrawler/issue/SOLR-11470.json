    "description": "Overview\n\nNegatives queries (ex. q=NOT foo) always return \"No Results\" with rq parameter (ex. rq={!rerank reRankQuery=bar}). This is because QueryUtils#makeQueryable doesn't consider RankQuery and fails to modify wrapped pure negative queries to searchable ones (ex. modifies q=NOT foo to q=(NOT foo) AND *:*). Pure negative queries are rewritten as MatchNoDocsQuery by BooleanQuery#rewrite and this results in numFound=\"0\".\n\nHow to reproduce\n\n\n\tPrepare solr server according to Solr Tutorial.\n\tSearch with /solr/techproducts/query?q=NOT foo. This returns 52 documents as the result.\n\tSearch with /solr/techproducts/query?q=NOT foo&rq={!rerank reRankQuery=bar}. This returns 0 document (52 documents are expected though...) as the result.\n\n\n\nHow to fix\n\nAdd new API RankQuery#getMainQuery to be able to get the wrapped query from RankQuery, and use it in QueryUtils#makeQueryable to fix the original query if given argument Query q is instance of RankQuery.",
