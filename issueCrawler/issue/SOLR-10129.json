            "content": "Here's a patch, currently applying on top of 6x - I'll port it forward to master if everybody's happy.\n\nFields can have up to 4 range dimensions, and are of the following format:\n\n[10 TO 15, 0 TO MAX, MIN TO 8, 14]\n\n\n\nMIN and MAX allow for open ranges, and degenerate ranges of a single value are permitted.\n\nQuerying uses a special PointRange query parser, like so:\n\n{!pr field=field method=contains}[range]\n\n\n\nPermitted methods are contains, within and intersects.

I think we should be more defensive while parsing the ranges, be able to handle and error on invalid inputs. \nI'm not sure we should call the query parser PointRangeQParserPlugin, the \"points\" part is just an implementation detail, these are just ranges, right? Why not just  RangeQParserPlugin? ",
