One thing: It does not actually ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsEx in the filter because of the way how CharTermAttributeImpl is implemented internally, but theoretically there is a length check missing. The nUpper/tUpper stuff can get out of bounds if the length of term in 0 or 1 (which are valid length). But thats only a minor complaint about the code. Otherwise looks great. Just appearing from no irish support at all! really needed! \n\nUwe ",

You can visualize this at http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/breaks.jsp\n\nThis means we can add many spurious 'n' tokens in the index...\n\nSo we have two potential solutions to this:\n\n\twe can simply add 'n', 'h', 't', etc to the stopwords list. This is the simplest solution. Would this be too aggressive?\n\twe can add a CharFilter for IrishAnalyzer to prevent this splitting from happening. This is more complex.\n\n ",

Is there actually usually a hyphen here?\n(Wikipedia says no, playing around with GaelSpell seems to agree, but I don't know anything about this language!)\nWould this case be too aggressive to handle?

I can send you those data - non-prefixes might be more common than you'd think in running text bc of proper names, English mixed in, etc.  So upshot is it's a bad idea to strip all initial h's with no hyphen following. \n  As far as h- (with hyphen) goes, it's non-standard but common enough that I'd leave it in the stemmer.   Not like there would be false positives in that case if the hyphen is there.' ",
