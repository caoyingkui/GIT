    "description": "Direct construction of StopWordFilter is not backwards compatible between 1.2 and 1.3.  Here is some test code that throws a null pointer exception in 1.3 but that functions correctly in 1.2.\n\n     TokenizerFactory tokenizer = new WhitespaceTokenizerFactory();\n\n      Map<String, String> args = new HashMap<String, String>();\n      args.put(\"ignoreCase\", \"true\");\n      args.put(\"words\", \"stopwords.txt\");\n      StopFilterFactory stopFilter = new StopFilterFactory();\n      stopFilter.init(args);\n\n     args = new HashMap<String, String>();\n     args.put(\"generateWordParts\", \"1\");\n     args.put(\"generateNumberParts\", \"1\");\n     args.put(\"catenateWords\", \"0\");\n     args.put(\"catenateNumbers\", \"0\");\n     args.put(\"catenateAll\", \"0\");\n     WordDelimiterFilterFactory wordFilter = new WordDelimiterFilterFactory();\n     wordFilter.init(args);\n\n     TokenFilterFactory[] filters = new TokenFilterFactory[] \n{stopFilter, wordFilter }\n;\n     TokenizerChain pipeline =TokenizerChain(tokenizer, filters);\n\n     /*** throws a null pointer exception in 1.3: ***/\n    boolean onlyStopWords = pipeline.tokenStream(null, new StringReader(query)).next() == null;\n\nHoss commented thusly in the solr forums (including a workaround):\n\nThe short answer is: right after you call \"stopFilter.init(args)\" call\n\"stopFilter.inform(solrCore.getSolrConfig().getResourceLoader());\"\n\nThis is an interesting use case that wasn't really considered when we\nswitched away from using hte SolrCore singlton and the the\nResourceLoaderAware interface was added.  we made sure things would still\nwork for people who had their own custom Analysis Factories, but some of\nthe functionality in existing Factories was moved from the init() method\nto inform() ... which means the classes aren't technically backwards\ncompatibly for people doing what you're doing: constructing them directly.\n\nWhen I have some more time, i'll spin up a thread on solr-dev to discuss\nwhat we should do about this \u2013 n the mean time feel free to file a bug\nthat StopFilter isn't backwards compatible.",
