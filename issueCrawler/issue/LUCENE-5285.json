    "description": "FastVectorHighlighter copies segments scores when splitting segments across multi-valued fields.  This is only a problem when you want to sort the fragments by score. Technically BaseFragmentsBuilder (line 261 in my copy of the source) does the copying.\n\nRather than copying the score I think it'd be more right to pull that copying logic into a protected method that child classes (such as ScoreOrderFragmentsBuilder) can override to do more intelligent things.  Exactly what that means isn't clear to me at the moment.",
