    "description": "HossmanSays: \"ant compile\" in lucene src artifacts builds jars for some contribs not\n  all \u2013 kind of confusing.  I did a double take before i realized i\n  needed \"build-contrib\" to get them all and the ones i was seeing were just\n  because of cross-contrb dependencies.\n\nBasically the ant -p is confusing in general. The 'default' task is actually 'jar-core',\nwhich makes jars, but it has no description (doesnt show up in project help), and neither\ndoes 'jar' (which maps to jar-core).\n\nsolr/build.xml does a much better job about this. The ant -p seems more userfriendly\nand its obvious what targets do what. For lucene its not.\n\nAlso solr/build.xml defines 'ant compile' (lucene's doesnt, it maps to compile-core, which\nthen behaves differently than solr for people used to typing it).\n\nBasically I think the best solution is to try to make these two build.xml's targets \nas consistent as possible.",
