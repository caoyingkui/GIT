JapaneseTokenizerFactory always set third parameter, which controls this behavior, to true to remove punctuation.\nI would like to have an option I can configure this behavior by fieldtype definition in schema.xml.",

            "content": "Hiraga-san, there are different views on how punctuation characters best are handled by tokenizers.  Punctuation characters generally don't convey much meaning useful for text search, so they are generally removed in Lucene. (A different point of view is that tokenizers shouldn't remove punctuations and that filters should do this.)\n\nThe ability to keep punctuation was left as an expert-feature in JapanseTokenizer and I think we can expose this as an expert feature in Solr as well.  Could you share some details on your use-case just so that I get a better idea of the background and importance of this?\n\n\n "

Of course, we will discard punctuation in many cases but some cases, especially short text, we want to preserve punctuation. Therefore, I want to have an option that I can control this behaviour.\n\nOhtani-san, thank you for your early reply and patch!  "
