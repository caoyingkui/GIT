In a few places I got a little confused as to why some tests/configs were removed instead of just replacing the existing config with a MergePolicyFactory config \u2013 but I'm guessing that's because an equivilent MergePolicyFactory based test already exists?\n\nThe one thing that jumped out at me is SolrIndexConfig.effectiveUseCompoundFileSetting.  Now that SolrIndexConfig.fixUseCFMergePolicyInitArg is removed, I think we can/should simplify/remove the (mutable) effectiveUseCompoundFileSetting and assocaited methods/hacks into a finel boolean useCompoundFile just like every other SOlrIndexConfig setting. right?\n\nHoping to commit this later this month ...\n\n+1\n\n\ndo we need to throw an exception if anyone still configures <mergePolicy> or is it fair to silently ignore it\nI think a warning might be a fair compromise, instead of an exception or silent ignoring.\n\npart 2: small incremental change (replace throwing-exception with log-warning)\n\n\nWhoa, whoa ... what? ... no, no no! ... -1!\n\n<mergePolicy> was deprecated (and stopped appearing in example configs) in 5.5! If someone has been upgrading Solr since then and never bothered to notice the WARN in their log file informing them that they should switch to <mergePolicyFactory>, there is no sane reason to assume they will notice a WARN in their 7.0 logs that it's being completely ignored.   Doing that is effectively the same as silently ignoring their config \u2013 which means the implicit default <mergePolicyFactory> will be used while they think they are using some very explicit <mergePolicy/> and beating their heads against the wall trying to understand why 7.0 is ignoring their \"maxMergedSegmentMB\" etc....\n\nA WARNing is appropriate when config option X is deprecated but still supported \u2013 but once X is no longer supported at all we should absolutely hard fail if people are still trying to configure X \u2013 so that so they know they need to change their config.
