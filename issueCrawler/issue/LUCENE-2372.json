    "description": "After LUCENE-2302 is merged to trunk with flex, we need to carry over all tokenizers and consumers of the TokenStreams to the new CharTermAttribute.\n\nWe should also think about adding a AttributeFactory that creates a subclass of CharTermAttributeImpl that returns collation keys in toBytesRef() accessor. CollationKeyFilter is then obsolete, instead you can simply convert every TokenStream to indexing only CollationKeys by changing the attribute implementation.",

Tests not yet changed.\n\nThe following things were additionally fixed:\n\n\tStandardAnalyzer was made final (backwards break, we forgot to made it final in the 3.0 TS finalization issue). This enabled me to subclass StopwordAnalyzerBase and remove heavy code duplication. The original code also contained a bug in the tokenStream method (no setReplaceInvalidAcronym) which was correctin reusableTokenStream. Now it is correct.\n\n\n\nI will post further patches for core.
