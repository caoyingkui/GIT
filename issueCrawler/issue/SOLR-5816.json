I see no evidence that you have attempted to do this.\n\nYour first support contact should be for the Wordpress plugin.  The next support contact should be for the PHP Solr Client that the Wordpress plugin uses.\n\nhttps://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-search-by-my-solr-server/\nhttp://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/\n\nFinally ... since you did not block access to your Solr server from the Internet, I was able to get into its admin UI and look at the Logging tab.  Here's the error message in the most recent log entry:\n\norg.apache.solr.common.SolrException: undefined field: \"post_content_str\"\n\nThe plugin is trying to query Solr using a field called post_content_str, but this field does not exist in your schema.  The solrconfig.xml and schema.xml look like they are unchanged from the example defaults.  The Wordpress plugin probably comes with new config and schema files, as well as instructions on installing them.  You haven't done that step.\n\nI see that you have a post on the support forum for the Wordpress plugin.  As of right now, that post is only seven hours old.  They are the ones that will be able to help you with this problem. "
