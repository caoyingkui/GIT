    "description": "We've had the same first page of the Ref Guide for a long time, and it's probably fine as far as it goes, but that isn't very far. It's effectively a wall of text. \n\nSince we've got the ability to work with an online presentation, and we have some tools available already in use (BootstrapJS, etc.), we can do some new things.\n\nI've got a couple ideas I was playing with a few months ago. I'll dust those off and attach some screenshots here + a patch or two. These will, of course, work for the PDF so I'll include something to show that too (it can also be snazzier).",

            "content": "Here's a few screenshots of what I had in mind. The \"NewLandingPageTop.png\", \"-Mid\" and \"-Bottom\" show most of what the new main page of the Ref Guide will look like. The meat of it is in the top, though, really.\n\n\n\tRemoved page title across the top and replaced it with a \"jumbotron\" - basically a bunch of pre-defined JS that comes with Bootstrap and makes a big box on the page.\n\t\n\t\tThe \"copy\" (the text) in the box needs a bit of work maybe?\n\t\tChange the link to download into a button (this goes to the mirror for the latest, but could be set to go to archives for the version of the Guide the person is happens to be on...I prefer the mirror, but am open to other ideas).\n\t\n\t\n\tSplit the wall of text into about 6 boxes, organizing the main section headings into higher-level groupings.\n\t\n\t\tLeft nav is still there for anyone who prefers to see the main sections in their natural hierarchical order.\n\t\tThese could use a bit of review also - totally open to the idea there could be better titles for the boxes, and I know we need better \"copy\" for each item in the box.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nIn the PDF, the jumbotron thing does not come into play because that's an HTML thing, but those boxes are still used. Since this comes after a 4-page table of contents, repeating the main headings doesn't seem to do a ton of service, really. The \"PDF-intro.png\" shows how this would look.\n\nAn extension of the idea behind this layout is that it could be extended to some (maybe most, or even all) of the pages that head up each main section as a better way to introduce the topics in those sections, but I'm not promising that as part of this issue.\n\nThoughts? Opinions? ",
