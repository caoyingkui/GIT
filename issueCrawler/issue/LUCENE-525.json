I would like to be able to download a blob, install it, set a few settings, preferably in a GUI, and be on the air with search enabled on my static web site.\n\nWhat I find on the Examples page is nothing like this.  It is a collection of stuff that leads me to believe that I'll have to become expert in all sorts of Lucene arcana before I can get to my goal.",
