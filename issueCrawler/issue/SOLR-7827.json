    "description": "Why not support BSON (we recently added SMILE).\n\nBSON and Smile are two distinct binary formats.  They are related in that they are both based on the logical format of JSON (i.e., key-value objects) but they are distinct in that they write incompatible binary formats (you can neither directly read Smile as BSON nor vice-versa.)  They also have different incompatible features (e.g., BSON defines a date type, while Smile does not as far as I can tell.)\n\nBSON is the binary serialization used by MongoDB for network transfer and disk serialization.  Smile is the binary JSON format used by the Jackson project.  I don't know why these two projects created different binary formats with such similar purposes.  One reason might be that the MongoDB project required dates for their particular application, whereas the JSON format lacks a date type, and adherance to the JSON format may have been the reason that the Smile format does not include a date type.",
