Ie, the == case is still 0 hits returned?\n\nMaybe move the entire while loop into the \"else\"?  And move\nnumIterOnHits into the else too.\n\nThe javadocs state that the returned scoreDocs will have length always\nequal to size, but that's only true if there were enough hits right?\nMaybe change it to \"at most size\"?
