    "description": "See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/ZooKeeper+Access+Control\n\nTo get zkCredientialsProvider you need to parse solr.xml, but since solr.xml now can live in ZK, we need to have a way to keep various ZK setup and credentials elsewhere. By default in SolrDispatchFilter we'll use a SolrZkClient which reads zk creds/acl from VM params only, which should be fine.\n\nAfter solr.xml is read from zookeeper, the properties from solr.xml are used instead. These will be the same as the initial VM param though, so since we need a way to discover these classes from VM params anyway, we can skip the solr.xml config for these and simplify.",
