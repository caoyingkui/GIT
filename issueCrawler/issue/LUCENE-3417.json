    "description": "Due to an off-by-one error, a subword placed at the end of a compound word will not get a token added to the token stream.\n\n\nFor example (from the unit test in the attached patch):\nDictionary: \n{\"ab\", \"cd\", \"ef\"}\nInput: \"abcdef\"\nCreated tokens: \n{\"abcdef\", \"ab\", \"cd\"}\nExpected tokens: \n{\"abcdef\", \"ab\", \"cd\", \"ef\"}\n\n\nAdditionally, it could produce tokens that were shorter than the minSubwordSize due to another off-by-one error. For example (again, from the attached patch):\n\n\nDictionary: \n{\"abc\", \"d\", \"efg\"}\nMinimum subword length: 2\nInput: \"abcdefg\"\nCreated tokens: \n{\"abcdef\", \"abc\", \"d\", \"efg\"}\nExpected tokens: \n{\"abcdef\", \"abc\", \"efg\"}",
