    "description": "LatLonPoint methods are calling *precise() methods such as rectCrossesPolyPrecise(). GeoPointMethods are calling *approx() methods such as rectCrossesPolyApprox().\n\nI don't understand why we have two versions of these methods, why one is approximate, why we would ever use that, etc.\n\nThese geo methods are extremely expensive: we can't afford two copies. For example, in the case of these polygon methods, they are still missing direct tests. We need to remove one copy of these. I propose to remove the approx ones.",
