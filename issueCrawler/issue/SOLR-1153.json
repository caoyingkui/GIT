Child2Entity is child of child1Entity.\n\nwhen we add deltaImportQuery on child2Entity. It is not executing deltaImportQuery during delta import.\nI found that below code(#503) in the DocBuilder class is restricting the deltaImportQuery from not being executed at the nested child entity level.\nfor (EntityProcessorWrapper child : epw.getChildren()) \n{\n              buildDocument(vr, doc,\n                  child.getEntity().isDocRoot() ? pk : null, child, false, ctx, entitiesToDestroy);\n            } "
