    "description": "After reviewing LUCENE-3494, i checked other queries and noticed that BlockJoinQuery currently throws UOE for getBoost and setBoost:\n\nthrow new UnsupportedOperationException(\"this query cannot support boosting; please use childQuery.setBoost instead\");\n\n\n\nI don't think we can safely do that in queries, because other parts of lucene rely upon this working... for example BQs rewrite when\nit has a single clause and erases itself.\n\nSo I think we should just pass down the boost to the inner weight.",
