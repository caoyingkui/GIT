    "description": "Spinoff from SOLR-4761\n\nSolr first opens a DirectoryReader from the directory, then later will pass this to IW openIfChanged.\n\nI noticed this when i was confused that mergedsegmentwarmer doesn't appear to work at first until after you've reopened...\n\nI'm not totally sure what the current behavior causes (does IW's pool reuse segments from this passed-in \"external\" reader, or is this causing some horrible doubling-up/inefficient stuff etc?). To some extent i think we should change it even if its actually performant: I think its confusing.\n\nI think ideally we'd change IndexReaderFactory's method to take writer instead of directory so that custom DirectoryReaders can still work.",

I'm not sure that changing the IndexReaderFactory's method will work with a read-only slave, but adding another method for NRT/replication masters that take a writer might work. "

            "content": "Here is a patch. All tests pass.\n\nA few notes:\n\n\tthe init respects the existing 'reopenReaders' in solrconfig.xml, so if you have that set to false, it still does the same thing as before.\n\tIndexReaderFactory gets a newReader(IndexWriter, ..) so that NRT users can still customize the DirectoryReader being used.\n\tA few tests relied upon the fact that init didnt open an indexwriter: MultiCoreExampleTestBase always created a core container and opened cores, so this was moved to the embedded subclass which needs it. The ReplicationHandler test and the TestArbitraryIndexDir just set reopenReaders=false because they rely fundamentally on this 'readonly' case.\n\n "

            "content": "+1 - I think this is a good way to solve this. It's minimally invasive given all the other current code and it allows you still lazy load the IW if you don't reopen readers.\n\nI've closely reviewed the patch and run the units tests - it all looks okay to me. "
