Additionally, flattened fields up the node hierarchy will prevent anything else from being collected.\n\nThis looks like a limitation/ bug to me, but changing it to support overlapping paths will change the current behavior (which is underspecified and ignored at the moment anyway: it silently omits certain field specifications).
