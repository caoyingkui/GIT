Your fix is indeed correct.  In case you haven't noticed, you can work around this issue for now by specifying spellcheck.collateExtendedResults=true, as the separate branch in SpellCheckResponse for extended results does not have the bug.  While I hope a committer will take this one up sometime soon for both 4.x and 3.x, I wouldn't classify this as \"Major\" in priority as there is a good workaround. "
