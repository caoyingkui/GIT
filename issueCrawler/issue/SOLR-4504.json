            "content": "The problem is that unlike a simple TrieField that uses FieldCacheRangeFilter (which knows about docs that have no value) CurrencyField needs to use a ValueSourceRangeFilter wrapped arround the CurrencyValueSource that computes the exchange rate.\n\nAttached patch fixes things by combining it with a FieldValueFilter and updates the existing range query test to include lots of docs with no field value.  This seemed to expose another bug in CurrencyValueSource where you could get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because the ord(doc) value of the currency for a doc w/o values would be negative, which i fixed with an short-circut delegating to amounts.exist(doc)\n\n(4.1 users, even those with docs missing the currency field, wouldn't ever get the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because in 4.1 the FieldCache.DocTermsIndex used \"0\" \u2013 instead of \"-1\" as it is returned by ord() now with the new DocValues APIs) "
