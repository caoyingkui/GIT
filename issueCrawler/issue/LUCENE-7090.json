            "content": "Patch. I ported a good deal of the tests. If they were testing anything particular about numeric types, i kept the legacy version too. Separately there is still some cleanup to be done on the tests: I didn't port 100% of them yet (esp. dodging SlowMultiWrapper at every turn).\n\nWe can followup with multi-valued in another issue, this is already big enough at once.
