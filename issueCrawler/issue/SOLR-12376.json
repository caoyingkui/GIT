    "description": "This issue introduces a new RequestHandler: TaggerRequestHandler, AKA the SolrTextTagger from the OpenSextant project https://github.com/OpenSextant/SolrTextTagger. It's used for named entity recognition (NER) of text past to it. It doesn't do any NLP (outside of Lucene text analysis) so it's said to be a \"naive tagger\", but it's definitely useful as-is and a more complete NER or ERD (entity recognition and disambiguation) system can be built with this as a key component. The SolrTextTagger has been used on queries for query-understanding, and it's been used on full-text, and it's been used on dictionaries that number tens of millions in size. Since it's small and has been used a bunch (including helping win an ERD competition and in Apache Stanbol), several people have asked me when or why isn't this in Solr yet. So here it is.\n\nTo use it, first you need a collection of documents that have a name-like field (short text) indexed with the ConcatenateFilter (LUCENE-8323) at the end. We call this the dictionary. Once that's in place, you simply post text to a TaggerRequestHandler and it returns the offset pairs into that text for matches in the dictionary along with the uniqueKey of the matching documents. It can also return other document data desired. That's the gist; I'll add more details on use to the Solr Reference Guide.",

            "content": "Patch:\n\n\tCopied into new package org.apache.solr.handler.tagger\n\tThe source headers are retained from OpenSextant.  NOTICE.txt updated with legal mumbo-jumbo.  BTW IntelliJ annoyingly replaced the headers with the ASF one when I copied the files between projects  so I manually updated each one.  It didn't seem to honor the copyright feature settings to not update existing copyrights, at least not in this scenario.  Ugh.\n\tRemoved the htmlOffsetAdjust option with supporting class & test.  I altered TaggerRequestHandler accordingly but made it possible via sub-class extension so that it could be added externally (though the change for this is a little clumsy).  I don't want to add additional dependencies (Jericho HTML Parser, ASLv2 licensed), at least not at this time.  And in retrospect I've wondered if the underlying feature here could be accomplished in a better way.\n\t\n\t\tNote that the xmlOffsetAdjust expressly depends on Woodstox, which is already included with Solr.\n\t\n\t\n\tRemoved @author tags\n\tCopied the test config into test collection1 as solrconfig-tagger.xml and schema-tagger.xml\n\t\n\t\tReplaced the OpenSextant fully qualified package name of the handler with \"solr.TaggerRequestHandler\".\n\t\t\n\t\t\tmodified SolrResourceLoader.packages to include \"handler.tagger.\" due to the sub-package\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tReplaced the OpenSextant package name of the ConcatenateFilter to \"solr.ConcatenateFilter\" which now works.  (we depend on LUCENE-8323)\n\t\tMerged the TaggingAttribute test config into this config since it was easy to do and avoids bloating with yet another config\n\t\n\t\n\tRemoved legacy support of configuration which allowed top level settings in the request handler as implied invariants.\n\n\n\nTODO docs ",

CGFF supports synonyms and other filters producing stacked tokens at indexing time. This is very\u00a0useful for the tagger!\n\n\tI added a test for this \u2013 testWDF to test that WordDelimiterGraphFilter works with catenation options.\n\tpartial tagging (via shingling) is no longer easily supported so I commented this out. It has to do with difficulties in configuring the separator char (CGFF doesn't have this configurable). This feature is probably dubious any way.\n\n\n\nAdded docs, which was an amalgamation of the SolrTextTagger's\u00a0existing README and QUICK_START\u00a0files\u00a0hand-edited/massaged some. I verified the tutorial instructions. I added a bin/post version of sending the CSV. \u00a0That was a bit of a pain to figure out.\n\nAt this point it's ready but pending LUCENE-8332. \u00a0 ",
