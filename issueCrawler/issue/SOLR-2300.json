    "description": "Hi,\n\nWe are using Solr on Mac OSX and it is working fine.  Same setup we have moved to Linux.  We have master, slave setup. Every 5 minutes, index will be replicated from Master to Slave and will be installed on slave.  But on Linux on the slave when the snapinstaller script is called, it is failing and showing below error in logs.\n\n/bin/rm: cannot remove `/ngs/app/esearcht/Slave2index/data/index/.nfs000000000001110300000749': Device or resource busy\n\nThis error is occuring in snapinstaller script at below lines.\n  cp -lr ${name}/ ${data_dir}/index.tmp$$ && \\\n  /bin/rm -rf ${data_dir}/index && \\\n  mv -f ${data_dir}/index.tmp$$ ${data_dir}/index\n\nIt is not able to remove the index folder. So the index.tmp files are keep growing in the data directory.\n\nOur data directory is \"/ngs/app/esearcht/Slave2index/data\".  When  checked with ls -al in the index directory, there are some .nfs files still there, which are not letting index directory to be deleted.  And these .nfs files are still being used by SOLR in jboss.\n\nThis setup is giving issue only in linux.  Is this known bug on linux?",

Is this known bug on linux?\n\nI think the deletion problem is a combination of using nfs and solr (or some other process) holding some file open.\n\nI realize this issue is pretty old but have you tried with more recent version of Solr, does the problem still exist?
