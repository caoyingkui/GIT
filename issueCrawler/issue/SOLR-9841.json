(see SOLR-5783 and TestIndexSearcher.testReopen)\n\n\n...there is no value add in a new option to prevent the commit from being fired \u2013 it won't do anything unless there is something to commit.\n\nIf DocExpirationUpdateProcessorFactory users want commits to happen less frequently, then they can change the autoDeletePeriodSeconds to be less frequent, because by definition there is no utility in a low autoDeletePeriodSeconds value unless searchers are being re-opened with the same frequency.\n\n\n\nmaybe this... is a Jira issue? Pretty unclear, having the menu item titled \"Create Service Desk Request\" when you're told to create a Jira issue...\n\nsigh.  yes you did in fact create a jira issue \u2013 aparently jira was upgraded recently and the term \"Issue\" doesn't seem to exist anymore, they appear to have been renamed into \"Service Desk Request\" ... i don't know why.

In many cases it's probably good enough to let the next autocommit take care of opening a new searcher and rendering the docs un-findable rather than forcing the commit from the code.

The problem is that we're opening multiple searchers in rapid succession apparently due to autocommit expiry coupled with this commit. Hmmmm, maybe I'm jumping the gun here and the real question is whether the commit from the code resets the autocommit expiry? I admit I haven't tracked that bit down. \n\nI suppose another sequence could be:\n\n\tautocommit expires and starts warming a new searcher\n\tTTL kicks in, deletes some docs and does the commit while the searcher from <1> is still warming producing the warning.\n\n\n\nAll that said, this doesn't seem like a major problem more a tidying-up.\n\nHmmm, when I hover over the \"Create\" button the tooltip is \"create a new issue/bug/feature request\", but the drop down is, indeed, Create Service Desk Request\".

And - mea culpa - I actually enabled Service Desk for Solr to see whether the reporting abilities it had would be useful for \"dead issues\" tracking. I did not realize it would then show big red numbers everywhere as well. I've disabled that for Solr just now, but this still does not fix the 'Add Service Request' issue, which IIRC was already there before. So, if this needs to be escalated, it should probably go into Infra hands (and separate issue).  ",
