            "content": "WHOA! I got all confused between Isabelle's original comment and Cassandra's, Isabelle uses ZkCLI and Cassandra uses bin/solr.\n\nI think the problem may be common to both, but my comments below are about the bin/solr version.\n\nI think I see the problem and that this particular issue should be fixed, i.e. empty znodes with no children should be files locally rather than directories.\n\nI don't think I want to try anything fancier. If a user copies down from ZK and the ZK state changes (i.e. a node with data gets children etc.) then erroring out and recommending that they use a clean local directory seems reasonable.\n\nThe rest of this is details you can read through if you want to or wonder what the heck the second point means.\n\nI think the problem is in ZkMaintenanceUtils.downloadFromZk. This code\n\n   if (children.size() == 0) {\n        // If we didn't copy data down, then we also didn't create the file. But we still need a marker on the local\n        // disk so create a dir.\n        if (copyDataDown(zkClient, zkPath, file.toFile()) == 0) {\n          Files.createDirectories(file);\n        }\n\n\n\ncopyDataDown returns, well, zero if there's no data in the znode. I changed this code a while back because recursive copy wasn't working correctly (SOLR-10108) and I suspect it was introduced then. And it went in Solr 6.6 so it fits Isabelle's testing, including the bit about putting a comment in the stopwords.txt makes it a file rather than a directory..\n\nzNodes can have both data and children. The logic says, in effect, \"if the znode has no data and no children it'll be mapped into an empty directory\". There's logic in there that if a znode has both data and children, it's made into a directory with a special file containing its data (zknode.data).\n\nThe simple fix would be just to decide the other way, i.e. a znode with no data and no children would become an empty file locally rather than a directory. That actually seems OK since I don't think ZK cares. \n\nThe more I think about this the more I think the correct behavior is the easy fix above. ZK doesn't care; a znode can have data added and children added at will so if we make the local node an empty text file it'd be copied back up as a znode just like any other, albeit one without data or children, but that's OK as far as ZK is concerned. That doesn't preclude someone adding children to the ZK node after pushing it back up via another mechanism.\n\nThere'll still be an edge case where \n\n\tsomeone copies an empty znode from ZK and it becomes a file\n\tthe ZK node gets children\n\tthe person tries the copy again from ZK to local\n\n\n\nSince the copy down now already has a text file for that znode and then tries to make a directory there it'll probably error out. At least it better. I think we can live with that, it would be a good thing to add a test though.\n\nI'm torn about whether to try to \"do the right thing\" in the case above. First, it appears to much of an edge case. One could write something like:\nif (the local file is zero length) {\n  remove the file\n  create a directory in it's place\n}\n\nWhich seems relatively safe. Except.... that doesn't handle the case where \n\n\ta znode exists with data\n\tdownconfig copies it locally as a text file\n\tthe znode gets children through some other mechanism\n\tdownconfig is run again\n\n\n\nIn that case \"the right thing\" would be to move the data to the zknode.data and make the local node into a directory and continue. Probably could do this \"en passant\" by just deleting the text file and continuing, the directory would be add it in its place and children would be added. Deleting data on the local disk makes me nervous though.\n\nI'll assign it to myself, if anyone else wants to take it feel free. ",

Not unusual.\n\nAnyway, I tested with bin/solr, zkcli.sh and ZkCLI (mac) but I can't test it on Windows. Isabelle, if you're feeling brave could you download the patch, compile and give it a whirl and let me know?\n\nBTW, the start scripts may be easier to use, try \"bin/solr.cmd zk -help\". The upconfig/downconfig are modeled closely on the ZkCLI, but don't require all the classpath etc. \n\nI have yet to precommit and run all the tests, but certainly all the tests in SolrCLIZkUtilsTest run successfully.
