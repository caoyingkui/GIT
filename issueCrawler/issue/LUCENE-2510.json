This is a good step to use real library versions instead of Version for backwards compat.\n\tanalyzers modules such as smartcn and icu, that aren't currently available to solr users due to large file sizes or dependencies, would be simple optional plugins to solr and easily available to users that want them.\n\n\n\nRough sketch in this thread: http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/3465a0e55ba94d58/solr_and_analyzers_module\n\nPractically, I havent looked much and don't really have a plan for how this will work yet, so ideas are very welcome.",

My suggestion for this is to migrate Solr's ResourceLoader interface, and maybe provide simple FileResourceLoader and ClassPathResourceLoaders that Lucene users can use. ",

Solr's just builds CharArraySet/Map up front.\n\tthe Solr file loading code has some features like trying to guess the size of the set/map up front for faster loading.\n\tthe Solr stopword loading code is more user-friendly as it ignores BOM markers etc.\n\n\n\nI think it would be good to only have one piece of code for this functionality and for it to be optimal.

This will make the properties that a Factory has a great deal clearer as it won't be necessary to initialize the Factory using a Map.  It'll also increase their testability.  Part of this will require changing how Solr initializes the Factories from its XML configuration.  The simplist way is to change the attribute names in the configuration to match the bean property.\n\n\n\n\n\tEither move the ResourceLoader interface to Lucene, or do some fancy property injection just in Solr and remove ResourceLoading from factories.  The former option means Lucene, Solr and any future modules can all use a single consist interface for resource loading.  But it may also introduce something which isn't Lucene's responsibility.  The latter would involve the factories having List<String> properties for example, and Solr detecting this and injecting the list from its own ResourceLoader.  It introduces more complexity into Solr, but presents a very clean interface in the Factory which increases its readability, testability, and makes them more programmatically friendly.\n\n ",

            "content": "re: what is the purpose of the newInstance method?\n\n\nIf you take a look at org.apache.solr.analysis.DelimitedPayloadTokenFilterFactory you'll see an example of how it's used.\n\nLooking at the implementation in SolrResourceLoader, it seems to facilitate two things:\n\nThe use of simplified solr.* package names\nIn FSTSynonymFilterFactory for example, newInstance is used to load other components. Consequently bq. bq. SolrResourceLoader adds the instantiated classes to its tracking of SolrCoreAware, ResourceLoaderAware, bq. etc.\nWith all that said, its only used in 3 Factories (but a lot of other Solr code). Perhaps we can break it bq. out somehow.\n\nI think we should revisit this. I don't like placing this into the analyzers module when not many factories actually use it, instead a lot of unrelated code in solr actually uses it. I think this could cause a mess.\n\nOn the other hand, both the things this provides can be achieved in other ways. For example, if we use NamedSPILoader instead to allow components such as factories to be found by name, then we can support \"solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory\" because TokenizerFactory.forName(\"WhitespaceTokenizerFactory\") works. Using the SPI mechanism would allow for us to have completely pluggable analysis modules, also operations like listAll() work in case you want to enumerate a list (imagine someone that doesnt want a xml configuration but configured by a GUI or something like that instead). We also keep sane packaging within the analysis modules and keep type safety, and solr still keeps its solr.XXX syntax without reflecting a zillion packages or other crazy things.\n\n\n ",

How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName?\n\nIt needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!), but it works like Charset.forName(\"ASCII\") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName, Codec.listAllCodecs, ...).\n\nHave a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you \"register\" your classes in\nyour jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.\n\nSo this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(\"Whitespace\") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily, they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars), are automatically available this way.\n\nI think Uwe mentioned this idea before, though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue \n\nJust something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit...  ",

If PayloadEncoder really needs to be\npluggable by class then you always also put it under SPI too (PayloadEncoder.forName).\n\nIn general if we decide on the SPI approach, I think it would be useful to think of improving the solr config too,\nbecause the current configuration is so verbose and redundant.\ne.g. for backwards compat we could support:\n\n\n<charFilter class=\"solr.HtmlStripCharFilterFactory\"/>\n<tokenizer class=\"solr.StandardTokenizerFactory\"/>\n<filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n<filter class=\"solr.PorterStemFilterFactory\"/>\n\n\n\nbut going forward this would be cleaner IMO, just use the SPI name directly:\n\n\n<charFilter name=\"HtmlStrip\"/>\n<tokenizer name=\"Standard\"/>\n<filter name=\"LowerCase\"/>\n<filter name=\"PorterStem\"/>\n\n ",
