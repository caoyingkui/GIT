    "description": "I believe it would add value to the Currency field type if you could specify the default precision/number of fractional digits for the currency field type.  Using the currency.getDefaultFractionDigits() at present limits the type of currency information that can be stored.  \n\nFor instance if you would like to store values exclusive of local tax and then perform a tax calculation in the client application prior to presenting the value to the end user, the default number of fractional digits is often not enough to provide the required accuracy in this calculation.",
