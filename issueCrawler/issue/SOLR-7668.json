    "description": "I was setting up some rule-based collections, and I hit an NPE whenever I try to include a port-based rule. It looks like the implementation was started, but not completed for ports. Patch coming in just a moment.\n\nI included a test, and I have no problems getting the test to pass when run by itself. However, when I run it w/ the other tests in RulesTest, it fails because of some ZK errors, but I often have those issues when running any of the distrib tests.",
