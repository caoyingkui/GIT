I think a solid orange circle would make a good Sun/\"o\", and in the context of the other letters would be an obvious character ... it could then have a radiating gradient or light orange to yellow ... it seems like that owuld be a good balance between the two designs posted so far.\n\none other personal opinion: with teh crescnet, the \"r\" looks okay, but without it, we probably want to narrow it a bit \u2013 it sticks way out there.\n\nAs for a logo for \"Flare\" ... i think resusing the current \"Solr on fire\" logo might be perfect  "

I like the rounded corners, although they disappear at smaller sizes.  (Use half-circles for all ends?)\n\nLogo must include \"Apache\".  Added as white text inside the S.

It should be possible to scale the logo, or a salient part of it, as small as a favicon (16x16) and still have it easily recognized.  Most of the designs above require a lot of pixels to be recognizable.  A good logo should be iconic more than textual--an abstract symbol.\n\nOften you can sample an element of a logo to form a favicon (like we do with Lucene's 'L').  So, when voting, think about whether there's an easily identifiable sample (e.g., is the typeface of the 'S' distinctive?).\n\nI note that Steve Stedman did not provide his logos under the Apache license.

(they would have only one entry in that \"family\" to earn votes)\n\nWe should stick to the voting as established.  Fortunately the two separate votes (first by the community and then a binding vote by committers) gives committers the flexibility for take into account the total scores for a \"family\" of designs before casting final votes.\n\nAlso: just because the deadline for submitting new designs is in ~8 hours, doesn't mean we have to hold the vote immediately \u2013 we can give people time to discuss each of the \"families\" and which one is the strongest candidate from each and let the creator retract any less popular variations before holding the vote.
