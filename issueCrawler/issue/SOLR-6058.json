How should those be selected or contributed?\n\nIn one way the web page must be true to the non-commercial, neutral nature of being an Apache project. But on the other side our users are commercial and after having been \"sold\" on the nice web site and having tried Solr themselves, the next thing they look for on the site is \"Anyone I trust using it?\" and then \"Where can I find books, consulting, training and support?\".\n\nToday we expose some books, but list of users is well hidden in https://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers and Solr professionals also hide quite well in the oddly named wiki page https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Support - not very well maintained nor beautiful pages and horribly difficult to find.\n\nCould we fix this on the new home page e.g. with some sub-items under the \"Community\" dropdown menu? Instead of a boring outdated bullet list, we could have list of  \"info cards\", each one presenting a success-story or consulting firm based on some predefined content items and size-limit. Then perhaps the logo of 5 random users from that list could be presented on the front-page? Is this accepted by Apache rules? How to maintain?\n "

            "content": "In thinking through the impetus behind creating a new website, it became clear that it was a good time to put some effort behind the Solr identity system as well.\n\nI certainly believe that the content of the website needs to be thoughtfully considered, but I felt that I could best contribute an identity system and templates such that the community could use them as a toolset and visual framework for building the new site.\n\nAdditionally, a new identity system will help me and other designers in the Solr community create cohesive graphics for other things as well, such as t-shirts, meetup resources, and the like.\n\nI am hopeful that a beautiful new website and identity will help revitalize the outward-facing brand of Solr and help bolster its position in the market and the search community.\n\n\n\nManifest:\n\n\n\tSolr_Styleguide.pdf - This is the primary general-use guide for the new identity system.\n\tSolr_Icons.pdf - This is an editable PDF of the vector source images for the new Solr icon set, and could serve as the main source file for the icon library.\n\tSOLR-6058 - This is the diff of the website. It's a huge patchfile. It applies to the lucene TLP website (http://lucene.apache.org/site-instructions.html). Included in the diff are SVG exports of the icons that are used on the website, but can also be used anywhere else they make sense. (You can see a preview of this patch here.)\n\tSolr_Logo_on* - These are editable PDF (vector) and high-resolution PNG (raster) versions of the logo for use everywhere. If you're applying it to a white or light background, use _on_white. If you're applying to a dark background, use _on_black. The _on_orange variant is specifically intended for use on a field of the orange specified in the styleguide.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few notes:\n\n\n\tThese files are Adobe Illustrator editable PDFs. This means that if you have a PDF viewer, you can view the assets, but they are preserved as editable documents as well, so that we don't need to maintain separate AI files.\n\tGetting the Apache CMS to build is not necessarily the most straightforward thing. If you'd like to, start here and here. These docs are a little out of date, and I'd like to say I'm going to submit a patch to them as well, but we'll see how this goes. If you'd just like to view the new site, I have the patch installed and running on my server here: http://lucene.lukesh.com/solr\n\tThere are a few major page types (not necessarily \"templates\" in the Apache CMS sense of the word, but more like boilerplate examples):\n\t\n\t\thttp://lucene.lukesh.com/solr/ - Clearly a homepage / landing page layout, with example of the \"content bar\" visuals going down the page.\n\t\thttp://lucene.lukesh.com/solr/news.html - A basic content page. This is an example of how it can easily be used for the News section.\n\t\thttp://lucene.lukesh.com/solr/features.html - This showcases some more layout options.\n\t\thttp://lucene.lukesh.com/solr/resources.html - This showcases a 2nd-tier navigation bar that can anchor to the top of the page when a user scrolls down.\n\t\thttp://lucene.lukesh.com/solr/tutorials.html - This is another way to create a secondary navigation bar. This also allows for very deep content.\n\t\n\t\n\n "

I don't think the tabs fit with the new design, but at the same time, it would be good to somehow make it clear how to get back.\n\nAlso, I uploaded some logos from the Solr Public Servers page.

I included AngularJS in order to provide a relatively prescriptive framework on which to build interactive features (vs. an ad-hoc JavaScript methodology), and I had included the $location dependency with automatically adds slashes to named anchors like that in order to manage the location history and path for interactive applications. This is good for pages where the interactivity needs to modify the URL and reconstitute state when linked, but we don't have anything like that in the site at this point. After removing the $location dependency, the named anchors worked as expected. SOLR-6058.location-fix.patchfile "

Solr is already extremely popular and well known, but by putting it in Pluralsight it can reach people that were not aware that it even exists and shows the wonders that can be done quickly on search using Solr.\n\nIt takes a total newbie and gets their feet wet in the Solr world very quickly and presents SolrNet as a great way to create an application on top of it. I've received pretty good feedback from multiple people on how it helped them get started and have even delivered it in person in front of up to 30 people. Now I am also working on a non commercial/free book with the same purpose.\n\nI would like to add it as a resource to help users ramp up quickly as a suggestion: SOLR-6748 \n\nIs it possible to add it?
