I will review the patch tomorrow, but I think pSDP needs to have a getIC(gen) because if the apps persists the gens, it needs a way to obtain their IC instance.\n\nI think separately we should fix PersistentSDP to store its state in a single file ... separate issue.\n\n+1! would be great if this can be in the index directory, so that app doesn't need to make up locations. but let's discuss that separately.

They should be equivalent, only assertSame produces nicer error message.\n\t\n\t\tSame for assertTrue(s1 == s2); // should be the same instance\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSDP.snapshot javadoc:\n\t\n\t\t\"using the same ID parameter\"; I guess it's a copy-paste error from the previous SDP version?\n\t\tIllegalStateException still refers to ID\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\treleaseGen: can we relax it to not fail if someone calls release on an unsnpshotted gen? I guess someone can workaround that by calling sdp.getIC(gen) and if not null call release. But I think it's not necessarily an error to release an unsnapshotted gen, e.g. code which releases from different places. No strong feelings about it though, so it's your call.\n\n\n\n\n\tPersistent \u2013 do you want to change SNAPSHOT_ID to SNAPSHOT_GENS?\n\n ",
