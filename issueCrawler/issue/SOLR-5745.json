    "description": "In order to avoid \"Overlapping onDeckSearchers=2\" warnings, we'd like to set maxWarmingSearchers=1 in solrconfig.xml. If we do that, though, and happen to request a hard commit while an automatic soft commit is already processing, we get an error like this:\n\n\nError opening new searcher. exceeded limit of maxWarmingSearchers=1, try again later.\n\n\n\nand the request fails.\n\nWhat we'd like to see is for UpdateRequest to support a parameter, similar to the existing waitSearcher parameter, that instructs the server to hold the request until no other searchers were currently warming. (Or, more precisely, until the request could proceed without exceeding maxWarmingSearchers.)\n\nIt seems something like this could eliminate the performance penalty of having multiple on-deck searchers without the unpredictable errors caused by setting maxWarmingSearchers=1. The performance penalty moves to a place that expects it: the code that requested a commit and said it was willing to wait.",
