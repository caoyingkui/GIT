    "description": "AFAICT, the simple string syntax of JSON Facet Modules \"statistic facets\" (ex: foo:\"min(fieldA)\" ) means there is no way to request a statistic with a domain change applied \u2013 stats are always computed relative to it's immediate parent (ie: the baseset matching the q for a top level stat, or the constrained set if a stat is a subfacet of something else)\n\nThis means that things like the simple \"fq exclusion\" in StatsComponent have no straight forward equivalent in JSON faceting. \n\nThe work around appears to be to use a type:\"query\", q:\":, domain:... parent and specify the stats you are interested in as sub-facets...\n\n\n$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/query' -d 'q=*:*&omitHeader=true&fq={!tag=boo}id:hoss&stats=true&stats.field={!max=true ex=boo}popularity&rows=0&json.facet={\nbar: { type:\"query\", q:\"*:*\", domain:{excludeTags:boo}, facet: { foo:\"max(popularity)\" } } }'\n{\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":0,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[]\n  },\n  \"facets\":{\n    \"count\":0,\n    \"bar\":{\n      \"count\":32,\n      \"foo\":10}},\n  \"stats\":{\n    \"stats_fields\":{\n      \"popularity\":{\n        \"max\":10.0}}}}",

You'd have to either specify the domain redundently (or i imagine it would be more efficient to put the domain on a type:query, query:\"*:*\" and nest all the term facets & functions under that?)\n\n\n\nFWIW: one thing I realize now that hadn't occured to me when i opened this issue is that customizing the domain on the stat would complicate \u2013 and probably make it impossible to \u2013 sorting the parent facet buckets by the stat.
