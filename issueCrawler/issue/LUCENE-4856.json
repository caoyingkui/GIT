Return null?\n\nIt returns null ... I'll add a test.\n\nWhat score does the passage get?\n\nI currently leave it at 0 ... maybe we should do NaN?  This would give\nthe formatter a way to detect the \"missing highlights\"?\n\nIf we change the default, some docs need changing: e.g. \"If no highlights were found for a document, its value is <code>null</code>\"\n\nOK, I'll add a nocommit so I don't forget this ...\n\nIn the main loop, this if check could then go? Or maybe this is the place to do this instead?\n\nI'll move it up.  I'm not sure the if check can go ... does\nBreakIterator ever return nothing?\n\nI think this would be extremely confusing with multiple fields...\n\nHmmm, true.  An app might highlight N fields and then would want to\nsee null on some of those fields so that it knows to use the other\nfield's highlights.\n\nBut I think the more common case is highlighting a big field (eg the\n\"body\" field)?  I would lean towards defaulting this on, and adding\nsetter / or you subclass and override getEmptyHighlight to turn it\non.  Hmmm maybe getEmptyHighlight should take the field name... ",
