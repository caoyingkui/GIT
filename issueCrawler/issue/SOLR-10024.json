            "content": "This tries to use the current working directory to find the src, but when using ant that can be moved around (one use is for parallel tests). In this case, tests.workDir may not fall under the src tree, and null will be returned.\n\nThis patch improves on this by passing a new system property with the ant current working directory and determineSourceHome will first look for that system property, else do what is has been doing.
