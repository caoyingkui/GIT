I can take a crack at it.\n\nThe split itself will be retried by the Overseer Collection Processor again but the test does not take that into account.\n\nIt seems like the this is not just a test problem then - it's the call to submit the cmd through the collections api that returns a failure - if the overseer is going to retry, I don't think that command should return a fail. It should probably wait until the split is done (taking into account retries) and then return the result when it actually knows it. Otherwise it claims the call failed, but it may succeed on the retry.\n\n "
