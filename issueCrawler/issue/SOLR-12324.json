I'm just afraid that it's twice bigger than the parent \"enabler\" feature. \nDistributed case should be covered for sure, however it should be nobrainer since FacetLongMerger or so takes care about it since blocks don't span across shards.\nAlso, what would be the best place to extract BitProducer caching?
