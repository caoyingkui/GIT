This regex is now generated from the two latest releases.\n\t<code> -> <code><pre> (to make them look better in HTML) is now blocked for inline usages, so that newlines are not added to the HTML version when they are not present in CHANGES.txt.\n\tImbalanced parentheses were incorrectly recognized as attribution onset.\n\n ",
