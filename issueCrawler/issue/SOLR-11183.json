Should this be a blocker and should we hold up the release",

Assuming that's the case, I don't think we need to hold up 7.0 for this. ",

I find 44 occurrences of /v2 and 20 occurrences of ____v2 in the code base, including comments and docs. ",

Attaching a patch that points /api to /solr/___v2 (i.e. earlier only /v2 pointed to /solr/___v2, now both do so); please review. Although I think this is a minimal risk change (but very important to get in now), I leave it to Anshum Gupta's judgement, though, for inclusion in 7.0. ",
