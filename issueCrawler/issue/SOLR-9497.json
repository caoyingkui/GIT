The CloseableHttpClient class was introduced in HttpClient 4.3.  As of 6.2.0, SolrJ's source code uses both SystemDefaultHttpClient and CloseableHttpClient.  SystemDefaultHttpClient is a derivative class descending from CloseableHttpClient, and SolrJ 6.2.0 uses this inheritance when passing objects.\n\nMy best guess (which I admit could be wrong) is that you've got HttpClient 4.2.x jars on your classpath, either as a version-specific dependency from something else in your POM, or from jars being loaded when your application starts.  HttpClient 4.2 will not know about CloseableHttpClient, and probably would result in the error you are seeing.\n\nUsing a Builder call just like yours, with a project classpath that includes SolrJ 6.2.0 and is known to be clean, I have no issues. Based on what I have seen so far, this is NOT a Solr problem.  It is a problem with your specific development or execution environment.\n\nAs Erick already mentioned, this question belongs on the solr-user mailing list, or in the #solr IRC channel.  It does not belong in Jira until the problem has been investigated and determined to be a bug.\n\nIf you want to continue discussing this beyond this reply, please take the discussion to the mailng list or IRC channel.
