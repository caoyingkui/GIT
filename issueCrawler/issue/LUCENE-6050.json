            "content": "Hello jane chang .\nThank you very much for the patch,\nThe initial description of this issue was rather confusing, so I have updated it.\n\nI have checked the patch and your implementation is \n\nlookup(CharSequence key, Set<BytesRef> contexts, int num, boolean allTermsRequired, boolean doHighlight, boolean allContextsRequired)\n\n which was accidentally mentioned in the initial issue description. \n\nIn term of flexibility, there are many ways to solve this issue and we could have something like:\n\nlookup(CharSequence key, Set<BytesRef> contexts, Set<BytesRef> requiredContexts, int num, boolean allTermsRequired, boolean doHighlight)\n \nor \n\nlookup(CharSequence key, Map<BytesRef, BooleanClause.Occur> contextInfo, int num, boolean allTermsRequired, boolean doHighlight)\n\nor\n\nlookup(CharSequence key, Map<BooleanClause.Occur, Set<BytesRef>> contextInfo, int num, boolean allTermsRequired, boolean doHighlight)\n\nor ...?\nWhat do you think jane chang and Michael McCandless would be the cleanest and most flexible way to do this?\n\nThanks.
