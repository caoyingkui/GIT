    "description": "When using a custom search component in Solr I noticed that the order of the \"params\", \"response\" and \"facet_counts\" fields in the response changed. Normally the \"response\" field is included before the \"facet_counts\" field, but in my result it first returned \"facet_counts\" and then \"response\". This is of course a valid and semantically identical result object, but it causes SolrJ to fail with a NullPointerException.\n\nThe reason for this NPE is that SolrJ in org.apache.solr.client.solrj.response.QueryResponse.setResponse(NamedList<Object> res) uses a loop through the response components and right after encountering \"facet_counts\" calls extractFacetInfo( _facetInfo ). That method uses _results which is null if the \"response\" component has not been encountered yet. (It is handled and set a few lines above the call to extractFacetInfo).\n\nThe solution is to move the call to extractFacetInfo() on line 99 out of the for-loop. Please see the attached simple patch for the solution.\n\nI have also checked the three other initialization calls that are made directly after encountering a result (extractDebugInfo, extractHighlightingInfo and extractSpellCheckInfo), the problem does not apply to those because the methods don't access global fields that need to be initialized.\n\nNote: It would be great if this could be applied to a maintenance release as it saves people from running a custom build to be able to use complex search components with SolrJ.",
