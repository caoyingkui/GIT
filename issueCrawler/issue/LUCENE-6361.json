(N = number of states in the incoming automaton), albeit with a tiny constant in front of the N since bitsets can scan very quickly...\n\nSo then the loop becomes O(N^2) when it's O(N) now?\n\nI realize the automata we see in this method are supposed to be very small (graph expansions of one suggestion after analysis) but still...

On the other hand this patch avoids object allocations of list entry objects which may compensate it (I don't know the complexity of object allocations / garbage collection). If you still think, this patch is not good, I am not sad if you reject it  "
