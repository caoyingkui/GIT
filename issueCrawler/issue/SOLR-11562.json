    "description": "The commit in SOLR-10272 added logging of solr.default.condfir to SolrDispatchFilter, breaking the ASCII-art Solr logo on most Terminal window widths  Example:\n\nINFO  (main) [   ] o.e.j.s.Server jetty-9.3.20.v20170531\nINFO  (main) [   ] o.a.s.s.SolrDispatchFilter  ___      _       Welcome to Apache Solr\u2122 version 7.1.0\nINFO  (main) [   ] o.a.s.s.SolrDispatchFilter / __| ___| |_ _   Starting in standalone mode on port 8983\nINFO  (main) [   ] o.a.s.s.SolrDispatchFilter \\__ \\/ _ \\ | '_|  Install dir: /t/solr-7.1.0, Default config dir: /t/solr-7.1.0/server/solr/configsets/_default/conf\nINFO  (main) [   ] o.a.s.s.SolrDispatchFilter |___/\\___/_|_|    Start time: 2017-10-27T20:32:47.832Z\nINFO  (main) [   ] o.a.s.c.SolrResourceLoader Using system property solr.solr.home: /t/solr-7.1.0/server/solr\n\n\n\nI propose to simply remove that logging change. My vision for the reduction of logging was to drop all the noise and only show essential info on every startup, info that will aid in debugging and troubleshooting. We already show what config set is being used when the user creates the collection.\n\nSo I'll go ahead and commit a removal of this for 7.2. Ping Ishan Chattopadhyaya",
