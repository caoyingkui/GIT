    "description": "Hi, I have been experimenting with the new heatmap facet in solr 5. When I use grid level 6 I notice a bug.\n\nwith level 7, I get for example\nrows: 6\ncols: 26\nXmaX: 10.7514953613 Xmin 10.7157897949\nYmaX: 59.9317932129 Ymin 59.9235534668\nCell size\n0.00137329101562 x 0.00137329101562\n\nwith level 6\nrows: 11\ncols: 26\nX maX: 10.8435058594 Xmin 10.5578613281\nY maX: 59.9468994141 Ymin 59.8864746094\nCell size\n0.010986328125 x 0.0054931640625\n\nnotice the cell size \nI could be that my code is faulty, but this works for all other grid levels",

            "content": "I was especially looking for the field type.  You didn't quite articulate what the problem was, but I'm figuring your expectation is that the cell size is square (in degrees units, any way).  Based on whatever your field type is configured to be, the cells are apparently square for level 7 but not for level 6.  I strongly suspect you are using a geohash tree. Geohash cells are rectangles that alternate in orientation at each level.  If you set facet.heatmap.gridLevel=8 then I bet it would not be square, but if you did at facet.heatmap.gridLevel=5 then it would be square.  If you want square grid cells, use a quad tree, set geo=false, and set the worldBounds to ENVELOPE(-180, 180, 180, -180).  When I get some time to finish up the new \"flex\" tree, it'll be square by default and you could choose 16 or 64 cells, in addition to the 4 option. ",
