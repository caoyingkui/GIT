    "description": "A multistat() facet function could calculate a bunch of statistics together, rather than having to specify each individually.  This would presumably be more efficient to calculate and shorter to specify.\n\nnumber_of_values, min, max, sum, sum_of_squares, variance, stddev\n\nWe would also want to be able to use any of these for sorting or filtering... perhaps with a dot notation.  That could be a separate issue to implement, but we should keep it in mind.\n\n\ntype: terms,\nfield: myfield,\nsort : \"x.max desc\"\nfacet: {\n  x : \"multistat(numeric_field)\"\n}",
