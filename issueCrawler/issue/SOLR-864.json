Even though DataImportHandler does not commit documents in such case, in the absence of an entry in the log, it becomes very difficult to track down the cause.\n\nLook at http://markmail.org/message/mhqae66p262d5mcc for discussion on solr-user.\n\nDataImportHandler should catch Throwable and log all errors/exceptions.",
