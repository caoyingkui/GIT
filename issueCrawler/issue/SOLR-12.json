    "description": "Even though Solr supports POSTing queries now, here are some situations in which SolrServletRequest.getParamString() generates an NPE only when the the query is a POST.\n\nthis seems to be an issue because of the way Jetty's HttpServletRequest.getParameterMap() treats empty query args differentely depending on wether the request was a GET or a POST \u2013 but i'm not sure how other containers will behave, so we should make getParamString() more robust.\n\nIn particular, this problem only seems to come up if the first query arg has a blank value ... any other arg can be lnak no problem.\n\nto reproduce, get the example Jetty/Solr port up and running, and then use the form i'll attach in a moment to query it. Both the GET form and the POST form should work fine initially, and the GET form should work even if you delete the \"gahgah\" and/or the \"googoo\" options ... but the POST form will not work at all if the \"gahgah\" option is removed leaving that text box blank.",
