            "content": "Here is a patch. Its a 10.5% QPS improvement on Mike's London benchmark. I also see similar improvements doing queries around my house in geonames.\n\nChanges:\n\n\tvisit(int, byte[]) does range checks on individual points. This is cheap, removes \"false positives\" to speed up two-phase intersection, and BKD has read the data already anyway.\n\trange checks in visit(int, byte[]) and compare(min, max) just work on the binary form.\n\t2nd phase iterator uses the two-stage haversin from the distance sort when possible to reject candidates faster.\n\n "
