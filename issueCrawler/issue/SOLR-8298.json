    "description": "Towards rebasing the SOLR-6730 patch after SOLR-6832 and other changes - proposed patch against trunk to follow.\n\nexisting calling chain:\n\n\tResponseBuilder.addRequest(... ShardRequest sreq) does sreq.rb = this; so that later on HttpShardHandler.submit(ShardRequest sreq ...) can do sreq.rb.req.getOriginalParams().getBool for CommonParams.PREFER_LOCAL_SHARDS\n\n\n\nproposed alternative calling chain:\n\n\tHttpShardHandler.prepDistributed(ResponseBuilder rb) sets rb.preferredHostAddress and SearchHandler calls ShardHandler.submit(ShardRequest sreq ... rb.preferredHostAddress)\n\n\n\nstructural changes:\n\n\tShardRequest.rb member removed in favour of a new ResponseBuilder.preferredHostAddress member.\n\tString preferredHostAddress argument added to the abstract ShardHandler.submit method (and to two derived (test) classes' submit methods also).\n\t\npublic void submit(ShardRequest sreq, String shard, ModifiableSolrParams params) { submit(sreq, shard, params, null); } \n\n added to avoid having to change ShardHandler.submit callers which don't have a concept of preferring a local shard e.g. for PeerSync requests.",

There should be no actual change here compared to the SOLR-6832 logic i.e. this is only a small implementation refactor. Thank you. ",
