Latest supported version is 4.1.2: https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-clover-open-source\n\nAfter opensourcing it was foked and OpenClover was founded: http://openclover.org/\n\nThe latest OpenClover version is 4.2.1.\n\nThis will issue will migrate to the opensourced OpenClover 4.2.1 version (also in preparation for Java 9). It will mainly remove the license file and cleans up the build to no longer refer to it.",
