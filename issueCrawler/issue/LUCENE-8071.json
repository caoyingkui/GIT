The circle is created with two sectors but the circle plane is too big and the shape is bogus.\n\nI will attach a test and a proposed solution. (I hope this is the last issue of this saga)",

I have realized as well that the shape has always a minimum of two sectors. Therefore there is a lot of code that can be removed as it is checking for number of sectors lower than 2.\n ",

That is the fundamental difference.\n\nI think the fix is reasonable although I am not certain there aren't other cases besides the initial split where this same logic would be needed. ",

I will move this shape to the spatial4j wrapper if it is ok with you. ",
