There are several things should be handled in other issues\n\n\tRolling update is not possible since Http2SolrClient can't talk to old Solr node (because of https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/1308).\n\tIn the past, all the updates are sent in a single stream from the leader, the replica will create a single thread to parse all the updates. For the simplicity of this ticket, the replica will parse updates in different threads.\n\n ",
