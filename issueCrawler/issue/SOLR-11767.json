            "content": "Hey Rodney, building a CRD for Solr is something I've been investigating for a while. I've built some small POCs which are far from production ready. For us, we use bare-metal and local storage and unfortunately the state of local storage in kubernetes just isn't there yet although there are some things in the works that look exciting.\n\nThis could potentially work if you use network storage, as that is slightly more solved for in the kube world, unfortunately that wont work for us and isn't a path we researched. In my original POC I built a CRD controller which used empty-dir with the idea of deploying ephemeral sandboxes of solrcloud, again not really a production solution. ",
