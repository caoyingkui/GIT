    "description": "The the released pom for solrj 3.6.0 doesn't include the require dependency to httpclient 4.1.3. If I look to the grandparent, I can see that it is dependency managed, but it does appear as an actual dependency. When trying to use org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer, one gets a compile error:\n\nclass file for org.apache.http.client.HttpClient not found\n       solr = new ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer(\"http://localhost:8983/solr\", QUEUE_SIZE, THREAD_COUNT);\n\nPutting the dependency in fixes the problem, but that isn't something the developer should have to do.",
