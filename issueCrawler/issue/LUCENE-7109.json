    "description": "Currently, the calculation this thing does is very expensive, and gets slower the more complex the polygon is. Doing everything in one phase is really bad for performance.\n\nLater, there are a lot of optimizations we can do. But I think we should try to beef up testing first. This is just to improve from galapagos-tortoise-slow to turtle-slow.",
