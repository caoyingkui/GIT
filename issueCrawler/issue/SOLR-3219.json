    "description": "When using CommonsHttpSolrServer, nothing gets logged by SolrJ at the INFO level.  When using StreamingUpdateSolrServer, I have seen two messages logged each time it is used:\n\nMar 08, 2012 4:41:01 PM org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.StreamingUpdateSolrServer$Runner run\nINFO: starting runner: org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.StreamingUpdateSolrServer$Runner@6bf28508\nMar 08, 2012 4:41:01 PM org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.StreamingUpdateSolrServer$Runner run\nINFO: finished: org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.StreamingUpdateSolrServer$Runner@6bf28508\n\nI think one of these behaviors should be considered a bug.  My preference is to move the logging in SUSS out of INFO so it is silent like CHSS.  If the decision is to leave it at INFO, I'll just live with it.  A knob to make it configurable would be cool, but that's probably a fair amount of work.",

But I don't really care if it stays or changes.  'Bug' seems extreme to me "
