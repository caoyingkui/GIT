    "description": "While investigating SOLR-2314 i found a bug which seems to be the opposite of the behavior described there \u2013 so i'm filing a seperate bug to track it.\n\nif ReplicationHandler is only configured as a master, \"command=details\" requests won't include the \"master\" section.  that section is only output if it is also configured as a slave.\n\nthe method responsible for the details command generates the \"master\" details just fine, but the code to add it to the response seems to have erroneously been nested inside an if that only evaluates to true if there is a non-null SnapPuller (ie: it's also a slave)",

            "content": "enhanced the test to also look at the details command for a repeater.\n\nthis required some rather invasive refactoring of the test in order to be able to construct a SolrInstance which was both a master and a slave \u2013 but i think on the whole the test is improved (logic added for dealing with arbitrary \"solrconfig-${name}.xml\" files in SolrInstance constructor, and a lot of config file copying was refactored into common methods)\n\nIf there are no objections, i'll commit ASAP.
