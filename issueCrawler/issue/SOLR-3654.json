Also, if all Jetty tests now use JettySolrRunner, we have a single point of entry to plug in container randomization further down the road. This could be controlled by options so that Jetty is default but nightly builds randomize container per run. "

Many of our users depend on Solr working with their app-servers, especially the OEMs, so such radical change of direction cannot be made without a thorough discussion and preferably a [VOTE].\n\nPlease continue voice your view, and aid in constructive planning for how and when Solr could (if it should) become a standalone app rather than a WAR - also consulting the user community, but it is not constructive to block test quality progress in 4.0 as long as 4.0 is planned to be a WAR release as before.
