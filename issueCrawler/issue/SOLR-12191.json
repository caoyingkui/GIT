There's this paragraph (line 43ff):\n\n\n[IMPORTANT]\n====\nThe `copyField` command can use a wildcard (*) character in the `dest` parameter only if the `source` parameter contains one as well. `copyField` uses the matching glob from the source field for the `dest` field name into which the source content is copied.\n====\n\n\n\nThe page could probably be improved some to have more examples with the text, but first I wanted to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding your original idea when you filed this.
