    "description": "At the moment, if you want to write unit tests for Cloud components, you have to extend AbstractDistribZkTestCase, which has a number of disadvantages:\n\n\tthe API isn't well-documented\n\tyou get a default configuration loaded into ZK, and it's not trivial to add separate ones\n\tyou get a default collection, whether you want one or not\n\tthe test cluster isn't static, which means that it's started up and shutdown after every test function.  To avoid tests being incredibly slow, we end up writing single-function tests that call out to sub-functions, losing the benefits of execution-order randomization.\n\n\n\nIt would be more useful to have a properly configurable and documented testcase base class.",

            "content": "Here's a patch.  The base class uses a MiniSolrCloudCluster, and exposes a Builder interface to configure it.  You can give it a solr.xml (either as a Path or a String), and add configs that will be uploaded when the cluster starts.\n\nI initially wanted to implement this as a junit ExternalResource that could be added as a ClassRule, but unfortunately this puts it outside the BeforeClass/AfterClass boundaries of LuceneTestCase and it falls foul of things like the ThreadLeak tracker.
