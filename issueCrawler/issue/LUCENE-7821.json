    "description": "A post on the solr-user mailing list drew my attention to the fact that this is apparently a valid range query under the QueryParser.jj grammer (both for the classic parser and the solr variant \u2013 i didn't check flexible)...\n\n\n[x z]       // parsed the same as [x TO z]\n\n\n\nit's parsed as a valid range query even though there is no {{ TO }} \u2013 even though there is nothing in the docs to suggest that the {{ TO }} is intended to be optional.\n\nFurthermore, in my experimenting i realized that how the grammer looks for the {{ TO }} keyword seems to be a bit sloppy, making some range queries that should be easy to validate (because they are unambiguous) fail to parse...\n\n\n[TO TO z]     // fails\n[a TO TO]     // fails\n[a TO \"TO\"]   // works, but why should quoting be neccessary here?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \"sloppy\" parsing behavior is intentional, then the docs should reflect that the {{ TO }} is optional \u2013 but it seems like in general we should make these other unambiguous cases parse cleanly.",
