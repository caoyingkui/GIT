    "description": "By default dataimport.properties is written to \n{solr.home}\n/conf/.  However when using multiple solr cores, it is currently useful to use the same conf directory for all of the cores and use solr.xml to specify a different schema.xml.  I can then specify a different data-config.xml for each core to define how the data gets from the database to each core's shema.\n\nHowever, all the solr cores will fight over writing to the dataimport.properties file.  There should be an option in solrconfig.xml to specify the location or name of this file so that a different one can be used for each core.",

            "content": "+1 I am looking at implementing with current trunk. I'll hopefully submit a patch to this. Keep in mind this may have to be added to the core configuration area to keep backward compatibility. \n\nSomething like:\n\n<core name=\"users_001\" instanceDir=\"users\" config=\"solrconfig.xml\" dataDir=\"../users_001\" dataImportPropertiesFile=\"../users_001/di.properties\"/>\n<core name=\"users_002\" instanceDir=\"users\" config=\"solrconfig.xml\" dataDir=\"../users_002\" dataImportPropertiesFile=\"../users_002/di.properties\"/>\n\nThis would operation just like todays core config:\n\n$SOLR_HOME/users\n          /users/conf\n          /users/conf/solrconfig.xml\n          /users/conf/schema.xml\n          /users_001\n          /users_001/data\n          /users_001/di.properties\n          /users_002\n          /users_002/data\n          /users_002/di.properties\n\nThis allows the core configuration and sharding to work effectively. The core question is how this would play with zookeeper / cloud support.\n\nI would think this should already be baked into SolrCloud.... but I could be wrong. Any thoughts? "

Instead we store the 'last_index_time' (one for each core) in a DB table and use a sub-query to pull it out.\n\nSELECT\n   ...\nWHERE\n   date_modified > (SELECT `value` FROM `meta` WHERE `key`='solr.dataimporter.last_index_time')\n\nWe run delta imports from a script so we can simply update the 'last_index_time' in that process (add a sleep() to make sure delta kicks in before the 'last_index_time' is updated). I'm sure there are better solutions that could trigger the update within Solr. "
