In this case, admin operations should operate on the collection rather than the alias.\n\nAdditionally we should have some tests to insure that alias resolution takes precedence for adds and searches in this case.",

In large, complex installations the \"fail early\" principle holds I think.\n\nThe alternative is to fail silently. By that I mean we have an alias pointing to a collection that doesn't exist. If we just ignore the collection that doesn't exist then it'll be hard to track down.\n\nI'll work up a patch for same, but won't commit until after people come back from the holidays and have a chance to comment.
