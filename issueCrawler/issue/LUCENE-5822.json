Specifically relied on Spark and Mesos as examples.  Other layouts might work better though.\n\tI made sure all details in our current /README.txt made it over to the new version of the README\n\tThere's now some overlap between the root README.md and the solr/README.txt file.  Specifically, both cover basic bin/solr usage.  I thought about removing it from the root README my patch creates, but that seems like a piece of info that unfamiliar users would expect in a root README.  Then I thought about removing it from solr/README.txt, but it looks like that file is what gets put in the packaged Solr downloads, and those should definitely have info on running Solr.  Maybe the duplication isn't a big deal.  Just wanted to bring it up.\n\n ",

Older Jenkins versions did not have the option to not fail the build if there were no artifacts, so the README.txt was always archived as a dummy (small file less hassle) \n\nAs ASF Jenkins updated recently to newer version, I was able to remove the README.txt file and check the new option to not fail the build if no artifacts are there.

The problem is only if you change fundamental facts of the build (like Java versions,... - or the README file!), in that case it is good to run it! But it requires lot of setup on the local machine - exact ANT/Java versions,...\n\nIn short: I'd always commit and wait what Jenkins says.
