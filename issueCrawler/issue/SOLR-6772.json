    "description": "This is a follow-on ticket from SOLR-3862 ... The goal here is to support regex based field value removal for the following use cases:\n\n1. You may not know the values you like to remove, imagine a permissioning case: [ user-u1, user-u2, group-g1 ] where you want to remove all users (ie user-.*)\n\n2. You may have a large number of values an it would be expensive to list them all but you could encapsulate in a regex.",
