Just two comments:\n\n\n\tComputePlanActionTest.testSelectedCollections has operations.get(1); but it should be request = operations.get(1);\n\tComputePlanAction has an unused import for class org.apache.solr.common.util.Pair; which will fail precommit\n\n\n\nEverything else looks good. +1 to commit.
