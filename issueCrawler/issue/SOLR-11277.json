We\u2019ve had some occurrences of really huge tlogs, resulting in serious issues, so in an attempt to avoid this, it would be great to have a \u201cmaxSize\u201d setting based on the tlog size on disk.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: Me, and Rupa are coworkers and I\u2019ve discussed this idea, and looked at this code before reviewing it here.\n\nThis looks really good! I'll be adding to this feedback, but here are a few things to start looking at:\n\nCommitTracker.java\n\n\tSIZE_COMMIT_DELAY_MS can be static\n\n\n\nDirectUpdateHandler2.java\n\n\tCan we rename fileSizeUpperBound to tLogFileSizeUpperBound? Just so that it\u2019s clear?\n\tIn addedDocument, we should extract a method for the docsUpperBound part as well. It\u2019s not directly a part of your change, but would be good to do while we are at it.\n\tCan we define a fileSizeUpperBound value of -1 to a static final and use it instead of hardcoding it in the CommitTracker constructor ?\n\tWe need the currentTlogSize at multiple places, we should extract that into a method\n\n\n\nSolrConfig.java\n\n\tconvertAutoCommitMaxSizeStringToBytes is more generic, so either we should rename it to a more generic name like convertConfigStringToBytes or we should call it getAutoCommitMaxSizeInBytes, not pass the path, and have it default to -1.\n\tThe Javadoc for convertAutoCommitMaxSizeStringToBytes doesn\u2019t mention that it returns -1 when autoCommitMaxSizeStr is not set.\n\tI would like more information to be spit out with the RuntimeException. A good idea would be to highlight what the correct/accepted format looks like.\n\tUpdateHandlerInfo constructor now has autoCommitMaxSize but is missing the entry from the Javadoc\n\n\n\nTransactionLog.java\n\n\tSynchronizing is required in getLogSizeFromStream(), but can we run a basic benchmark to make sure that this isn\u2019t impacting the update throughput?\n\n\n\nbad-solrconfig-no-autocommit-tag.xml\n\n\tCan you add one line about what is this config used for. It would be a good idea to just replace the current \u201cMinimal  solrconfig.xml with /select, /admin, and /update\u2026.\u201d line.\n\n\n\nThanks for adding the javadocs to older methods and removing commented out code from years ago too   ",
