    "description": "The 2 arg version of the \"query()\" was designed so that the second argument would specify the value used for any document that does not match the query pecified by the first argument \u2013 but the \"exists\" property of the resulting ValueSource only takes into consideration wether or not the document matches the query \u2013 and ignores the use of the second argument.\n\n\n\nThe work around is to ignore the 2 arg form of the query() function, and instead wrap he query function in def().\n\nfor example:  def(query($something), $defaultval) instead of query($something, $defaultval)",

            "content": "This is working as designed.\n\nThe change in behavior is due to a bug that was fixed in the underlying math ValueSources in 5.0, and explicitly called out in the Solr upgrading instructions for 5.0...\n\nBugs fixed in several ValueSource functions may result in different behavior in situations where some documents do not have values for fields wrapped in other value sources. Users who want to preserve the previous behavior may need to wrap fields in the \"def()\" function. Example: changing \"fl=sum(fieldA,fieldB)\" to \"fl=sum(def(fieldA,0.0),def(fieldB,0.0))\". See LUCENE-5961 for more details. \n\nUsing the techproducts example data the various options are easy to compare...\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?x=id:USD&q=cat:currency&fl=id,query%28$x%29,sum%281,query%28$x%29%29,sum%281,def%28query%28$x%29,0%29%29\n\n\n ",
