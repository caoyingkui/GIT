There aren't any and so it would seem obvious to update the precommit checks (and Eclipse settings) to prevent future introductions.",

The warning list by Jenkins is produced on Javac's output - so how does that relate to each other?\n\nI agree we should primarily fix the Oracle Javac warnings (mostly rawtypes or unsafe casts and a few try-resources and fall-through warnings), but I can also work on enabling warning reports for the eclipse compiler on Policeman Jenkins. But making it a failure for some cases (as you did) is also fine.  ",
