With multiple/many child nodes in the node list that would be repeated methods calls nonetheless, all returning the same result since the list doesn't change, so this is meant to be very minor optimisation (the extra `int nlLen` presumably doesn't really cost since even when called within the for-loop the getLength() result needs to be stored?).
