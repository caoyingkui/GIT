    "description": "The TokenStream class has a close() method which must be called afterthe token stream has been exhausted (i.e. next() returns null) torelease underlying resources held by the stream, such as a Reader.This method invocation is essential in cases where TokenStreams areexpensive to set up and the Analyzer decides to cache them, becausethe call to close is how the token stream knows to clean up.The QueryParser violates this contract by creating and using TokenStreamsbut not closing them.  The getFieldQuery method is an example of this.I suggest rewriting this portion:while (true) {      try \n{        t = source.next();      }\n      catch (IOException e) \n{        t = null;      }\n      if (t == null)        break;      v.addElement(t.termText());    }as follows:try {  Token t = null;  while ((t = source.next()) != null) {    v.addElement(t.termText());  }} catch (IOException ioe) \n{  // this should be raised, not swallowed as it currently is  // the TokenStream writer may have raised an IOException that needs  // to be handled}\n finally \n{  source.close(); // must do this!}\nThere may be other instances of this problem which also need to have the call to TokenStream.close() added.",
