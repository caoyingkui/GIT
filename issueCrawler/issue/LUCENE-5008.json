            "content": "This is an invalid issue. Please read the javadocs of TopDocs:\n\n\n  /** The total number of hits for the query. */\n  public int totalHits;\n\n  /** The top hits for the query. */\n  public ScoreDoc[] scoreDocs;\n\n\n\ntotalHits denotes the total number of documents that match the query in the index. When you submit your query, you specify the number of \"top docs\" to return (e.g. 10). scoreDocs.length <= the number you specify (e.g. if there are less hits that match the query).\n\nResolving as Not A Problem. I personally usually ask a question on the user/dev list before I open an issue, to validate the problem is indeed an issue. I think it would be best if you follow the same practice in the future. ",
