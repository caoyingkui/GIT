It also would mean that change occurred in version range specified there - unfortunately I would not be able to test that.\n\nThis looks like a change in behaviour is not quite expected: now introducing pf2 searches for documents that must have 'cat dog' phrase instead of just boosting such documents.\n\nPlease let me know if more information is required.",
