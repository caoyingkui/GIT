    "description": "September 28th 2003 contribution from \"Pierrick Brihaye\"\n<pierrick.brihaye@wanadoo.fr>.\n\nOriginal email:\n\nHi all,\n\nI have written a Lucene Analyzer for arabic. You will find it here :\nhttp://perso.wanadoo.fr/pierrick.brihaye/ArabicAnalyzer.jar \n(provisional\nadress, anybody interested in hosting it ?)\n\nThis work is still in beta stage but it gives quite good results \n\nIn order to make it work, you need :\n\n1) a 1.4+ JVM (because of the native support for regular expressions \nwhich\nare heavily used in the program ; I've been too lazy to use an external\npackage)\n\n2) Apache Jakarta Commons-Collections :\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections.html\n\n3) a recent Lucene distribution \n\nAll this work is based on the amazing Tim Buckwalter's Arabic \nMorphological\nAnalyzer Version 1.0\n(http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2002L49)\noriginaly written in Perl and released under the GPL.\n\nThe jar contains :\n\na) the compiled classes\nb) the required data files (dictionaries and compatibility tables)\nc) 2 command-line test programs\nd) 3 test documents with different encodings\ne) the source code\nf) a README file that will give you a little bit more of information \n\n\nTo Lucene developers : I plan to offer this work to Lucene (see the jar\nhierarchy... and the source file headers . Any objections ?\n\nFeedback is very welcome : there are quite a lot of unresolved issues, \nwith\nthe analyzer itselfs as well as with Lucene.\n\nmE AlslAmap, cheers,\n\np.b.",
