Currently all I/O in all tokenizers is broken and buggy, and does not correctly handle special cases around their 'buffering'.\n\nThe only one that is correct is CharTokenizer, but at what cost? It has so much complexity because of this Reader issue.\n\nWe should stop pretending like we can really stream docs with Reader.\nWe should stop pretending like 8GB documents or something exist, where we cant just analyze the whole doc at once and make things simple.\nAnd then we can fix the lucene tokenizers to be correct.

Just including it here is case somebody want to apply the patch directly to 3.0.1 (although it's better to wait for 3.1)\n\nYour fix adds an addtional complexity. Just reset the buffer back to the default ZZ_BUFFERSIZE if grown on reset. Your patch always reallocates a new buffer.\n\nUse this:\n\npublic final void reset(Reader r) {\n  // reset to default buffer size, if buffer has grown\n  if (zzBuffer.length > ZZ_BUFFERSIZE) {\n    zzBuffer = new char[ZZ_BUFFERSIZE];\n  }\n  yyreset(r);\n}\n\n ",
