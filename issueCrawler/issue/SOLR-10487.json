    "description": "This issue pertains to SolrEntityProcessor for importing documents from one Solr to another over HTTP. There have been instances when the DataImportHandler (DIH) hangs due to network/LB level issues. The abort command fails to stop the in-progress frozen import process. The DIH remains in this state for days and does not accept new request for import until Solr restart. The current implementation of SolrEntityProcessor has timeout at query level only.\n\nThere should be option to specify connection as well as socket read timeouts. The import process must fail in case of any anomaly and not remain in hung state.",

Queries can easily take longer than 30 seconds if the index is hosted on hardware that doesn't have enough resources.\n\nAlso, the specific methods you are using (setConnectionTimeout, setSoTimeout) are slated for deprecation and will most likely be gone in version 7.0.  See SOLR-8975 and its subtasks.  The settings must be handled when the client is first built with its Builder object, and until methods are available at the level of the Builder for the SolrClient, it is best to set them when creating the HttpClient object.

At this moment, I cannot see a way of setting the timeout values at HttpClient level. The values are to be set in HttpSolrClient object. The connectionTimeout and socketTimeout values come into effect by passing them to HttpClient.execute() method (wrapped in HttpRequestBase object). Probably it is best to wait for the SolrClientBuilder task to be completed. ",

I have changed the HttpClient handling a little bit as well as applying the timeouts using methods that aren't slated for deprecation.\n\nI marked the TIMEOUT constant as deprecated because that seemed to be the intent, but it appears that the replacement (QUERY_TIMEOUT) is not actually being used.  I wasn't entirely sure what the intent was, so I did not attempt to fix that.  This still needs to be done.\n\nSide discussion: In HttpSolrClient#close, I was able to remove the \"throws\" part of the signature without causing any errors in HttpSolrClient, but there were some other places in the code that DID have errors as a result, so that is going to require some more thought.

Missed the changes while merging from Solr 6 branch (my cluster runs on Solr 6.2). \n\nIncorporated above changes in the attached patch. Also pushed to forked repo. ",
