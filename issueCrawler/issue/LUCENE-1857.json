            "content": "Patch that adds generics:\nAfter thinking about it the whole night: The \"static ctors\" cannot be removed, because even with generics there is not type safety. The private ctor needs the valSize information, to choose the right term encoding. This could theoretically be determined by instanceof checks, but would not work, if you use null for both upper and lower bounds.\nThis generified version is easier to handle, because it returns the correct type when calling getMin()/getMax(). It also uses generics for its collections api usage. ",
