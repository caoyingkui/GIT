I worked around this problem by defining the *.jar properties statically.\n\nMy build times now:\n\n\n\n\ntask\ntrunk\npatch\npatch w/property passing optimizations\n\n\nant example (clean checkout)\n180s\n119s\n93s\n\n\nant example (already compiled)\n132s\n61s\n55s\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shaves a few more seconds off my build time.
