The attached patch fixes the failed test mentioned here, but another test fails later on:\n\n  <testcase classname=\"org.apache.solr.servlet.CacheHeaderTest\" name=\"testCacheVetoException\" time=\"0.795\">\n    <failure message=\"We got no Expires header\" type=\"junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\">junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: We got no Expires header\n        at org.apache.solr.servlet.CacheHeaderTest.checkVetoHeaders(CacheHeaderTest.java:74)\n        at org.apache.solr.servlet.CacheHeaderTest.testCacheVetoException(CacheHeaderTest.java:59)\n</failure>\n  </testcase>\n\nFrom reading the HTTP 1.1 RFC, the Expires header is essential for the correct operation of HTTP 1.0 caches (that may ignore the \"Cache-Control: no-cache\" header). That means disabling the test would be incorrect. I haven't been able to find out where the Expires: headers is supposed to be generated.\n\nCheers\n\nJan-Pascal "
