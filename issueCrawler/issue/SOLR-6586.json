For example, the ReplicationHandler is registered so that it's getStatistics neeeds to be called twice if you go through all of the SolrInfoMBeans. However, because it's called for each attribute, it's actually called 2 * number of atrribs times. Because the replication handler does things like getting the size of the index directory, this is fairly wasteful.\n\nIt seems one option around it is to implement getters for each attribute on the ReplicationHandler and other SolrInfoMBeans. That seems quite cumbersome and long term annoying though. ",
