            "content": "In a nutshell: adding ex=studies_range to your facet.pivot local params should give you the results you are looking for \n\n\n\nThe behavior you are seeing was a deliberate choice when adding support for hanging stats off of pivots (SOLR-6351), because the pivot itself can define the exclusions to be used when computing the pivot constraint counts (and the stats associated with each constraint) ... otherwise it's too ambiguous as to what should happen if different exclusion tags are specified on the facet.pivot and the stats.field, see these specific comments...\n\n\n\thttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-6351?focusedCommentId=14091538&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14091538\n\thttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-6351?focusedCommentId=14144161&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14144161\n\n\n\n\nOne final note...\nwe need to think carefully about \"exclusions\" because they might be different \n\nMy current thinking (reflected in the steps i've outlined above) is that we should go this route...\ni think what we want in general is for the \"ex\" localparam of the stats.field to be ignored when hanging off of a facet.pivot\n\nOf the 2 alternatives i proposed before:\n\n\t\"union the exclusions\" \u2013 extremeley impractical.\n\t\"fail if they both specify 'ex' and they aren't identical\" \u2013 very possible/easy to do if people think it's less confusing, it just requires a bit more code. we can easily go this route if we run into problems and decide it makes the API cleaner.\n\n\n ",
