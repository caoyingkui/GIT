    "description": "A RawResponseWriter writes a ContentStream directly to the response.\n\nThis is useful to spit back a file directly from solr.  This implementation looks for a response property named \"content\" and sends it to the client.  If it can't find one, it delegates the response to another ResponseWriter.\n\nAs an example, I added a GetAdminFileRequestHandler to replace /admin/get-file.jsp",

            "content": "Ryan, i really like the idea of a RawResponseWriter, and your GetAdminFileRequestHandler ... for a hwile now i've been thinking that it would be good to change the admin/gettableFiles section of hte solrconfig so that...\n\n\tfiles could have a default content-type specified\n\tdirecotries could be listed (with a content-type to assume for all files in that directory)\n...and then replace get-file.jsp with a servlet that used the extra path info to find the filename, and supported query args to override the default content-type with text/plain\n\n\n\nmy motivation being to help with things like SOLR-75 where we sometimes need the schema as XML, but othertimes we want to return it as plain text ... and to let the XmlResponseWriter start supporting useful params telling it what stylesheet from the xslt directory to include in the response (for client site styling using a stylesheet served from the solr server)\n\n \u2013 but i like your idea of a RequestHandler/ResponseWriter better.\n\nwe should consier deprecating admin/gettableFiles completley, and moving the info about what file are gettable directly into the init params for the GetAdminFileRequestHandler (where it can also support the content-type/direcotry stuff that i described)\n\nin that case, we'd need to leave get-files.jsp where it is, so something still supports the legacy admin/gettableFiles list of files.

It may be getting away from my original goal to get a RawRequestHandler committed soon... but oh well.\n\nThis adds RequestHandlers for a bunch of admin thing that could (should) be spit back in the standard response writer format.\n\nsome urls to check:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/file\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/file?file=protwords.txt\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/file?file=schema.xml\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/file?file=schema.xml&txt=true\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/threads\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/registry\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/registry?wt=json&indent=true\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/stats\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/ping\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/properties\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/properties?name=java.home\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/logging\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/logging?set=FINE\n\nTo get these to display nicely, we would need an xls file and link to:\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/stats?stylesheet=admin.xls\n\nI like this direction because it moves solr away from the need for a JDK, removes a bunch of code from jsp scriptlets, and makes the admin info easily available to clients through JSON/xml etc. "
