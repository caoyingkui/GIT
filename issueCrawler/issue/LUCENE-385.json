    "description": "Many people use Lucene to index a part of their file system. The chance that  \nyou some day mix up index directory and document directory isn't that bad.  \nCurrently Lucene will delete all files in the index directory when the  \ncreate paramater passed to IndexWriter is true, thus deleting your documents \nif you mixed up the parameters. I'll attach a patch that fixes  \nthis. Any objections?",
