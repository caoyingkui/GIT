            "content": "Hi Tobias,\n\nSo the proposed change is to move dataimport/AbstractDIHCacheTestCase.java (and some or all of its fellow test cases) in solr/contrib/dataimporthandler/src/test/org/apache/solr/handler to solr/test-framework/src/java/org/apache/solr/handler so that custom DIH code could also use the AbstractDataImportHandlerTestCase class, did I understand that correctly?\n\nI am not familiar with solr/contrib/dataimporthandler or solr/contrib/dataimporthandler-extras but am wondering if an alternative solution might perhaps also exist e.g. in SOLR-9306 it was possible to give solr/contrib/analysis-extras's test classes access to lucene/analysis's test classes.

Steve Rowe or others might know, I don't know but would like to better understand about this too. ",
