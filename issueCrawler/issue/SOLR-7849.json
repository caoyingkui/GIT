    "description": "Relying on every Authentication plugin to secure the internode communication is error prone. Solr can standardize the authentication so that only the first request that comes from outside the cluster needs to be authenticated by the authentication plugin\n\nThe scheme to protect the communication will be as follows\n\n\n\tEvery Solr node creates a an RSA key pair\n\tThe private key is kept private and the public key is made available through a  core admin API\n\tIf authentication is enabled , every outgoing request will carry an extra header {{ SolrAuth : <nodename> encrypt_with_pvt_key(<original-user-principal> <timestamp>) }}\n\tIf authentication is enabled SolrDispatchFilter would look for this header and see the nodename\n\t\n\t\tIf the public key of the nodename is available in cache , make a request to the node and fetch the public key\n\t\tIf the public key has changed (because of a server restart) decryption fails and the public keyis fetched again\n\t\n\t\n\tIf the decryption succeeds , the user-name is set to what the header has encoded",

            "content": "How will node B be able to lookup the public key from core admin API of node A if A requires B to also authenticate? Perhaps publish pub-key through ZK instead of core admin?\n\nThe public-key will be available at every node through a standard end-point e.g /admin/cores/key which will always be unprotected\n\n\nWhat should happen in multi-DC case; would cross cluster communication be treated as \"internal\"? \n\nThat mechanism will have to be sorted out. Not a part of this ticket\n\ne.g : node-A in DC1 cluster wants to lookup node-P in DC2 cluster. We will publish the zk address of DC2 cluster in ZK of DC1 cluster and vice versa. This way node-A will trust al nodes in DC2 cluster as well\n\nWhat would <original-user-principal> be in case the action is initiated by Solr and not an external request?\n\nIt will be a standard string like '$' which means the node itself is the principal ",

In PKIAuthenticationPlugin,\n\n  private int maxValidity = 5000;\n\n\nAm I correct in my understanding that the difference of received internode request's timestamp and current timestamp shouldn't be more than this maxValidity? If that's true, I think an out of the box default of 5 secs is too less. Unless, we require all nodes to be using NTP; is that the plan? Also, shouldn't this be admin/user configurable? ",
