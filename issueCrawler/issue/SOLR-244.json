    "description": "The existing ways to change parameters at runtime are awkward, this is a class I have been using in SOLR-20.  It is a solr params implementation with two nice additions:\n\n  public void set( String name, String ... val ) \n{\n   ... \n  }\n\n  public void add( String name, String ... val ) \n{\n  ...\n  }\n\nRather then have a new class, it may be better to augment MultiMapSolrParams to include a default constructor and use set/add to modify the final Map<String,String[]>",
