            "content": "I'm having problems during indexing where it doesn't index the entire file for \nlarger text files. I have attached two text files, each with the word \"bozo\" \nat the end of the file. After indexing the smaller text file, a search will \nshow a hit for the word bozo. After indexing the larger text file, a search \nwill not find any hits for the word bozo.\n\nI originally discovered this problem when reading a socket. The socket was \nreading from a file, and the input stream was passed in to the addDocument. \nDuring the IndexWriter's addDocument() method, it stopped reading from the \nsocket - it didn't read all of the contents. I wrote this little test program \nto read straight from a file, and I am seeing the same problem. I don't see \nany errors - it just seems to stop reading.\n\nThe smaller text file is ~82 KB, and the larger one is around 86 KB. Here is \nthe output I get from running the test program (I have attached the source \ncode and both of my test files):\n\nEnter in file name to read:\nc:\\temp\\smaller.txt\nc:\\temp\\smaller.txt is 83649 bytes.\nEnter in text to search for:\nbozo\nFound 1 hits.\n\nEnter in file name to read:\nc:\\temp\\larger.txt\nc:\\temp\\larger.txt is 87183 bytes.\nEnter in text to search for:\nbozo\nFound 0 hits.
