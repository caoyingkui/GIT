    "description": "SpanPayloadCheckQuery currently takes a Collection<byte[]> to check its payloads against.  This is suboptimal a) because payloads internally use BytesRef rather than byte[] and b) Collection is unordered, but the implementation does actually care about the order in which the payloads appear.\n\nWe should change the constructor to take a List<BytesRef> instead.",
