I've attached a patch which implements the second version.\n\nShawn Heisey you would need to also modify the query.html file in partials to, for example:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"spellcheck['spellcheck.collate']\" name=\"spellcheck.collate\" id=\"spellcheck_collate\" ng-value-true=\"'on'\" ng-value-false=\"'off'\"> ",
