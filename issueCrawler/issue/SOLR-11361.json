    "description": "I have just updated from Solr 6.2.1 to 6.6.1.  I put into place a fresh 6.6.1 and mounted our Core (umslogs).  This loaded perfectly fine on port 8181 and our application is able to write/read data.\n\nThe problem started when I restart Solr 6.6.1 and the below error appeared after Solr 6.6.1 came up accessible via the web page. \n\n*HttpSolrCall\nnull:org.apache.solr.core.SolrCoreInitializationException: SolrCore 'umslogs' is not available due to init failure: null *\n\nNext my testing lead me to start up Solr on port 8282 that no application is connecting/reading/writing to.  On this test umslogs core loads is perfectly fine after erroring above.\n\nNext my testing lead me to close our application that writes/reads to Solr 8181umslogs core and shutdown Solr 8282 umslogs core.  Then  I restarted  Solr back on Poret 8181 and the umslogs core loads properly and our application that that writes/reads to Solr 8181 is once again operational.\n\nOur application has used Solr 4.10.x, then Solr 6.2.x okay.  Then again I do not doubt that I might have done something wrong with the 6.6.1 upgrade that is causing the above behavior",

The problem that I am seeing in v6.6.1 does not appear to happen in v6.6.0\n\nFor the record, I am running from Windows Command Line just using the -p 8181 or 8282 argument. \n\nIs this because of this error Lock held by this virtual machine:.  After a bit of time Solr 6.6.0 had the same error but the Core was still operational.  I stop 8181, move to port 8282 and there are no hard errors listed.  I move back to 8181 and the error is back.  Lastly I shut down Solr and just wait 30 minutes (perhaps more was not really counting) and 8181 comes up with no hard errors. ",

Therefore I found the error logging in the source code, checked out the branch_6x code, modified the code to display what directory was having the issue, and built/installed version 6.6.2-SNAPSHOT.\n\nWith the upgrade, I began having problems where cores actually did not successfully load, which is a very different problem than SOLR-11297.  I saw the \"SolrCore 'xxxxxx' is not available due to init failure: null\" message in my logs just like this issue mentions, but could not find anything in the logs that actually indicated why the core failed to initialize.
