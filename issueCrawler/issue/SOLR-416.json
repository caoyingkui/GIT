    "description": "As discussed on the mailing list, there are places in Solr where java methods that rely on the default locale are used to copare input with \"constants\" ... the specific use case that prompted this bug being string comparison after calling \"toUpperCase()\" ... this won't do what it should in some Locales...\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Invalid-value-%27explicit%27-for-echoParams-parameter-tf4837914.html\n\nwe should audit the code as much as possible and try to replace these use cases in a way that will work for everyone....",
