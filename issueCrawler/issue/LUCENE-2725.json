    "description": "Hi everyone,\nI am a CSE student of SUST, SYlhet( http://www.sust.edu/). \nI have noticed that there is no such Bengali Analyzer in Lucene for Bengali Text search and highlight. I have used Standard Analyzer and others but they do not give good result.\nSo, i have developed a Bengali Analyzer. I have tested it for 50 thousand document. And it is being used in Ekushe Finance Search Engine. (http://efinance.com.bd/). \n\nPlease give me some instruction so that i can contribute that analyzer in Lucene.\n\nThanx.",

Then i removed the stopwords and finally i filtered them.\n\nI have worked with this analyzer in some projects. It works fine. How can i contribute it to Lucene API? Can anyone give me any solution/way? ",
