            "content": "Why not broaden this and allow people to pass in their own collectors? \n\nYes, that is the general idea, though it would be API driven than configuration. Any component should be able to pass a Collector to the various SolrIndexSearcher methods.\n\nAlso, can you explain a bit more the use case specifically for Field Collapse? \n\nField Collapsing needs to use a custom collector. Right now the collector is hard coded inside SolrIndexSearcher.\n\nAlternatively, given something like LUCENE-2127, we may want Solr to be able to make query time decisions about what Collector to use.\n\nI guess that decision should be made by QueryComponent? If so, then the ability to pass a custom Collector to SolrIndexSearcher methods should be enough. "
