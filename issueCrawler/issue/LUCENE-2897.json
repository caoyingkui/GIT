    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-2324.\n\nWhen we flush deletes today, we keep them as buffered Term/Query/docIDs that need to be deleted.  But, for a newly flushed segment (ie fresh out of the DWPT), this is silly, because during flush we visit all terms and we know their docIDs.  So it's more efficient to apply the deletes (for this one segment) at that time.\n\nWe still must buffer deletes for all prior segments, but these deletes don't need to map to a docIDUpto anymore; ie we just need a Set.\n\nThis issue should wait until LUCENE-1076 is in since that issue cuts over buffered deletes to a transactional stream.",

I think we can't [easily] skip writing the postings, because could result in non-deterministic behavior (I put a comment on this in the patch).\n\nIf we did the flush w/ 2 passes (first pass to mark all del docs and 2nd to flush) then we could skip writing postings of docs that were deleted.  But I suspect that's too much cost on flush.\n\nWith a single pass, we'd end up writing some postings for the doc, but not all, depending on the order in which its terms arrived vs its deleted terms.\n\nI mean, in practice, an app is gonna delete against ID field (typically) so if we \"knew\" that down deep here in Luceneland we could do the first pass only against that one field...\n\nAlso, merge is still going to have to apply del docs, since eg stored fields have written the deleted docs.
