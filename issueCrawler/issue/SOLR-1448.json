            "content": "Are we going to be responsible for all the containers out there?\n\nI'd think we would take it on a case by case basis. We should generally work with a standards compliant container. We can see from the list that a handful of users are using weblogic - we can also see that there is a problem, and that there is a successful fix. I'm not seeing any comments about other containers that don't work (though perhaps I am missing them). I've seen the weblogic stuff enough to know about it without looking it up. In any case, I'd go case by case given the facts.\n\nHow many of us have access to Web logic to test this?\n\nIts a point, but we have this issue all the time - hence all of the, can user please test this in their environ and report back. Thats how Hoss wrangled this one out as well I believe. And more than one user has confirmed.\n\nWhat versions of WebLogic are we going to support?\n\nThe ones that users alert us don't work and have a simple fix for? We are not jumping hoops here - this is one specific setting that appears to be incompatible with the Solr admin UI. If future versions require major other changes, we would have to reassess. As it is, I think this has already been reported to make Solr admin work with 8,9, and 10. Thats a free win to me. Its a binary setting thats being set in this patch - thats it - at worse they will change it to default as we want. Which they actually did in weblogic 9 - but only if the web.xml is defined as 2.4 - and ours is 2.3 if I remember right. In any case, if a user is using a new version and reports issues, I'd think we would deal with it then based on the facts. This isn't a promise to work perfect with weblogic forever more any more than I promise to introduce no more bugs.\n\nAre we going to package different wars for different containers?\n\nNo - this is just talking about including a .4kb file that doesn't affect different containers. No one is talking about making different wars. -1 to making different wars.\n\nHow about other containers?\n\nCase by case as it should be. Hopefully most of them just work as this is supposed to be standards driven. When we have little issues like this, I'd think we go case by case.\n\nIt's a slippery slope.\n\nI don't think this little patch makes things any more slippery than they are myself. "

J2EE is busted in this respect, these types of things were meant to be controlled during deployment.  Weblogic: -1 for needing this.  Tomcat works, and it's the reference implementation.  \n\nIn the past I've had to deal with these sorts of things with Weblogic, WebSphere, and Resin (thank god we're not doing EJB!) - so I understand the pain point first hand and am ok with us including this Weblogic specific file in this case.\n\nWe'll of course revisit when/if other containers have issues.
