    "description": "kinda like SuppressCodecs, to make it easier to disable cornercases that don't play with anything we are doing at this level.\n\nthe one example we have today is LUCENE-5574, the bug just doesnt happen on windows because you can't delete open files there, so the test won't work. Today it uses a hacky method to disable mock windowsFS.\n\nBut being able to easily turn these off for rare exotic cases, will make it easier to improve/add them for the general case.",

Last i checked, it did things lucene didnt do, and lucene did things it didnt do. We added whitespaces to lucene recently at least  "

Like you said \u2013 some things will be duplicated because they're fairly Lucene-specific, but there should be a common denominator. "

It could be greatly improved to better simulate some of the things that can happen there and be consistent. Its one reason why we don't enable mock windows on windows itself.\n\nSo I think the annotation is generally useful because of that too. "
