    "description": "I'm using the version 1.4.0 of Solr and I'm having some trouble with the DIH when I use the special command $skipDoc.\n\nAfter skipping a document to insert, the next one is not inserted in the proper way.\n\n\nMy DIH configuration is quite complex so I'll try to explain myself with a simpler example:\n\nitem table:\nid \tname\n1\taaa\n2\tbbb\n\nfeature table:\nItem_id\thidden\n1\t\ttrue\n2 \t\tfalse\n\n\nDIH conf:\n\n<document name=\"products\">\n\t<entity name=\"item\" query=\"select * from item\">\n\t\t<field column=\"ID\" name=\"id\" />\n\t\t<field column=\"NAME\" name=\"name\" />\n\n\t\t<entity name=\"feature\" query=\"select hidden from feature where item_id='${item.ID}'\">\n\t\t\t<field name=\"$skipDoc\" column=\"hidden\" />\n\t\t</entity>\n\t</entity>\n</document>\n\n\nThe result I expected is that the record named \"bbb\" would be imported, but the result of my import case is that the other record (the \"aaa\") has been inserted.\n\n\nI took a look to the DIH code and I found a possible problem that could cause this result. \nIn the DocBuilder class when a $skipDoc is detected, an exception is raised. After handling the exception another loop starts, without cleaning up the doc variable.\nWhen the next record is read, the addFieldToDoc method can't fill the doc fields because they are already filled.\n\nTo solve this problem I just clean up the doc variable when handling the exception.",
