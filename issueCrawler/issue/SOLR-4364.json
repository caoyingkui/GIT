    "description": "While fixing SOLR-4225, Hoss pointed out, that a apostrophe is not the typical character for number formatting in english speaking countries - we decided to go with an generic whitespace as separator in the first place.\n\nthis issue tries to \"fix\" this, my first idea was using the browser-language to decide how to format numbers - based on the fact, that if you're using a english setup, you're able to recognize english number formatting, the same goes for german and other languages",
