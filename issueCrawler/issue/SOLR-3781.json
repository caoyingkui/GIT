This will make all the calls inside the admin.html to go against, let's say /admin/cores (invalid URL for me) instead of expected /mysolr/admin/cores\n\nif i provide my own copy of LoadAdminUiServlet, which sets app_config.solr_path='\\/mysolr', than the admin.html calls will double that for some reasons, '/mysolr/mysolr/admin/cores' instead of '/mysolr/admin/cores', i can't figure this one out.\n\n(as a hack i'm also using a copy of SolrRequestFilter which removes the double prefix if found, and now admin.html kind of works. the only thing that i still have to figure out is the zookeeper part, that one still doesn't work, not sure why is going against /zookeeper instead of /mysolr/zookeeper).\n\ni'm just using '/admin/cores' as examples here, logging and all the other URL's have the same problem.\n\nDoes this makes more sense now?\n\n\n "
