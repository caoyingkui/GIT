    "description": "LuceneJUnitResultFormatter uses a lock to buffer test suites' output, so that when run in parallel, they don't interrupt each other when they are displayed on the console.\n\nThe current implementation uses a fixed directory (lucene_junit_lock/ in java.io.tmpdir (by default /tmp/ on Unix/Linux systems) as the location of this lock.  This functionality was introduced on SOLR-1835.\n\nAs Shawn Heisey reported on SOLR-2739, some tests fail when run as root, but succeed when run as a non-root user.  \n\nOn #lucene IRC today, Shawn wrote:\n\n(2:06:07 PM) elyograg: Now that I know I can't run the tests as root, I have discovered /tmp/lucene_junit_lock.  Once you run the tests as user A, you cannot run them again as user B until that directory is deleted, and only root or the original user can do so.",
