At least it works the other way. I'll check that and report back. ",

So from my perspective it's OK to resolve this issue as Invalid.\n\n> FYI: anyone can edit the wiki if you create an account and login.\n\nYes, thanks. I probably had the page locally cached since I still got the \"immutable\" message on the page after creating an account and logging in. Now it shows up as editable, I'll update the instructions. ",
