The first line has \"hits\" and the second one doesn't, but other than that they have the same info.\n\nThese lines are from a 5.3.2-SNAPSHOT version.  In the IRC channel, Cassandra Targett confirmed that this also happens in 6.4-SNAPSHOT.\n\n\n2017-01-06 14:16:37.253 INFO  (qtp1510067370-186262) [   x:sparkmain] or.ap.so.co.So.Request [sparkmain] webapp=/solr path=/admin/ping params={} hits=400271103 status=0 QTime=4\n2017-01-06 14:16:37.253 INFO  (qtp1510067370-186262) [   x:sparkmain] or.ap.so.co.So.Request [sparkmain] webapp=/solr path=/admin/ping params={} status=0 QTime=4\n\n\n\nUnless there's a good reason to have it that I'm not aware of, the second log should be removed.",
