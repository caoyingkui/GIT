As this was never implemented (no calls) and we have no way to serialize the attributes, this is not really useful.\n\nOn TermsEnum, we currently use attributes in FuzzyQuery, to store some term metadata (like the fuzzy boost) on the enum. But anywhere else, it is also not used. One idea was to allow storing extra term metadata like payloads on the terms itsself.\n\nUwe ",
