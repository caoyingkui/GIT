They are however folded differently when people type them on a keyboard lacking these characters and ASCIIFoldingFilter handle \u00e4 and \u00e6 differently.\n\nWhen a Swedish person is lacking umlauted characters on the keyboard they consistently type a, a, o instead of \u00e5, \u00e4, \u00f6. Foreigners also tend to use a, a, o.\n\nIn Norway people tend to type aa, ae and oe instead of \u00e5, \u00e6 and \u00f8. Some use a, a, o. I've also seen oo, ao, etc. And permutations. Not sure about Denmark but the pattern is probably the same.\n\nThis filter solves that problem, but might also cause new.",

In Sweden people would write Sardal. ASCIIFoldingFilter and friends would fold \u00e6 as ae and \u00e4 as a. The mismatch is primarily when a query contains the folded text, such as Saerdal. Folding all \u00e4:s to ae will cause problem for people that just writes an a rather than \u00e4. The same sort of mismatch will occur for \u00e5->aa, \u00e5->a, \u00e5->ao, \u00f8->oe, \u00f6->o. People tend to use different permutations of these alternatives and this filter normalizes it.\n\nSo this is a filter that solves mismatching on ASCII folds for people in Norway and Denmark searching in a Swedish index and vice verse.\n\nSee what I mean?

One other example is the Norwegian word for \"berry\": b\u00e6r. With the aggressive approach it would be bar which clashes with the words for \"bare\" and \"bar\" as well as clash with b\u00e5r folded to bar. Other unfortunate Norwegian examples are b\u00f8r/bor, kl\u00e6r/kl\u00e5r/klar, f\u00e5r/far, f\u00f8r/for, kl\u00f8r/klor, m\u00f8te/mote, bl\u00e5/bla...

It makes a lot of sense to also go from \u00f8,\u00f6,oe->\u00f8 for those that are using a Scandinavian keyboard. This is a feature I too want now.\n\nBut the problem isn't just that we use \u00e4 and you use \u00e6, it's native and non speakers sitting in front of the wrong sort of keyboard. Swedish people will most definitely in that situation write raksmorgas when searching for r\u00e4ksm\u00f6rg\u00e5s and most probably blabarsyltetoj when searching for bl\u00e5b\u00e6rssyltet\u00f8j, while my guess is that an American would write raksmorgas and blabaersyltetoj.\n\n\nI ran a test too see how bad the Norwegian mismatches are using the \"Norsk scrabbleforbund\"-dictionary:\n\n593526 Norwegian words in dictionary.\n  4698 Norwegian mismatches using ScandinavianNormalizerFilter.\n  3943 Norwegian mismatches using ASCIIFoldingFilter.\n\nThat's something like 0,6%-0,8%. I find that totally acceptable, but I also suppose it depends on how you implement your index. If you're indexing nothing but the folded text then it might be a problem, but if it's something secondary on a disjunction with a lower boost, then it's hopefully just a matter of a few extra CPU-cycles and FS-seeks.

Would that cause fewer search misses and false positives, or more?

The example given on the wiki page is \u00df/SS, which honestly means little to me with my uneducated (American) viewpoint.

I suppose it's not completely wrong to say that ASCIIFoldingFilter is in this case used to fold \u00e6->ae and is thus required to be executed prior to the Scandinavian normalization. \n\nWhat possibly makes most sense it to not rely on ASCIIFoldingFilter at all. To make it a pure ScandinavianNormalizationFilter without \u00fc, \u00df and what not, that people would have to run a second pass through some ICU-filter in order to get that. ",
