    "description": "In a high commit rate environment (polling < 10s and commits every minute) the shutdown/restart of a slave can result in old temp directories laying around, filling up disk space as we go on. This happens with the following scenario:\n\n1. master has index version 2\n2. slave downloads files for version 2 to index.2 temp directory\n3. slave is shutdown\n4. master increments to version 3\n5. slave is started\n6. slave downloads files for version 3 to index.3 temp directory\n\nThe result is index.2 temp directory not getting deleted by any process. This is very annoying in such an environment where nodes are restarted frequently (for whatever reason). Working around the problem can be done by either manually deleting the temp directories between shutdown and startup or by calling the disablepoll command followed by an abortfetch command which will (after a long wait) finally purge the temp directory.\n\nSee this thread:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/solr-user@lucene.apache.org/msg45120.html",
