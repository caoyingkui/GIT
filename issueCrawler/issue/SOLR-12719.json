    "description": "The autoReplicaFailoverWaitAfterExpiration in solr.xml is used to populate the auto add replicas trigger's waitFor value. This was done to preserve back-compat in SOLR-10397. However, it has limitations as currently implemented e.g. SOLR-12114.\n\nWe should move it to either a cluster property or autoscaling property, deprecate the current setting and remove it in 8.0 (in another issue)",
