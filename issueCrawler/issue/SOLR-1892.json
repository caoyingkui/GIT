    "description": "we use a webcrawler written in perl to submit PDF and other rich text files to solr. we create a POST-request to the update/extract handler. we have a problem with setting fields via literal.FIELDNAME=foobar.\n\nin our schema.xml we have defined a field visiblePath as string, indexed false and stored true. when we now submit a PDF and set literal.visiblePath=test the field is not created in the solr index. the problem seems to be, that we can't set any string field in this way. strange thing: we have also defined several string fields that have an underscore at the beginning, like '__intern', '_dokumententyp', this fields can be set. also literal.id works.",
