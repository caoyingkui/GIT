    "description": "Using the final release lucene1.2.jar, if I perform a search using multiple \nindexes and a wildcard search term, the list of search results may vary \naccording to the order of the physical index folders supplied.\n\nLucene expands a wildcard term by refering to the indexed terms contained in \nthe first index in the list. It then uses this expanded query for all \nsubsequent searches on all of the indexes. Therefore, if the first index \ncontains a subset of terms from other indexes, the search will fail to match \nsome terms from the second and subsequent indexes.\n\nIf the order of specified indexes is then changed, the number of resultant hits \nusing the same search term will also change.",
