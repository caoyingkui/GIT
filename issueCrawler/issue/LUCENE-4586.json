    "description": "Today the default ResultMode is GLOBAL_FLAT, but it should be PER_NODE_IN_TREE. ResultMode is being used whenever you set the depth of FacetRequest to greater than 1. The difference between the two is:\n\n\n\tPER_NODE_IN_TREE would then compute the top-K categories recursively, for every top category at every level (up to depth). The results are returned in a tree structure as well. For instance:\n\n\n\n\nDate\n  2010\n    March\n    February\n  2011\n    April\n    May\n\n\n\n\n\tGLOBAL_FLAT computes the top categories among all the nodes up to depth, and returns a flat list of categories.\n\n\n\nGLOBAL_FLAT is faster to compute than PER_NODE_IN_TREE (it just computes top-K among N total categories), however I think that it's less intuitive, and therefore should not be used as a default. In fact, I think this is kind of an expert usage.",

That uncovered a potential bug in TopKInEachNodeHandler where it didn't resolve ties on facet values by ordinal \u2013 this lead to inconsistent ordering of facet results (discovered by SamplingWrapperTest).\n\nI had to fix some tests that relied on GLOBAL_FLAT mode for results verification (it's easier to verify results in that mode).\n\nAdded a CHANGES entry under back-compat changes.\n\nAll tests pass (tried many iterations).
