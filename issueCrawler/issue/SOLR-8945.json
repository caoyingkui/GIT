    "description": "While indexing from a database, solr automatically created some id fields as `tlong`. These fields could either contain a number or a message like 'Not Available' if that particular id/number was not present.\nIn such a case, solr threw an error similar to:\n\nERROR: [doc=People-139728] Error adding field 'Office_PhoneNo'='603 103' msg=For input string: \"603 103\"\n\nIn such a case, the intuitive thing would be to throw a NumberFormatException so that the user can easily figure out that a number field is receiving non-numeric values.",

It's just less readble is all.\nSo, I think that you should close this issue. ",
