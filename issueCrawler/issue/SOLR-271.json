    "description": "I clicked \"commit\" on the admin console after inserting a large number of documents from a separate client program.  The commit ran for about 8 minutes and eventually failed because the JVM threw an OutOfMemoryError.  The admin console then displayed \"SUCCESS! java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at org.apache.lucene.index.TermBuffer.toTerm(TermBuffer.java:104) at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentTermEnum.term(SegmentTermEnum.java:155) ...\" (Java stack dump).  I think it also said \"status=1\" which is an error status but I don't see that in the output now.  \n\nCertainly the gui should not claim \"SUCCESS!\" unless the commit was actually successful.  In case of failure it would also help to to show a message giving some indication of the current state of things, i.e. I'm wondering if the failed commit might have left my index in some messed up state so I have to rebuild it.",
