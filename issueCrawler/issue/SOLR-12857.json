Accessing the API directly is working for the user.\n\nFired up the dih example on 7.5.0, checked it.  Everything looked good, so I thought I would check multiple browsers.  All is good in current versions of Firefox Developer Edition, Chrome, and Edge.  But in Internet Explorer (version 11 on Windows 10), it says \"Last Update: unknown\".",
