    "description": "I've hit this while debugging a test, and was able to reproduce with a simple testcase. StandardDirectoryReader.open (nrt) calls IOUtils.close() on hitting an exception from RLD.getReadOnlyClone. But this is wrong, since if two attempts are made to obtain an NRT reader, and both of them fail, the readers that were closed on the first time are no longer closed, since their \"closed\" member is true. It should instead decRef() them. I'll upload a testcase and fix shortly.",

I've fixed StandardDirectoryReader.open to decRef the readers on exceptions as well as simplified the method to not save the prior exception that was hit since since we now only decRef() and we're guaranteed that this decRef won't attempt to close the reader since it's obtained from ReaderAndLiveDocs.\n\nI think it's ready, but I'll wait for the policemen.
