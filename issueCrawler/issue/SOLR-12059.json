From a legal perspective, the trademarks are BIG part of the power the foundation has to enforce its goals.  The foundation can't prevent anyone from removing the trademarks, and I wouldn't want to even if we did have that power, but I don't think we should spend any time helping. ",

It is also present in some of the metadata contained in jar files.\n\nI looked at a logfile where all that was done was starting Solr up, adding an index, and stopping.  It contained MANY mentions of Solr, and a large number of them would require source code changes to remove.\n\nSuch a change would require an incredible time investment.  Even if you set up a script to do the change and re-compile, it is likely that this script would require a few hours of additional work whenever a new version is released.\n\nAnd as I mentioned on the mailing list before, even if you're successful in changing EVERYTHING, if your customer's staff knows anything about Solr, they're going to figure it out as soon as they look at the admin UI or one of the requests or responses.  There are a number of identifiers that Solr includes which are very unique to Solr, but do not actually say \"Solr\" anywhere.  If they google any of those names, they're going to see a lot of hits about Solr.  As an example:  Try googling \"edismax\".\n\nWe haven't explicitly TRIED to make it impossible to remove the trademark, but development has naturally and organically grown up around the trademark, to the point that it is extremely difficult to remove.

It has been about replacing \"solr\" with something else, which was stated as \"my\" in everything I have seen before today.\n\nWhy would you need to rename solr-cell-6.5.1.jar to my-cell-6.5.1.jar if your intent is version control?  There's already a version number in the filename, and the jars are very unlikely to ever get replaced with an incorrect version, because another version will most likely have a different filename.\n\nI have the same question about renaming solr-webapp to my-webapp and solr-jetty-context.xml to my-jetty-context.xml, which were other changes you said you wanted to make.  These changes are unlikely to be related to version control.  The context file almost never requires changes, and the other one is a directory.  Most users will NEVER need to change the context file, so the official Solr download serves as a backup copy that can always be obtained.\n\nRenaming solrconfig.xml to myconfig.xml also seems to have little to do with version control.\n\nIf my suspicions are unfounded and you really are interested in version control, there are two ways to do this effectively with Solr's config files.  Neither of these methods requires any ability to change the filenames Solr is expecting to see.\n\nOne way is to put the entire directory into version control, setting the software to ignore anything that's not needed to make sure you don't lose config info.  This would probably mean something like svn or git.  When you make a change, you can commit it, which will ensure that the version history isn't lost.  You could even have changes pushed to a central repository, so that if the Solr server loses all of its data, you still have all of your config information.\n\nThe other way is to copy the active config file to a versioned backup whenever you change it.  So for solr.xml, you will have a bunch of other files, with names like solr-201803101900.xml ... and there would be similar backups for other config files.  Solr will typically ignore the ones with different filenames.  To make sure you don't lose this data if the Solr server dies completely, copy the files regularly to another server.\n\nWith SolrCloud, where the active configs are in zookeeper, you would want to maintain a separate on-disk config tree somewhere and do version control on that, uploading changes to ZK after making changes in the on-disk directory and doing whatever's necessary to keep your version history.\n\nIf you really feel like you need to rename solr.xml, then edit the source code, change it, and recompile Solr.  I haven't seen a compelling reason to make it configurable for everyone.  It certainly COULD be configurable, but there are always risks of bugs when something is made configurable.  Because of that, configurability is only added to things where there is a REALLY good reason.\n\nThinking about it from the standpoint of supporting users, it is very nice to be able to mention the solr.xml filename and be SURE that this is the file the user needs to look for.
