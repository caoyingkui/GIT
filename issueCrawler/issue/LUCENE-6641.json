            "content": "My assumption that something was wrong is because the class in SolrJ I have been working with is not following the standard, hence my confusion\n\nWhat's vital is that we do have a standard.\n\nIt's much less important that we perfectly enforce it 100% of the time \n\nIt's just like in the U.S., how we have laws created over time by our legislative branch, but then separately \"enforced\" by the judicial branch and sometimes scary police forces.  So in Lucene we have a strong legislative branch but a weak police force.\n\nStill, this way, if ever there is a disagreement on code styling, we can immediately fall back on our \"law\" to quickly resolve it.  If we were law-less, we would (trust me, I've seen it!) have awesomely huge disagreements over where a space or a { goes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law_of_triviality) and never actually make progress building search engines.\n\nSo, yes, much of our code currently \"violates\" the law, but that's relatively minor problem "
