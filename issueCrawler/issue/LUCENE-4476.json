This is really not\na problem except when you dont expect it and people are looking over your shoulder,\nthen it can be a HUGE hassle.\n\none minor thing i ran into was that line 1381 redirects output so if it fails you dont know why... this happens e.g. if the\ndirectory is typoed or something.\n\n\n-Dmaven.dist.dir=~/rc2/lucene\n\nBuildfile: /home/rmuir/workspace/lucene-trunk/lucene/build.xml\n\nclean:\n\nstage-maven-artifacts:\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/home/rmuir/workspace/lucene-trunk/lucene/common-build.xml:1381: exec returned: 2\n\nTotal time: 0 seconds\n\n\n\nI know its redirecting output, just didnt know if there was some simple way instead of\nfailOnError=true if we could instead fail on a property with the captured output?

I never use cygwin for builfding on windows, why do you Steven? To run ANT and build artifacts a plain cmd.exe is fine.\n\nI agree, Uwe - password hiding with Ant's secure input handler works on Win7 cmd window for me too.  Definitely a cygwin-specific issue.\n\nI use bash under an Xterm, because I feel like it  - it's the maximally Unix-ish experience on Windows.  Also, when mixing native binaries and Cygwin binaries, it's easier to use Cygwin tools to keep everybody happy from bash.exe, rather than from cmd.exe.  Also, the Xterm window is resizeable (win console has a fixed width) and is more customizable.\n\n\nAh, also: if you run bash.exe in the official Windows console windows (not cygwin's own), it also works.
