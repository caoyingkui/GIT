See:\nhttps://lucidworks.com/blog/2015/09/10/minmax-on-multivalued-field/\n\nI'd strongly recommend you try getting the basic query to work outside of aggregation so you get the syntax right then try the aggregation route. If you still have problems, please ping the user's list. ",

I have already using those logic.\n\nBut, I am more curious why it is not supporting by  \"Solr's Parallel SQL  aggmode=map_reduce\".\n\nanyway, as per your response I will post my questions in user's list.\n\nThank you.
