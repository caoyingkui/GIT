Also filed SOLR-9377 to track fixing [subquery] ... both of those are going to be tricky, and i don't want the rest of these tests to be held up waiting for a fix.\n\nThis updated patch cleans up all the nocommits, adds coverage for [shard] testing (which i thought i already had, but evidently not) and punts on the issue of testing [child] \u2013 i just don't see any straight forward way of incorporating testing of that into this class w/o some serious changes to how the randomized updates happen, so i've filed SOLR-9379 to look into that further.\n\n\u2014\n\nI think this patch is good to go as is.
