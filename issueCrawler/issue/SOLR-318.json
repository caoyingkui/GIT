    "description": "http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/solr/trunk/example/solr/conf/schema.xml  just after <fields> has a list of \"Valid attributes for fields\", although required is not mentioned there.  default is explained in a later example.  Perhaps that explanation should be moved to the list instead of next to it's first usage so it's more consistent.  i.e.\n\n   <!-- Valid attributes for fields:\n     name: mandatory - the name for the field\n     type: mandatory - the name of a previously defined type from the <types> section\n     indexed: true if this field should be indexed (searchable or sortable)\n     stored: true if this field should be retrievable\n     required: <ADD SOME DESCRIPTION HERE>\n     compressed: [false] if this field should be stored using gzip compression\n       (this will only apply if the field type is compressable; among\n       the standard field types, only TextField and StrField are)\n     multiValued: true if this field may contain multiple values per document\n     omitNorms: (expert) set to true to omit the norms associated with\n       this field (this disables length normalization and index-time\n       boosting for the field, and saves some memory).  Only full-text\n       fields or fields that need an index-time boost need norms.\n     termVectors: [false] set to true to store the term vector for a given field.\n       When using MoreLikeThis, fields used for similarity should be stored for \n       best performance.\n     default: \"default\" values can be specified for fields, indicating which\n        value should be used if no value is specified when adding a document.\n   -->",
