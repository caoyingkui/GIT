    "description": "When blob values are returned through a java ResultSet Object they have the type byte[]. \nAs byte[] doesn't have a useful toString method we end up with a reference type value added to the solr document (i.e. [B@1f23c5). \nThe problem is easy to remedy by adding the attribute 'convertType=\"true\"' to the dataSource tag within data-config.xml.\nHowever this attribute does not appear to be documented anywhere and I was only able to find it after a few hours digging through the source code. \nA simple fix for this would be to change the default value of convertType to true within the JdbcDataSource class.",
