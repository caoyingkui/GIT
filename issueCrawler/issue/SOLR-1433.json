This is actually very helpful for people who use Solrj with ant since its dependencies are mixed with core dependencies in the lib directory.\n\nHowever for something like clustering it does not make much sense because ./dist/solr-clustering-lib/ does not contain all the jars (there are other jars which we cannot distribute). Velocity contrib and DIH extras do not make such copies.\n\nWe could do one the following:\n\n\tRemove dist/solr-cell-lib, dist/solr-clustering-lib and let users copy dependencies from the respective contrib's lib directory. Keep dist/solrj-lib around though.\n\tMove these jars from respective contrib/lib and keep them in lib/<contrib-name>. Modify build classpaths in contrib builds to point to these new directories.\n\n "
