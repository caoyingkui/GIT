    "description": "http://markmail.org/message/bgplt2qdxc7gqga5\n\nBackground: the JSON Facet API does not execute sub-facets for a facet\nbucket with a 0 count (and the root facet bucket is like any other\nfacet bucket).\nThis was to help prevent the combinatorial explosion of deeply nested\nsub-facets with useless information.\n\nThis is obviously incorrect though, when a sub-facet does something\nthat can expand the domain rather than just restrict it.  Facet\nexclusions are one of these cases.\nFor zero facet buckets, we should check if any sub-facets have these\nproperties and then recurse if so.\n\nAside: not processing empty sets also helped with issues like what junk values to fill in for statistics... min, max, average, std, etc.  JSON doesn't even officially support NaN, so it's nice to be able to leave these junk values out in many circumstances.",
