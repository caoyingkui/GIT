IMO this isn't a good use of the DocumentObjectBinder which I think should be deliberately limited to field value retrieval.  \n\nNevertheless it's plausible to imagine some a highlighting \"DocumentTransformer\" feature that would allow the existing DOB to support fl=highlight_fieldA:highlight(fieldA) which would be useful for various use cases and sometimes more convenient for folks.
