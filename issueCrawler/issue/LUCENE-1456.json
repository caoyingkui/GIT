I am guessing its meant to be other.omitTf like the norms code above it.",

            "content": "Good eyes Mark! \n\nI was wondering why this didn't result in any unit test failures and it turns out that the only method that calls FieldInfo#update(FieldInfo) is this one in FieldInfos:\n\n  synchronized public FieldInfo add(FieldInfo fieldInfo) {\n    FieldInfo fi = fieldInfo(fieldInfo.name);\n    if (fi == null) {\n      return addInternal(fieldInfo.name, fieldInfo.isIndexed, fieldInfo.storeTermVector,\n                         fieldInfo.storePositionWithTermVector, fieldInfo.storeOffsetWithTermVector,\n                         fieldInfo.omitNorms, fieldInfo.storePayloads, fieldInfo.omitTf);\n    } else {\n      fi.update(fieldInfo);\n    }\n    return fi;\n  }\n\n\n\nHowever, nowhere in Lucene's core is this add(FieldInfo) method called. Also all contrib modules build successfully if I remove this method. Does anybody know why we have the method in the core? It seems like we can just remove it? ",
