I although need to do fuzzy search and/or approximate search when searching on this Term.\n\nHow can I achieve this purpose ?\n\nBest regards.",

This kind of question should be asked on the user list (http://lucene.apache.org/core/discussion.html#java-user-list-java-userlucene) before filling a JIRA issue. ",
