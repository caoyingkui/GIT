So even if you'd just be interested in full imports, you'll run into an exception at the end of your full import when solr attempts to write the timestamp into dataimport.properties. \n\nHowever, if that's not the case (i.e. a non-writable dataimport.properties does not break a full import), i'd suggest that the check if dataimport.properties is writable should only be done if a delta-query is defined, and in this case it should refuse to start the import.
