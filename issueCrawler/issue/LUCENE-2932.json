    "description": "When searching for information on 'lucene indexing speed' I get back some really out of date stuff:\n1. on the features page it proudly proclaims 20MB/minute, on some really old hardware. I think we should\nchange this to 95GB/hour: http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2010/09/lucenes-indexing-is-fast.html\n2. there are ancient benchmarks results from versioned data we link to the website. We list versioned\nwebsites for ancient versions going back to 1.4.3. Also i noticed when just casually googling for\nAPI documentation I tend to get results going to these ancient versions. I think we should remove\nstuff for all versions prior to 2.9",
