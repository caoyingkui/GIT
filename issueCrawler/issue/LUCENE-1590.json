    "description": "During updating my internal components to the new TrieAPI, I have seen the following:\n\nI index a lot of numeric fields with trie encoding omitting norms and term frequency. This works great. Luke shows that both is omitted.\n\nAs I sometimes also want to have the components of the field stored and want to use the same field name for it. So I add additionally the field again to the document, but stored only (as the Field c'tor using a TokenStream cannot additionally store the field). As it is stored only, I thought, that I can left out explicit setting of omitNorms and omitTermFreqAndPositions. After adding the stored-only-without-omits field, Luke shows all fields with norms enabled. I am not sure, if the norms/tf were really added to the index, but Luke shows a value for the norms and FieldInfo has it enabled.\n\nIn my opinion, this is not intuitive, o.a.l.document.Field  should switch both omit* options on when storing fields only (and also disable other indexing-only options). Alternatively the internal FieldInfo.update(boolean isIndexed, boolean storeTermVector, boolean storePositionWithTermVector, boolean storeOffsetWithTermVector, boolean omitNorms, boolean storePayloads, boolean omitTermFreqAndPositions) should only change the omit* and other options, if the isIndexed parameter (not this.isIndexed) is also true, elsewhere leave it as it is.\n\nIn principle, when adding a stored-only field, any indexing-specific options should not be changed in FieldInfo. If the field was indexed with norms before, norms should stay enabled (but this would be the default as it is).",

For all merging that results in an OR operation (all excl. omitNorms) the c'tors default is false, for all flags that merge with AND (omitNorms), the c'tors default is true.\n\nThe problem is: Luke does not show the omitTf thing, as this flag seems not be loaded by IndexReader, so I cannot find out if the omitTf was really done in index (Luke does not show this flag even for fields that were added once with omitTf).\n\nFinally, I wanted to add a test, that exactly does what I have done, and tests if it works.

As soon as a field is added that is indexed and has not explicitely set omitNorms, norms are enabled again (as noted in the FieldInfo.update() method). So everything behaves correctly, only the display is now correct in Luke. ",

I plan to commit in a day or two.\n\nIt's a good catch, all the places in FieldsReader where we fail to\ncarryover OTFAP from FieldInfo --> Field instance on the document.\nIt's yet another example of how having the loaded Document \"seem like\"\nthe indexed document causes problems.\n\nIn the ideal future (I think?), the fields on a \"loaded\" Document\nwould make no effort to convey these index-time options like\nomitNorms, OTFAP, etc., because those settings are \"semi-global\"\n(absorbed into the FieldInfos for the current segment).  And something\nlike boost, which the API lets you access on a loaded doc, is always\nwrong since we cannot recreate that (it's not stored, directly, in the\nindex).\n\nAt indexing time, all these if's all over the place to conditionalize\nthe defaults depending on whether the field is indexed, are also\nspooky.  It's as if we should have a separate class (IndexedField)\nthat privately carries these values.  Then a StoredField wouldn't even\nhave them.  But that approach breaks down because we'd also want an\nIndexedAndStoredField.\n\nOr... perhaps we move all the indexing-specific settings out of\nField.java and into Field.Index.  After all, these details really\ndescribe tweaks on how Lucene will do its indexing, so they don't\nreally belong in the main Field.java class. ",

The original bug was fixed in a few lines (FieldInfo ctor and update()).\n\n\nIt's a good catch, all the places in FieldsReader where we fail to\ncarryover OTFAP from FieldInfo --> Field instance on the document.\nIt's yet another example of how having the loaded Document \"seem like\"\nthe indexed document causes problems.\n\nI am still not happy with the new FieldReader because it cannot replicate all indexing infos (but now does almost everything). I know, it does not affect functionality (as only the stored contents can be retrieved). In principle the Field instances should have no indexing options. Luke would the display nothing anymore, but for this case it would really be better to make the Field infos \"public\", so somebody could enumerate all fields and test then, which options were used during indexing. Mixing this with retrieval of stored fields is not good.\n\nOne case is now not implemented correctly in FieldsReader: A binary stored field have a special if-clause in FieldsReader. The binary field is loaded as stored only, currently only omitTf and omitNorms are set (I added this). But e.g. INDEX is always false and so on. In principle for completeness, all options from FieldInfo should be replicated here.\nFieldsReader would be better to have a central method like copyFieldOptions(FieldInfo, Fieldable), that copies all options from FieldInfo to the Fieldable (without looking at the stored contents). The other if-cases should only initialize the stored parts and type. I think, I give it a try.\nThe whole info is now more important: If somebody in the past had stored the string contents compressed, he must now use a binary field and compress himself. In this case, Luke would not display any indexing options anymore. This is not bad, but inconsistent.\n\nSo the better case is to make the Field properties public not on the document level, but on the IndexReader level. ",
