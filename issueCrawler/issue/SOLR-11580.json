    "description": "Normal solr behavior in distributed solr shards is to bring id and score on first request and then request full row of results and highlighted fields in the second call after sorting the results (on aggregator node). In Solr 6 or earlier a change was introduced to skip the second call if fields to return only has id and score. However, this misses one edge case when hl=true; and asks the shards to highlight all the results on the first call, which is really inefficient.",
