LIkewise, many classes have a \"getDefaultStopSet()\" which makes these methods (when called by client code) suffer from the same API back-compat issues that the Analyzers themselves did before we added Version.",

The simplest convention moving forward would probably be to name the file after the first Lucene version it was added in (ie: \"russian_stop_3_3.txt\") but there is no reason why the names have to directly corrispond to the Lucene Version \u2013 they could just as easily have completely sequential names (ie: \"russian_stop_001.txt\" or \"russian_stop_AAA.txt\").\n\n\n\n\n\tAll of the static \"getDefaultStopSet()\" methods in all of the various Analyzers should be changed to take in a Version param which picks the appropriate file (or staticly compiled set) based on the param.  Any Analyzer that already has Version based stopword switching logic in it's constructor should instead just delegate to the getDefaultStopSet() method.\n\n\n ",

Specificly: we should never modify the contents of the files, we should just add a new file and \"deprecate\" the old file.\n\nbut the naming convention could easily be...\n\nstopwords_esperanto.txt\nstopwords_esperanto_2.txt\nstopwords_esperanto_3.txt\n...\n ",
