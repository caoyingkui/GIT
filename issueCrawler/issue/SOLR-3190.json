    "description": "I'm working on a couple of SolrEntityProcessor improvements:\n\n1) ability to provide a specific HttpClient instance to make authentication, https connections and so on.\n2) introduce consistency between solr parameters and parameters used from SolrEntityProcessor to query Solr: better rename fields to fl and format to wt while we can (the processor has not been released yet). Better use CommonParams constants instead of new ones with same content.",

            "content": "Attached patch. Added overridable getHttpClient method which allows subclasses to provide their own HttpClient instance easily.\nRenamed fields to fl and format to wt, used CommonParams.\nIf you guys agree with these changes I'll update the wiki once this will be committed.\nBy the way, if someone has some SolrEntityProcessor improvement to propose, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.
