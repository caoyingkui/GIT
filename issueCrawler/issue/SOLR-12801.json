BadApple=true is the default, you have to deliberately disable those tests. Of course if you do in your environment, then the above is totally true.\n\nWhat is also totally true is that the noise is such that I can break something and never see it because I haven't waded through each and every failure in BadApple'd tests to see if I introduced a legitimate failure in one of them.\n\nI would be thrilled if all the BadApple nonsense were no longer useful. As it is, what it's mainly recording is whether we're annotating more than we un-annotate as well as whether tests come and go over longer time frames. There are tests that fail for 4 weeks in a row, then succeed for 5 weeks, then fail for 6 weeks etc. That's the purpose of leaving the comments in when tests were annotated/unannotated.\n\nThe BadApple thrashing is not doing much of anything towards actually fixing the issues.\u00a0About all it's doing is making the extent of the problem more visible if anyone bothers to read the weekly e-mails.\n\nI guess the net-net here is that I don't like the BadApple process much\u00a0and would be glad to stop dealing with it altogether if we define a better process.\n\nSounds like a hot topic at Activate  ",

Many tests could be either-or \u2013 the test doesn't fundamentally care either way.  With some adjustments in that issue, they could be written that way.  I did this for a specific client but it could have been upstreamed to Solr.\n\nAnother FYI that I think is hugely important to test maintenance is SOLR-10229 concerning preventing proliferation of one-off test files.

Where you changed the collection count from 3 to 4 the test was explicitly testing that a new collection was not yet visible. The test expects that it won't be visible until after we wait for it to appear, which generally safe since collection creation typically takes 1-2 seconds, and the\u00a0listing of aliases is typically very fast.\n\nAlso your change creates a serious bug wherein pre-emptive collection creation will always be triggered for every doc potentially preemptively creating\u00a0an indefinite number of collections, this bug masked the fact you changed later tests to higher than expected numbers and should have failed.\n\nI'm going to revert that commit to restore correct functionality, and add\u00a0additional assertions that need to pass.\n\nIf this test/technique seems to be a source of instability (the assumptions about timing could be bad under high load), then we'll need to find a solution that also passes the additional assertions ",
