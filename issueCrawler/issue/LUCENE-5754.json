    "description": "The current expressions modules only allows ASCII letters, ASCII digits and the underscore in variable names.\n\nIt is quite common to javascript developers to use also the dollar sign as identifier part (especially at the beginning of an identifier, see the famous \"jQuery\" $-function). This would allow bindings like \"$score\".\n\nThe official ECMAScript spec allows the $: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf (see section 7.6)\n\nThe other stuff there like unicode escapes and all unicode letter crazyness should be excluded for simplicity.\n\nAdding the \"$\" is just a one-line change in the grammar and does not conflict with anything else, because \"$\" is not a special character to javascript.",
