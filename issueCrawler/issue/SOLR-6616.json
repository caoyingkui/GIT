    "description": "From SOLR-5986:\n\nAs of now, when timeAllowed is set, we never get back an exception but just partialResults in the response header is set to true in case of a shard failure. This translates to shards.tolerant being ignored in that case.\nOn the code level, the TimeExceededException never reaches ShardHandler and so the Exception is never set (similarly for ExitingReaderException) and/or returned to the client.",

If the time elapses before the query response is complete, partial information may be returned.\n\nHowever, I think we should start returning the error and return partial results only when shards.tolerant is set to true.

            "content": "This patch only returns partialResults if shards.tolerant was true. It also adds some timeout checks during distributed processing to cancel pending tasks when timing out. This avoid components to keep sending shard requests (for facet pivot refinement for instance) even after timing out.\n\nWe may want to rename \"shards.tolerant\" to reflect the fact that it now also affects non-distributed requests. It should be specific to accepting partial results, no matter if it is distributed or not. ",
