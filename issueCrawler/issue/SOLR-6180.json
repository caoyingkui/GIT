    "description": "Consider the code in FieldResource.java:\n\nSchemaField newField = oldSchema.newField(fieldName, fieldType, map);\nIndexSchema newSchema = oldSchema.addField(newField, copyFieldNames);\nif (null != newSchema) {\n  getSolrCore().setLatestSchema(newSchema);\n  success = true;\n} else {\n  throw new SolrException(ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR, \"Failed to add field.\");\n}\n\n\n\nThe schema update lock is only held during the call to addField, so there is no guarantee that the schema we are setting later is actually the latest schema.  This would rarely happen, but it's possible that between the time we gave up the lock and the time we set the schema that we got a new schema from ZK.  We'd end up overwriting the new schema, possibly missing newly added fields.",

Even without that 10ms sleep (which we could perhaps randomly do?), I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't fail sometimes on the jenkins cluster, which is hammering these tests over and over as fast as it can in a variety of slow envs. "

When I ran the new test without the other patch I got a roughly 50% failure rate when I put a 50ms sleep between addField() and SolrCore.setLatestSchema() in FieldResource.put(), and 100% at 125ms.\n\nCommitting shortly.
