Implements a new mode -Ddata=web which fetches and posts a web page to Solr, and optionally pulls out links from it (using SolrCell extractOnly=true) and crawls to N levels.\n\nThis patch also implements recursion level support for files as well, plus optional delay.\n\nThis is not - as with post.jar in general - intended as a production feature, but as a nice way for newbies to test posting web pages to Solr without an external crawler, to increase the OOTB experience\u2122 "

If auto=yes the tool will try to set type\nand url automatically from file name. When posting rich documents\nthe file name will be propagated as \"resource.name\" and also used\nas \"literal.id\". You may override these or any other request parameter\nthrough the -Dparams property. To do a commit only, use \"-\" as argument.\nThe web mode is a simple crawler following links within domain, default delay=10s.\n\n "

Besides, we only use standard SDK functions, so it is still self-contained without extra deps, which is a major part of the Simple name. Besides, since much stuff is moved out from main() and into the class, it is also easier for folks to utilize this stuff from their own code should they wish. "
