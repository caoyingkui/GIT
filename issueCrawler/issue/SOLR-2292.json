    "description": "Over in SOLR-2288, rmuir made some good points about locking down the NamedList API to protect people...\n\n\nI looked at your patch, and personally I think NamedList should really be type-safe.\nIf users want to use it in a type-unsafe way, thats fine, but the container itself shouldn't be List<Object>.\n...\n\nSeparately, i just want to say the following about NamedList:\n\nAll uses of this API should really be reviewed. I'm quite aware that it warns you about the fact that its slow for certain operations,\nbut in my opinion these slow operations such as get(String, int) should be deprecated and removed.\n\nAny users that are using NamedList in this way, especially in loops, are very likely using the wrong datastructure.\n\n(emphasis added by me)",

I found another trap that I think is actually even worse!\n\nNamedList documents this limitation (the linear search by key) in this way:\n\n * If access by key is more important, see {@link SimpleOrderedMap},\n * or simply use a regular {@link Map}\n\n\n\nSo one might think SimpleOrderedMap wouldn't have these problems, especially from its documentation:\n\n<code>SimpleOrderedMap</code> is a {@link NamedList} where access by key is more\n * important than maintaining order when it comes to representing the\n * held data in other forms, as ResponseWriters normally do.\n\n\n\nYet SimpleOrderedMap only extends NamedList!!! Its still a linear search!\nSo we need to check uses of SimpleOrderedMap too, to look for n^2 bugs. "

In java API they are identical, but in json SimpleOrderedMap is \n{\"foo\":10,\"bar\":20}\n and NamedList shows [\"foo\",10,\"bar\",20]\n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/api/org/apache/solr/common/util/SimpleOrderedMap.html\n "
