It should instead use the newer DoubleValueSource or LongValueSource framework in Core.  As I write this, this appears to be the last part of Lucene to refer to the ValueSource framework, and I think we should then remove it \u2013 for another issue of course.",

The latter is certainly preferable to me but is of course a lot of work \u2013 not sure how much.\n\nRE facets module: if its tests only depend on the queries module then the build/dependencies should be modified as-such (or as Adrien suggested use FunctionScoreQuery.  And have its test switch to FunctionScoreQuery (thus away from ValueSource framework).  Right now the facets module artificially declares through its dependencies that a user needs the queries module when that's not true.  This ought to be another issue; sorry for distracting us here.
