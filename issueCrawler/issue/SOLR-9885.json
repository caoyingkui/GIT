Also inconvenient if using custom log rotation/management.\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/solr/bin/solr#L1464\n\nProposing an environment setting, something like SOLR_LOG_PRESTART_ROTATION (with default true), that makes the execution of the four lines configurable.",

Perhaps a better name would be SOLR_LOG_PRESTART_ROTATION or similar? ",
