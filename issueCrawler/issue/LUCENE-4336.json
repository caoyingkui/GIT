            "content": "Here the patch. The javacc task is a little bit complicated (needed some help from blogs,...) because javacc.jar does not contain the ant task. The task is shipped with ANT and ANT expects a attribute called \"javacchome\", that must point to the home folder of an extracted javacc distribution (although it only uses the JAR). <javacc/> looks inside this dir for bin/lib and inside this dir for a file named javacc.jar (without version).\nSo we cannot use ivy:cachepath and ivy:retrieve is too unflexible (it allows to setup directory layout, but filename always contains version).\nThe trick here is a \"handwritten\" resolve/rewrite:\n\n\tget ivy:cachefileset for javacc-5.0.jar artifact\n\tcreate a \"fake\" release folder in ${build.dir} and then copy the cachefileset into it with a <mergemapper to=\"javacc.jar\"/>.\n\tthe javacc.home dir is then located in ${build.dir} and nuked on ant clean.\n\n\n\nThis patch also cleans up javacc at all. We only use javacc in the queryparser module so I moved all ant logic there. I also removed some unused tasks and properties.\n\nI will commit soon. ",

I tested today and it works great.\n\nJust as an FYI (unrelated), i tried the new JavaCC option to make CharStream etc classes pkg-private,\nit works (tests pass) but creates broken javadocs links because the parsers then have public\nmembers/methods referring to pkg-private classes. So for now we cannot yet use it \n\nBut its much easier to regenerate now! ",
