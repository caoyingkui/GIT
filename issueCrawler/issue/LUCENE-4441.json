    "description": "Heya,\nI would like to be able to prefix and postfix phrases when extracted text is not a complete phrase.\n\nFor example, let's say I have a phrase like \n\n \n\"Here is my text\"\n\n \nand another like \n\n \n\"This is a very long text and I want that Lucene highlight it even if this content is very long.\"\n\n \n\nWhen highlighting \"text\", I get something like:\n\n \n\"Here is my <B>text</B>\"\n\"This is a very long <B>text</B> and I want that Lucene highlight\"\n\n\n\nWhat I would like to get back is:\n\n\n \n\"Here is my <B>text</B>\"\n\"This is a very long <B>text</B> and I want that Lucene highlight [...]\"\n\n \n\nAs you can see, the \" [...]\" is added at the end because we extracted content from the field and not all the field.\n\nSo, we can add some options to Highlighter (FastVectorHighlighter) as follow:\n\n\n  // Default values :\n  // preLine = null;\n  // postLine = null;\n  public final String[] getBestFragments( final FieldQuery fieldQuery, IndexReader reader, int docId,\n      String fieldName, int fragCharSize, int maxNumFragments,\n      FragListBuilder fragListBuilder, FragmentsBuilder fragmentsBuilder,\n      String[] preTags, String[] postTags, String preLine, String postLine, Encoder encoder ) throws IOException;\n\n\n\nI hope this is doable. :-/",
