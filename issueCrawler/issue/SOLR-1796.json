    "description": "Lucene 2.9.1 is out of course and in maven repos but the 2.9.1-dev as found in Solr's source control right now is not.  This is pretty frustrating and I can only expect it will be a recurring problem.  If Solr is going to use lucene -dev versions then I think Solr needs to put them in a repo somewhere.  Apache's snapshot repo would make the most sense.\n\nFYI the repo manager is now managed by Nexus at this URL: \nhttps://repository.apache.org/index.html#nexus-search;quick~lucene",
