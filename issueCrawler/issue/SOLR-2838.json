But if no id field is there and the parameter is likely \"hidden\" and therefore indiscernible for users, those users got undesirable warnings in the log:\n\n\nWARNING: Document *null* does not contain input field subject. Skipping this field.\n\n\n\nAs we can access IndexSchema in initParams(), why don't we use uniqueKey field as the default.",
