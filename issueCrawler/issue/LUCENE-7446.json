            "content": "I think Anshum's fix is wrong - we shouldn't be asking the backward compatibility question when we know that the version to be added is greater than the latest version on the branch - I think the exception as currently thrown should be kept as-is (more below).  I'm attaching a patch with an alternate fix.\n\naddVersion.py is used in three contexts:\n\n\n\tThe version to be added is greater than the latest on the branch - this happens on release branches, as well as on the stable and unstable branches after a release branch is copied from them.\n\tThe version to be added is less than the latest on the branch, and the latest version is backward compatible with the version to be added.\n\tThe version to be added is less than the latest on the branch, but the latest version is not backward compatible with the version to be added.\n\n\n\nAFAICT, Anshum and Shalin have run into problems with #1 (on release branches).  scriptutil.py's Version.is_back_compat_with() is designed to distinguish between cases #2 and #3, and throws an exception in case #1.  The boolean return value doesn't allow for encoding the third case (\"not applicable\"), so the exception should remain.\n\nSo I think the correct fix is to not ask the is-back-compat-with question if we know it's not applicable (i.e. case #1).  The attached patch does this.  I've successfully added 6.2.2 on branch_6_2 with the patch.\n\nI'll test all the other cases before I commit.\n\nFYI, Michael McCandless must have run into the same (or similar) problem a few weeks back and attempted a different fix on master and branch_6x (which won't work in case #1 on the unstable branch after a major release branch is cut): https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucene-solr.git;a=blobdiff;f=dev-tools/scripts/addVersion.py;h=e95a51f4181e6ee1fb1edc9da7233cf6c58aac23;hp=75a22e0c67b9d4c14735eb85971a88b693ea62ce;hb=37649598;hpb=213bc658922ea3fd63abc5e8188db9060176ec02 - I plan on reverting Mike's change when I commit the attached patch.
