This doesn't give problems in most operations (since I generally use\nincremental indexing to update the index), but when I try to create a full index\nthese files prevent the directory from being deleted.\nApparently lucene keeps a file open that has already been deleted in another\nthread. Perhaps this occurs during incremental indexing?",
