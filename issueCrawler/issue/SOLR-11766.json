    "description": "There are a very large number of streaming expressions and they need some special info design to be more easily accessible. The current way we're presenting them doesn't really work. This issue is to track ideas and POC patches for possible approaches.\n\nA couple of ideas I have, which may or may not all work together:\n\n\n\tProvide a way to filter the list of commands by expression type (would need to figure out the types)\n\tPresent the available expressions in smaller sections, similar in UX concept to https://redis.io/commands. On that page, I can see 9-12 commands above \"the fold\" on my laptop screen, as compared to today when I can see only 1 expression at a time & each expression probably takes more space than necessary. This idea would require figuring out where people go when they click a command to get more information.\n\t\n\t\tOne solution for where people go is to put all the commands back in one massive page, but this isn't really ideal\n\t\tAnother solution would be to have an individual .adoc file for each expression and present them all individually.\n\t\n\t\n\tSome of the Bootstrap.js options may help - collapsing panels or tabs, if properly designed, may make it easier to see an overview of available expressions and get more information if interested.\n\n\n\nI'll post more ideas as I come up with them.\n\nThese ideas focus on the HTML layout of expressions - ideally we come up with a solution for PDF that's better also, but we are much more limited in what we can do there.",

I'm a big fan of the Redis-inspired screenshot you attached above.  It's a big improvement on making these more compact.  A related but different approach would be to have the a small summary line for each Streaming Expression, that expands-on-click to show more details.  The default display for \"Swagger\" docs comes close to what I'm suggesting: http://petstore.swagger.io/#/.  It may be a bit more compact, but is otherwise very similar.  Not sure which people prefer aesthetically.  Just suggesting an alternative.\n\nAnd lastly, a more general question:\n\nideally we come up with a solution for PDF that's better also, but we are much more limited in what we can do there.\n\nThis is the second time (that I know of) where we've run into sticking points dealing with formatting in our PDF vs HTML ref-guide.  (SOLR-11584 being the other).  And I imagine these sorts of issues will continue to come up, as we try to find better, more helpful ways of presenting information to our users.  Do we see ourselves continuing to support both formats for the foreseeable future?  (I'm not questioning the utility of our PDF release format.  Just curious whether anyone else is worried that it'll start to restrict our flexibility sometime soon.  Maybe I should've posted this as a mailing list question instead of tacking it on here...) ",

We would need everyone who might be an RM to set themselves up to build the HTML, which requires a number of unique dependencies and some have had trouble with it in the past. The PDF has no external dependencies, so is simple for anyone to run.\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm forgetting a couple\u00a0of other reasons.\n\nI think, though, that even if we decided that the HTML version is the official format, some people would still want a PDF version (maybe just as a backup in case their networks is down), and we'd want to make sure that whatever we do with the content, those users would not lose anything because of the format.

I feel like the examples are getting lost in either option...I think it might need to be bold and/or another color.\n\t\tLayout of row 3 in the current example is weird because there's only 2 there - should straighten out when a 3rd expression is added to that row.\n\t\n\t\n\thttp://people.apache.org/~ctargett/StreamingExpressions/stream-evaluator-reference.html shows new layout of expression sections: Expression, basic example again, short description.

My first instinct when I saw them was that it may be time to think about putting the Streaming Expressions documentation in it's own guide rather then as part of the reference guide.\n\nHere are three reasons for doing this:\n\n1) Streaming Expressions tend to hold up the release of the main reference guide. If they we're in there own guide they could release later without causing other documentation to slip as well.\n\n2) Right now the Streaming Expression documentation is being wedged into an existing format. If we we're able to break it out this would free us up to find better ways to organize and display the information.\n\n3) Streaming Expression documentation is now so big that it probably deserves it's own guide. The docs include Parallel SQL, Graph, Stream Sources, Stream Decorators, Stream Evaluators and the Statistical programming syntax. With all the new functions and planned user guides the sheer number of pages makes it worthwhile to break out in it's own guide.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 ",

            "content": "An interesting idea, Joel, and I totally understand why you're going that way. A few counter-points, or maybe just additional things to consider.\n\nStreaming Expressions tend to hold up the release of the main reference guide.\n\nAt the risk of sounding flippant or disrespectful, there's a really easy way to solve that: do your doc updates at the same time you add a new expression. The \"wait until the RC has been cut then start doc updates\" approach is the only thing holding up merging the Ref Guide release with the main artifact release (and I'll add it is not in the slightest pleasant for me, the one who is nearly always the RM). Sure, one way around it is to release separately, but a more direct way is to just do them at the same time.\n\nbq, If they we're in there own guide they could release later\n\nAt some point we need to split up the Ref Guide - it's massive (1,200 pages in PDF) and grows more untenable with each release - but there are a number of factors to consider:\n\n\n\tUnless all the separate PDFs are released at the same time, they require VOTE threads for each release.\n\tEven if we changed to consider the HTML as the official format, we would still need a VOTE for each release. That means instead of going to a single release process for Lucene/Solr + Ref Guide, we'd still have at least 2 and possibly 3 or more release processes. The current Ref Guide release takes ~1 week of my time full-time every time - it's not a hit the button and walk away kind of thing if you want it done with any quality. IOW, since I'm the one doing it 99.9% of the time, I don't have time for more than a single release cycle no matter how many PDFs are generated.\n\tI've gone through the exercise in the past of splitting a single massive PDF into multiple separate PDFs, and one of the most hellish aspects of it was trying to handle links to sections that end up in different PDF files (like, I want to link to details about fields while describing the types of fields expressions would support). You can't. And since we have both an HTML and PDF format, links that work for the HTML version won't work for the PDF, so there would be additional issues to straighten out to make that work properly.\n\n\n\nRight now the Streaming Expression documentation is being wedged into an existing format\n\nI infer from this comment that you have ideas but think they may not possible. Beyond splitting the pages into sub-sections, I don't recall other ideas you've shared that were rejected due to format limitations...but perhaps I'm forgetting something?\n\nWe have two real limitations, IMO: 1) the fact that the official release artifact is the PDF, which is very book-like and does not support many  interactive features we may want to include; and 2) our imaginations and skills.\n\nRegarding the first limitation, some users want a PDF. We would still be asked to create one even if it was not the \"official\" format that we vote on. I don't see it going away entirely, so that limitation will always be around.\n\nFor the second - The HTML version is incredibly flexible. We can lay out those pages however we want. We can make the Streaming Expression pages look totally different than other pages by providing a layout template for them and telling each page to use it. We can add javascript this or that to do all kinds of fun things. But we need ideas first (I've shared those I've had), and then possibly someone with deeper skills than mine to make it happen.\n\nIf we do come up with some great ideas, we may need to do a couple of things to make the same info appear properly in the PDF, but nearly anything you can think of for online information design is within our grasp if we have a) the ideas and the ability to implement them, and b) the willingness to maintain it release-to-release as new expressions are added. It's not that hard to make things work properly in the PDF, you just need to be cognizant of the need for it.\n\nAt the very least, I think we should move Streaming Expressions out of the \"Searching\" section and make it a top-level section - the scope of what it can do is way beyond \"Searching\" now and it deserves it - I'll do that in the patch I'm working on with the other changes I've been making. But before we go ahead and make it a standalone Guide on its own, I'd like to hear your point of view on the other issues I've raised here. ",
