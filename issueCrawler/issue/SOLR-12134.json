    "description": "We've seen a couple problems come up recently where the ref-guide had broken links ot javadocs.\n\nIn some cases these are because people made typos in java classnames / pathnames while editing the docs - but in other cases the problems were that the docs were correct at one point, but then later the class was moved/renamed/removed, or had it's access level downgraded from public to private (after deprecation)\n\nI've worked up a patch with some ideas to help us catch these types of mistakes - and in general to hook the \"bare-bones HTML\" validation (which does not require jekyll or any non-ivy managed external dependencies) into ant precommit\n\nDetails to follow in comment/patch...",

If you also apply the \"nocommit.SOLR-12134.sample-failures.patch\" file you can see how some various examples of problems will affect things like cd solr/solr-ref-guide; ant vs cd solr; ant documentation (Of course: to test ant precommit you'll have to remove the 'nocommit' test from that patch, since it will cause precommit to fail fast before it even tries to build documentation)\n\n\u00a0\n\n(EDIT \u2013 based on an offline question from steve, i updated one comment in the examples above to clarify that ant documentation will actually build the pdf and validate the links by building & verifying the bare-bones html ... that's a preexisting dependency in build-pdf) ",
