    "description": "In LUCENE-6481, Nicholas Knize added methods to test for the relationship between an axis-aligned rect vs the query polygon, e.g. is the rect fully contained by the polygon, overlaps its boundaries, or fully outside the polygon.\n\nI think we should also use those methods to speed up BKDPointInPolygonQuery, to decide on recursively visiting the tree, how to handle the leaf blocks under internal nodes.",
