    "description": "After all of the recent discussions, seems like it only makes sense to leverage the ASF infra hardware & network. We ran into multiple issues during the release of 5.0 due to known reliability issues with people.apache.org.\n\nAs the INFRA issue that was created (INFRA-9170) to get that fixed was closed as \"won't fix\" with a reason that they don't support hosting releases on people.apache.org.\n\nImportant NOTE: This is related but orthogonal to reducing artifacts size or retrying downloads.",
