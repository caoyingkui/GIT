SegmentMerger now exports the docID map it used when\nmerging, and I use that to renumber the max docIDs of all pending\ndeletes.\n\nFinally, I turned off tracking of memory usage of pending deletes\nsince they now live beyond each flush.  Deletes are now only\nexplicitly flushed if you set maxBufferedDeleteTerms to something\nother than DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH.  Otherwise they are flushed at the\nstart of every merge.",

UpdateByQuery can be added, if there is a\nneed.\nGood question Ning!\n\nAs of LUCENE-1044, when autoCommit=true, IndexWriter only commits on\ncommitting a merge, not with every flush.\n\nHmmm ... but, there is actually the reverse problem now with my patch:\nan auto commit can actually commit deletes before the corresponding\nadded docs are committed (from updateDocument calls).  This is\nbecause, when we commit we only sync & commit the merged segments (not\nthe flushed segments).  Though, autoCommit=true is deprecated; once we\nremove that (in 3.0) this problem goes away.  I'll have to ponder how\nto fix that for now up until 3.0...it's tricky.  Maybe before 3.0\nwe'll just have to flush all deletes whenever we flush a new\nsegment....\n\nAlso, I don't think we need updateByQuery?  Eg in 3.0 when autoCommit\nis hardwired to false then you can deleteDocuments(Query) and then\naddDocument(...) and it will be atomic.\n\n\nBecause of renumbering, we don't have to flush deletes at the start of\nevery merge, right?\n\nExactly.  EG, we could carry the deletes indefinitely and then flush\nthem only on close (assuming autoCommit=false), but...\n\n\nBut it is a good time to flush deletes.\n\nRight.  I think you want to flush all deletes that apply to the\nsegments being merged so merging will compact them.  Right now I apply\nall buffered deletes to all segments when any merge is started.  It\nmay be possible to only apply them to those segments about to be\nmerged, but, I think it gets rather complex to track which buffered\ndeletes then need to apply to which segments. ",

The latter, right?\n\n> Also, I don't think we need updateByQuery?

When autoCommit is disabled, we don't need any update method. ",
