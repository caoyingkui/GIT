I think a better solution is allowing for direct instantiation while providing a factory class if for some reason you need that behavior. Most apps I have worked with do not need it and I don't understand why its forced on you, other than a bit of overprotection. ",

If an instance already exists, then it's returned.  If all the instances are closed, the desired implementation can be returned.
