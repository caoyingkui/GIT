    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-6766.\n\nWe used to have a SortingMergePolicy to configure index time sorting, but with LUCENE-6766 you now set this on IndexWriterConfig.\n\nSolr had exposed index time sorting, so to preserve back-compat, I kept SortingMergePolicy alive, moved to solr's sources, but use it simply as a holder to pull the index sort from and pass to IWC.\n\nThis preserves back compat, but I think it'd be cleaner going forward to just allow index sort to be specified somewhere in solrconfig.xml wherever other index writer settings are set?",
