    "description": "I discussed this possible improvement with Stefan Pohl and Andrzej Bia\u0142ecki at Berlin Buzzwords: By having preset dictionaries (which could be user-provided and/or computed on a per-block basis), decompression could be faster since we would never have to decompress several documents from a block in order to access a single document.\n\nOne drawback is that it would require putting some boundaries in the compressed stream, so it would maybe decrease a little the compression ratio. But then if decompression is faster, we could also afford larger blocks, so I think this is worth exploring.",
