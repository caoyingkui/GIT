In fact, if you scan the HTML and make it more XML compliant, I don't mind helping you get it committed.\n\nthis is starting to sound like a \"not my problem\"\n\nThat's not true (nor a fair statement). This is an HTML document and it needs to be HTML compliant. Web browsers display it properly and therefore we think that this is not a bug in the file.\n\nAlso, even if we fix the current issues (is it just that single <br> tag? I doubt it ...), I'm not sure that future changes to the file will keep it XML-compliant, since I (we) usually 'test' these files by viewing them in a web browser, and not eclipse. ",

The problem is that the DOCTYPE as specified by the DTD in the file says it is supposed to be xhtml, but all the rest of the javadocs say that they are supposed to be \"loose.\" So, I put changed the dtd at the top of the userguide file and now it works just fine.\n\nSet the first line of userguide.html to:\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\n\nSo, I'm happy to try and figure out how to edit the source.
