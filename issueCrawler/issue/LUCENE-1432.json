Until yesterday when we started noticing the following stacktrace:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.util.BitSet cannot be cast to org.apache.lucene.search.DocIdSet\n        org.apache.lucene.search.CachingWrapperFilter.getDocIdSet(CachingWrapperFilter.java:76)\n        org.apache.lucene.misc.ChainedFilter.getDocIdSet(ChainedFilter.java:200)\n        org.apache.lucene.misc.ChainedFilter.getDocIdSet(ChainedFilter.java:145)\n        org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:140)\n        org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:112)\n        org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:136)\n\nOur index is 15gb in size and was made with Lucene 2.4.0.\nThe index holds around 36 million (Lucene) documents and 268 million terms.",
