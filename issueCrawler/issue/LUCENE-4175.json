But it contains a lot of code pertaining to an area overlap similarity as a ValueSource (very cool stuff) but that isn't tested at all, and that's my only concern.  If we want to be cautious about avoiding releasing untested code, then I suggest back-porting BBoxStrategy to 4x (pretty easy) but not the AreaSimilarity class.  The reference to it in BBoxStrategy is the method makeBBoxAreaSimilarityValueSource() which can be commented out in 4x.\n\nSound good? ",
