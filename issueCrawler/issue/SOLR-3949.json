    "description": "Suppose I boost the query terms and give different weights to different words e.g \"TV repair\" can be converted TV repair^0.001. When query INFO is printed (by org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore execute), it does not print q=TV repair^0.001. This causes confusion whether boost factor is applied or not.",
