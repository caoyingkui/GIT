We can either:\n\n\tspecialise to ToParentBlockJoinCollector (ok it seems dead already LUCENE-6959), though ParentChildrenBlockJoinQuery might be just a good engine for SOLR-10144\n\tit's probably done like queries macro generator, but I'm afraid it won't be fast for {!join}\n\tor probably just run separate queries in parallel.\n\n\n\nPlease share, ideas, opinions and usecases.",
