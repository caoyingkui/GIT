            "content": "Patch against trunk adding ResourceLoaderAware inform'ing to every place that does SchemaAware inform'ing, including in IndexSchema.readSchema().   I had to move informResourceLoaderAwareObjectsInChain() and informResourceLoaderAwareObjectsForFieldType() from ManagedIndexSchema to IndexSchema so that they are accessible from IndexSchema.readSchema().\n\nAfter I fixed the code, the data triggered a schemaless issue: there is a document (not the first!) in example/exampledocs/ipod_other.xml with an integral value for the weight field.  In standalone mode, this isn't an issue because docs are processed sequentially, but in cloud mode, some docs can be indexed on non-coordinator nodes, resulting in out-of-order schema modifications.  I ran into just that, with errors like the following in the solr.log:\n\n\nERROR - 2015-04-09 00:06:55.371; org.apache.solr.common.SolrException; org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: ERROR\n: [doc=F8V7067-APL-KIT] Error adding field 'weight'='4.0' msg=For input string: \"4.0\"\n[...]\nCaused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"4.0\"\n        at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)\n        at java.lang.Long.parseLong(Long.java:441)\n\n\n\nSo this patch also modifies example/exampledocs/ipod_other.xml to convert the one integral weight field value into a float. \n\nI tested the patch manually against trunk and lucene_solr_5_1 using the repro instructions in the description, both succeeded.
