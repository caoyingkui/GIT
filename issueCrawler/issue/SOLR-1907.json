    "description": "There is a URI scheme for addressing Solr via HTTP, but there is no URI scheme available for addressing Solr via embedded. If such a URI scheme existed, it would be easy to code apps that take either URI scheme as configuration parameter.\n\nHere are two concrete use cases:\n\n\tSOLR-1499 calls out to a Solr from another Solr, based on an HTTP URL.\n\t\n\t\tIt cannot easily refer to the same Solr via the embedded interface.\n\t\n\t\n\tDistributedSearch addresses other Solr instances, and it does not allow directly searching other cores in the same Solr via the direct interface.",

(We could also use solr:// for the default core. This may be legal, but it is confusing and solr://?parameter=value will be error-prone.)\n\tAdd a factory for SolrServer.\n\tRecode many unit tests as appropriate\n\n\n\nSeparately, update the wiki.
