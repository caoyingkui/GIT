If I hand-test it, it works (eg. it creates the core in correct location) if coreRootDirectory property has no trailing slash in solr.xml. "

            "content": "All of the test failures in TestSolrXml are some form like:\nassertEquals(\"core root dir\", \"testCoreRootDirectory\", cfg.getCoreRootDirectory());\n\nAnd can be fixed by adding the trailing slash to the hard-coded string like this:\nassertEquals(\"core root dir\", \"testCoreRootDirectory/\", cfg.getCoreRootDirectory());\n\nSo the failures are consistent with the changes to the code, at least at a glance.\nI suppose I have to make sure the trailing slash works on Windows for the\ntests though.\n\nNow, I've just glanced at the code change, and it seems fine to me. I don't think\nthere's any problem with changing the tests to have the trailing slash.\n\nSo if anyone wants to weigh in with whether the change has any problems please do.\nOtherwise it seems like we should commit it. I'm running the full test suite\nnow and unless someone objects I'll commit this shortly. "
