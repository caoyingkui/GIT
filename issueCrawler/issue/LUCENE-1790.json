    "description": "Similar to the BoostingTermQuery, the BoostingFunctionTermQuery is a SpanTermQuery, but the difference is the payload score for a doc is not the average of all the payloads, but applies a function to them instead.  BoostingTermQuery becomes a BoostingFunctionTermQuery with an AveragePayloadFunction applied to it.\n\nAlso add marker interface to indicate PayloadQuery types.  Refactor Similarity.scorePayload to also take in the doc id.",

Then, in processPayload, you could just have\n\n          payloadScore = function.score(payloadScore, similarity.scorePayload(term.field(), payload, 0, positions.getPayloadLength()));\n\n\ninstead of\n\n          payloadScore = Math.max(payloadScore, similarity.scorePayload(term.field(), payload, 0, positions.getPayloadLength()));\n\n\n or whatever is there.\n\nThen, the getPayloadScore() method (see my patch) would be:\n\nreturn (payloadsSeen > 0 ? (function.finalScore(payloadsSeen, payloadScore)) : 1);\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you have in mind?  I'm pretty tired, so the above may be a bit whacked. ",

Deprecated Similarity.scorePayload(String fieldName, ...) to a similar method that also takes in the Doc id.  Now, in theory, you could have different scoring for payloads based on different documents, fields, etc.  The old method just calls the new one and passes in a NO_DOC_ID_PROVIDED value (-1).\n\n3. Added a Marker Interface named PayloadQuery and marked the various PayloadQueries.  This could be useful for Queries that work with other PayloadQueries (more exclusive than the fact that they are SpanQueries.\n\nI really do intend to commit this  ",
