Puppet simply doesn't start the service because it thinks its already running. Any other script depending on the result of the status command will suffer similar problems.\n\nWorkaround for other Puppet users:\nSetting hasstatus => false and pattern => \"solr.solr.home\" in the service definition works for me.",
