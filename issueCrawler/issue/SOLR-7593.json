Solr 5.2 will include an AngularJS version of the admin UI, which doesn't yet have support for admin extra, partly because I don't understand how/why people would use it. The hope is that from 5.3 it will be the default.\n\nIf I can understand what your use-case is, I can make sure that the feature is supported in the AngularJS version of the UI. ",
