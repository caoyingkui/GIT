    "description": "We have SolrCloud set up with two shards, each with a leader and a replica.  We use haproxy to distribute requests between the four nodes.\n\nRegardless of which node we send an add request to, following a commit, the newly-added document is returned in a search, as expected.\n\nHowever, we can only delete a document if the delete request is sent to a node in the shard where the document was added.  If we send the delete request to a node in the other shard (and then send a commit) the document is not deleted.  Such a delete request will get a 200 response, with the following body:\n\n  {'responseHeader'=>{'status'=>0,'QTime'=>7}}\n\nApart from the the very low QTime, this is indistinguishable from a successful delete.",

In implicit router, the target shard can be specified. In compositeId router, the route parameter is hashed to obtain the target slice (useful for collections that use router.field).\n2. commitWithin wasn't working. Added a fix in SolrCmdDistributor. "
