    "description": "1. Package.html is reasonable satisfactory. The Document class has moderately satisfactory comments.\n\n2. The 6 Field related classes are largely missing class-level comments.\n\n3. The 4 FieldSelect classes are largely missing class-level comments.\n\n4. The 4 tools classes have moderately satisfactory comments, except for the DateTools.Resolution class.\n\nMost of the classes are missing @see references and @since information. Some terminology and concepts need definition, such as \"normalization factors\" and \"term vector\". Method-level comments are generally satisfactory, but somewhat repetitive between classes and interfaces. An interface/abstract method should be explained once only, not repeated in each sub-class.",
