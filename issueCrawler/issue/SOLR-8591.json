    "description": "Now that we have synchronous streaming and continuous streaming (DaemonStream), it makes sense to add batch streaming.\n\nCode will be added to the /stream handler so that when it sees the BatchStream it will send the stream to an executor to be run. \n\nSample syntax:\n\nbatch(parallel(update(rollup(search()))))\n\n\n\nThe pseudo code above runs a parallel rollup in batch mode and sends the output to a SolrCloud collection.",
