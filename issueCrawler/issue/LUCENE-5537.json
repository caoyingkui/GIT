    "description": "The crazy version check in TestCheckIndexes is broken. Whenever it fails, it requires a horrible amount of understanding:\n\n\terror messages are useless\n\tyou don't know what it really checks and why (no documentation)\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have no clear workflow how to handle version updates:\n\n\tIn 4.6 series we never set the dev.version in common-build to 4.6.1, it always stayed 4.6. The test worked therefore, because the LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION (which is always \"x.y\") was identical\n\tIn 4.7 Steve Rowe changed the version to the real release version in the branch. The test failed because of this change (LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION was not identical as the dotted bugfix version)\n\n\n\nWe should in any case fix the test:\n\n\tmove it out of TestCheckIndex, it should be in oal.util.TestConstants\n\tBe more verbose on loggin\n\tRemove special cases (leftovers from 4.0-BETA) where we did crazy stuff to make this test pass in alphas and betas.\n\tOnly add a check to LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION that it is in format \"x.y\" (which is required by Lucene index format), and only check that it is the prefix of the real version as reported by common_build.xml.\n\n\n\nWe should also document and write down when we change the version numbers. I would prefer to use the variant of Lucene 4.6: never change the version number in common-build and \"override\" it while building artifacts.",

            "content": "Hi Robert,\nI agree with that on trunk. But in the stable branch we should ensure with the regex, that the MAIN_VERSIOn is \"x.y\", so we prevent anybody doing releases to put \"4.7.1\" into the LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION.\nIn trunk we can have the stuff with \"5.0.0.x\" for alpha beta (the code checks if 3rd part is \"0\" to detect BETA. But in stable releases we should prevent that.\nSo I can preserve your check in trunk, in 4.x I enforce \"x.y\". Is this fine for you?\n\nYou agree that cleaning that up and especially adding a more detailed comment about how to handle BETA versions would be ok? If not, please take this issue and do the cleanup yourself. All this shit with startWith and so on is un-understandable. I just cleaned it up and it took me also half a day to test this with all branches and version comibantions, not counted the time to understand that stuff (without a good comment).\n\nSteve did not break the build, the build was broken by me in my last commit. It was just not detected in 4.6.1, because we did not change common-build. ",

We have to do this, because our test cases are running against a non-jar classpath, so we have no manifest file with version numbers.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately: Because we don't run test with a real JAR file, we have no manifest, so we would not detect all problems. To ensure also the version constants from a real lucene-core.jar file are OK, we would need to test against one.\n\nI will commit and backport this in a minute (to fix 4.7 builds). ",
