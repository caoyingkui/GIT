    "description": "The LBHttpSolrServer class provides very useful basic load balancing, especially in the context of SolrCloud. But it forces the use of HttpSolrServer underneath, which is not the most efficient when performing updates. The logic should be generalized to support any SolrServer implementation, especially the ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer.",
