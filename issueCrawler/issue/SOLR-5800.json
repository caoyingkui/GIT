    "description": "I have an example in Solr In Action that uses the\nPatternReplaceCharFilterFactory and now it doesn't work in 4.7.0.\nSpecifically, the <fieldType> is:\n\n    <fieldType name=\"text_microblog\" class=\"solr.TextField\"\npositionIncrementGap=\"100\">\n      <analyzer>\n        <charFilter class=\"solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory\"\n                    pattern=\"([a-zA-Z])\\1+\"\n                    replacement=\"$1$1\"/>\n        <tokenizer class=\"solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory\"/>\n        <filter class=\"solr.WordDelimiterFilterFactory\"\n                generateWordParts=\"1\"\n                splitOnCaseChange=\"0\"\n                splitOnNumerics=\"0\"\n                stemEnglishPossessive=\"1\"\n                preserveOriginal=\"0\"\n                catenateWords=\"1\"\n                generateNumberParts=\"1\"\n                catenateNumbers=\"0\"\n                catenateAll=\"0\"\n                types=\"wdfftypes.txt\"/>\n        <filter class=\"solr.StopFilterFactory\"\n                ignoreCase=\"true\"\n                words=\"lang/stopwords_en.txt\"\n                />\n        <filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n        <filter class=\"solr.ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory\"/>\n        <filter class=\"solr.KStemFilterFactory\"/>\n      </analyzer>\n    </fieldType>\n\nThe PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory (PRCF) is used to collapse\nrepeated letters in a term down to a max of 2, such as #yummmm would\nbe #yumm\n\nWhen I run some text through this analyzer using the Analysis form,\nthe output is as if the resulting text is unavailable to the\ntokenizer. In other words, the only results being displayed in the\noutput on the form is for the PRCF\n\nThis example stopped working in 4.7.0 and I've verified it worked\ncorrectly in 4.6.1.\n\nInitially, I thought this might be an issue with the actual analysis,\nbut the analyzer actually works when indexing / querying. Then,\nlooking at the JSON response in the Developer console with Chrome, I\nsee the JSON that comes back includes output for all the components in\nmy chain (see below) ... so looks like a UI rendering issue to me?\n\n{\"responseHeader\":\n{\"status\":0,\"QTime\":24}\n,\"analysis\":{\"field_types\":{\"text_microblog\":{\"index\":[\"org.apache.lucene.analysis.pattern.PatternReplaceCharFilter\",\"#Yumm\n Drinking a latte at Caffe Grecco in SF's historic North Beach...\nLearning text analysis with #SolrInAction by @ManningBooks on my i-Pad\nfoo5\",\"org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.WhitespaceTokenizer\",[\n{\"text\":\"#Yumm\",\"raw_bytes\":\"[23\n59 75 6d 6d]\",\"start\":0,\"end\":6,\"position\":1,\"positionHistory\":[1],\"type\":\"word\"}\n,\n{\"text\":\":)\",\"raw_bytes\":\"[3a\n29]\",\"start\":7,\"end\":9,\"position\":2,\"positionHistory\":[2],\"type\":\"word\"}\n,\n{\"text\":\"Drinking\",\"raw_bytes\":\"[44\n72 69 6e 6b 69 6e\n67]\",\"start\":10,\"end\":18,\"position\":3,\"positionHistory\":[3],\"type\":\"word\"}\n,\n{\"text\":\"a\",\"raw_bytes\":\"[61]\",\"start\":19,\"end\":20,\"position\":4,\"positionHistory\":[4],\"type\":\"word\"}\n,{\"text\":\"latte\",\"raw_bytes\":\"[6c ...\n\nthe JSON returned to the browser has evidence that the full analysis chain was applied, so this seems to just be a rendering issue.",
