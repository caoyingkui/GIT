    "description": "Is it possible to highlight documents in the \"expand\" section in the Solr response?\n\nI'm aware that https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/jiBqAg states:\n\"All downstream components (faceting, highlighting, etc...) will work with the collapsed result set.\"\n\nSo I tried to put the highlight component after the expand component like this:\n\n<arr name=\"components\">\n\t<str>query</str>\n\t<str>facet</str>\n\t<str>stats</str>\n\t<str>debug</str>\n\t<str>expand</str>\n\t<str>highlight</str>\n</arr>\n\nBut with no effect.\n\nIs there another switch that needs to be flipped or could this be implemented easily?\nIMHO this is quite a common use case. And it was possible to highlight all results of a group with the old grouping.",

It's just a rough sketch, but it seems to work.\n\nStill to do:\n\n\tThe order of the ExpandComponent and the HighlightComponent needs to be switched to make it work (as mentioned in the issue description). I'm not sure what effects changing the default order in\norg.apache.solr.handler.component.SearchHandler.getDefaultComponents() may have.\n\tIt would be good to have a config param to turn this on, I guess. Suggestion: hl.expanded=true/false.\n\n ",
