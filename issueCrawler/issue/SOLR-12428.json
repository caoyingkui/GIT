    "description": "Even though Solr comes out of the box with the LTR capabilities, it is not possible to use them in an existing collection without hand editing the solrconfig.xml to add the jar. Many other contrib jars are already present in the _default configset's solrconfig.xml.\n\nI propose to add the ltr jar in the _default configset's solrconfig:\n\n  <lib dir=\"${solr.install.dir:../../../..}/dist/\" regex=\"solr-ltr-\\d.*\\.jar\" />\n\n\n\nAny thoughts, Christine Poerschke?",

The only thing the user is unable to do so far is to be able to add the jar, which is what I was hoping to do here. ",
