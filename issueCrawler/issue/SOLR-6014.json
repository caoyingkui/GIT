    "description": "org.apache.solr.request.StandardRequestHandler may parse the query string incorrectly when \"stop words\" like \"and\" \"in\" etc... are used within nested subqueries.\n\nExample query:\n(((query:\"{!dismax qf=\\\"allfields\\\" }transformation\") AND (query:\"{!dismax qf=\\\"allfields\\\" }in\")))\n\nThe parsed query is:\n+(+(allfields:transform) ()) +(+() ())\n\nThe first subquery (\"transformation\") returns results but the second (\"in\") does not. The term \"in\" is configured as stop word. \n\nExpected result:\nThe query should return the same results as returned by this query: (((query:\"{!dismax qf=\\\"allfields\\\" }transformation\"))). Maybe one should just remove empty term lists?\n\nThis is probably related to SOLR-261.",
