    "description": "This issue builds on\u00a0SOLR-10032. With that issue I created a tool called BeastIt to generate beasting test reports and kicked it off a few times manually, which was simple, but not a job made for man over time.\n\nI took a few months off BeastIt, but just now finished the work I needed to do to support cron'ing a command that can start up vms, generate a report for a git repo and branch, and then shut everything\u00a0down.\n\nThis issue will track getting this automated process smooth and work out how to best advertise the report.\n\nInitially I've setup a report on master to run once a week on Friday night. We will see how that goes.",
