            "content": "Here's a patch. I did more cleanup of outdated breakiterator stuff while I was here. Its not needed after the ICU upgrade (LUCENE-8122).\n\nI added some simple tests, e.g. sequences such as \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc69 (WOMAN + ZWJ + HEAVY BLACK HEART + VARIATION SELECTOR-16 + ZWJ + WOMAN) are recognized as one token because the rules already knew that. \n\nthe filters we have such as ICUNormalizer2Filter/ICUFoldingFilter would reduce the above to WOMAN + HEAVY BLACK HEART + WOMAN, because they remove the default ignorables.

This way it will have the latest uax#29 rules around this stuff such as \"Do not break within emoji zwj sequences.\" So some work to do for that, but we can tackle here with ICU first. ",

            "content": "Updated patch just with some code comments explaining the logic, in particular documenting that its not a perfect science and some alternatives that we could do. The current algorithm is very conservative.\n\nIn the ICU case the word break rules use \"extended text segmentation rules from CLDR\", so breaks themselves also use an $Extended_Pict set, which is a subset of [:Extended_Pictographic:]-[:Emoji:], but being maintained manually I guess?\n\nanyway the logic here could be substantially more aggressive, but I wanted to start with something more simple and by the book, so to speak. \n\nFor more information, see: \n\n\thttp://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#WB3c\n\thttps://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Identification\n\thttps://www.unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/segments/root.xml\n\thttp://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/trunk/icu4c/source/data/brkitr/rules/word.txt\n\n ",

            "content": "I updated with a middle of the road approach better matching our RBBI rules. I don't think it would cause additional complexity if we wanted similar for jflex.\n\nI still kept a TODO around the use the extended_pict set which could be used here just like its using in RBBI rules, for maybe similar future-proofing (e.g. we know emoji evolves rapidly and tokenizers/indexes fall behind, it would be nice). \n\nBut I think its fair to keep as a TODO, we gotta crawl before we can run.
