A screen shot will be also attached.\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Faceting\n\n\tfacet.sort, facet.limit, facet.offset, facet.mincount, facet.missing\n\tfacet.pivot, facet.pivot.mincount\n\tfacet.range, facet.range.start, facet.range.end, facet.range.gap, facet.range.hardend, facet.range.include, facet.range.other\n\n\n\n\n\nand, multiple facet.field and facet.pivot options are allowed in this patch. (I've also tried per field options like f.<fieldname>.facet.sort, but that could bring complexity in the html / JS ...)\n\nYour feedback is welcome.\nIf you're interested, I would like to catch up and work for SOLR-5507, of course.
