It would be great if someone can suggest a quick tip.\n\nThe entry point for the xml doc functionality is /update/xml/docs. It is implicitly registered and no need of request handler. Following parameters are implemented and unit test are added for them\nsplit=Solr based XPath splitter\nf=<field from schema xml>:<xpath splitter>\n\nMore or less functionality is similar to /update/json/docs.
