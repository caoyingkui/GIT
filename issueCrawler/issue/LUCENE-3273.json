    "description": "Most tests use Lucene Core's QueryParser for convenience.  We want to consolidate it into a QP module which we can't have as a dependency.  We should add a simple MockQueryParser which does String.split() on the query string, analyzers the terms and builds a BooleanQuery if necessary.  Any more complex Queries (such as phrases) should be done programmatically.",

            "content": "Patch with first shot at this.\n\n\n\tMockQueryParser is introduced.  It handles a very simple syntax consisting of boolean operators and can identify Wildcard queries.  Cannot handle complex BooleanQuerys, boosts or PhraseQuerys.\n\tQueryBuilderHelper is introduced which provides some utilities methods for building queries (currently just to create a TermQuery with a boost)\n\tBooleanQueryBuilder and PhraseQueryBuilder are introduced to ease the process of programmatically creating complex BooleanQuerys and PhraseQuerys.\n\n\n\n\n\tAll core Lucene tests (apart from those in the queryparser package) have been moved away from relying on QueryParser.  In extremely trivial situations, TermQuerys are now directly instantiated.  In others, the MockQueryParser is used.  In complex scenarios, the Builder classes are used to programmatically create the queries.\n\tSome tests have been split up and moved around.  Tests that did both parsing assertions and search assertions have been split so the parsing assertions go into TestQueryParser (since they are testing the QPs supported language).\n\n\n\nNext step is to visit the contrib tests and clear those out too, so we can prevent any back dependencies on the queryparser module.

I think this is wrong, sometimes more lines of code is good.\n\nparsers, builder apis, and helper methods might reduce the number of lines of code, but they add additional layers and obfuscation that makes this a terrible tradeoff.
