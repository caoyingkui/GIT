You can't force a commit to fake index change. So one has\nto either:\n\n\tadd/delete dummy docs on master to force index change\n\twrite an external script that copies the config file to slaves",

It'd be nice to be able to have various (and custom) triggers that indicate the need and what to replicate.  For example, just touching a query-time synonyms.txt file ought to trigger searchers to pull it (yet this requires a core reload for that file to be reloaded by SynonymFilterFactory, d'oh) "

We may not need more flexibility unless we have usecases to support this.\n\nIt'd be nice to be able to have various (and custom) triggers that indicate the need and what to replicate. \n\ncurrently the trigger is the change in the file's timestamp.
