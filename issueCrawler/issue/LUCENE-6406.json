    "description": "LuceneTestCase overrides the default query cache so that every test runs with its own cache and is reproducible. But it does not reset the query cache when it is finished. As a consequence, any other suite running in the same runner and not inheriting LuceneTestCase will inherit a \"dirty\" query cache.",

This helps in setting up common safety guards consistently (thread leak checks, etc.).\n\nIdeally, it should be a compile-time error to have a test class not extending LTC (directly or indirectly). I can't think of a way to do it at the moment though. "
