    "description": "Followup issue from SOLR-3566:\n\nWhenever you clone the TermIndex, it also creates a clone of the underlying IndexInputs. In high cocurrent environments, the clone method of MMapIndexInput is a bottleneck (it has heavy work to do to manage the weak references in a synchronized block).\n\nEverywhere else in Lucene we use my new WeakIdentityMap for managing concurrent weak maps. For this case I did not do this, as the WeakIdentityMap has no iterators (it doe snot implement Map interface). This issue will add a key and values iterator (the key iterator will not return GC'ed keys), so MMapIndexInput can use WeakIdentityMap backed by ConcurrentHashMap and needs no synchronization. ConcurrentHashMap has better concurrency because it distributes the hash keys in different buckets per thread.",

It will mark the IndexInput as closed (buffers = null) as first step, so later clone() or other access fails with AlreadyClosedException. After unsetting the buffers it will unset all clone buffers and finally unmap them. ",
