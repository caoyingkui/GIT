    "description": "While poking around some SolrJ code, I noticed that the Javadoc documentation tends to be spotty.  Some sections have pretty meticulous descriptions, others are missing javadocs entirely.\n\nI'm not aiming to entirely correct that situation here, but I did want to fix a few of the more serious concerns I ran into in some of my digging.  This list includes:\n\n\tSolrClient.commit should have some warning about the downside of invoking commits on the client side\n\tditto re: SolrClient.rollback\n\tSolrClient's single-doc add method should have a warning about performance implications of not batching.  Not sure if this should live in SolrClient itself and be worded as a \"potential\" perf impact, or live in each of the clients it applies to.\n\tthe SolrClient builders can use some clarification around when particular settings are useful.\n\tResponseParser and some other classes might benefit from some high level class javadocs.\n\n\n\nFigured this was worth a JIRA so others can catch potential mistakes I'm making here, or suggest other SolrJ things that'd really benefit from Javadocs.",
