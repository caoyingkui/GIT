Feels a bit of a jump and somebody that should have been discussed (to death?) on a mailing list first.\n\nAlso, having a simple switch implies flipping it makes things work the other way. But there is a bunch of different pieces that make managed schema actually manageable. I am thinking of UpdateRequestProcessor chain, but I suspect there are other differences. ",
