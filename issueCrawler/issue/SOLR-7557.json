    "description": "Getting the results from a query that as child documents results in \"parsing error\" when using SolrClient's queryAndStreamResponse(), but not when using the regular query() method.\n\nThe bug is caused by StreamingBinaryResponseParser's JavaBinCodec override of readSolrDocument which always returns null (the document is instead passed to the callback), but JavaBinCodec uses the method to also decode child documents.\n\nI have fixed this by using a simple nestedLevel variable that can be used to detect if the document being parsed is a child (and should be returned) or a parent (and should be passed to the callback).\n\nThe fix feels kinda hacky, but it is simple.

Your bumping of the issue on the mailing list\u00a0caught my attention, thanks\u00a0Marvin Bredal Lillehaug.\n\nThe unit test is placed in `BasicHttpSolrClientTest`. The only other place I can find a test of the streaming binary writer is `SolrExampleTestsBase#testStreamingRequest`, but that is for testing streaming on request side. In lack of a separate BinaryResponseParserTest I guess it is as good location as any other.\n\n\u00a0 ",
