    "description": "Currently this rejects any rectangles within a delta as being \"too close to an edge\", and returns null, which means those are not tested in the random test.\n\nBut we already compensate for quantization in the test, we should just remove this additional delta. \n\nThe only problem I found in beasting is that, due to the algorithm being used for polygons, it obeys the \"definition of insideness\" described here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Shape.html\n\nIn my opinion, this test should work just like the distance test, and just ensure the query is consistent with GeoRelationUtils.pointInPolygon(). Anything the query is doing other than running that in brute-force is purely an optimization. This also makes it easier to test more interesting polygons in the future other than just rectangles.\n\nSeparately, we can test that this basic method works correctly better if we want, but that can just be a unit test.",
