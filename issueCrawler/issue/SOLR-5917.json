    "description": "The dynamic field schema specification is handy for when you want a bunch of fields of a given type, but don't know how many there will be.\n\nYou do currently need to know how many there will be (and the exact names) if you want to query them, however.\n\nIf edismax supported a similar wildcard specification like qf=\"dynfield_*\", this would allow easy search across a given field type. It would also provide a convenient alternative to multi-value fields without the fieldNorm implications of having multiple values in a single field.",
