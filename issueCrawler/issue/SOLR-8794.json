    "description": "If my reading of the code is correct any usage of solr/sharedLib ,solr/coreLoadThreads , solr/persistent and solr/zkHost in the solr.xml file will throw an error currently.\n\nThis is ensured using this code block in SolrXmlConfig.java\n\n\n    failIfFound(config, \"solr/@coreLoadThreads\");\n    failIfFound(config, \"solr/@persistent\");\n    failIfFound(config, \"solr/@sharedLib\");\n    failIfFound(config, \"solr/@zkHost\");\n\n\n\nIn the same class however , these properties are read. For example,\n\n\n        case \"sharedLib\":\n          builder.setSharedLibDirectory(value);\n          break;\n\n\n\nThis should be redundant and I think we can remove them. More importantly we should remove usage of it from the wiki page ( https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Format+of+solr.xml )\n\nAlso does anyone know if keeping {[managementPath}} is useful for the future? The wiki's description for it is \"Currently non-operational.\"",
