    "description": "I noticed Porter's Snowball stemmers have some new versions available, among them Turkish, Hungarian, etc.  It also looks like the packaging has changed a little bit.  It would be useful to build a new version and update Lucene's contrib to include these new versions.\n\nWould also be helpful if we could submit a patch back to the Snowball project to put an abstract declaration of the stem() method into the SnowballProgram.\n\nhttp://snowball.tartarus.org/",
