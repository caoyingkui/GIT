    "description": "While looking at LUCENE-3233, i noticed a few things:\n\n\tlots of internal methods (e.g. copy) use grow(). I don't think they should do this. CharsRef should work like BytesRef, i don't think it needs to be a stringbuffer. i think its ok to expose a public grow() method like we did for bytesref though.\n\tthe append() method is totally confusing, and doesnt make sense compared to BytesRef, copy() might also have issues.\n\ta lot of these methods are unused, we should at least add tests for them, or remove ones we don't need.",
