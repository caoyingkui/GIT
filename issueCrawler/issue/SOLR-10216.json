    "description": "After getting our interval for calling delta index shorter and shorter, I\nhave found out that last_index_time  in dataimport.properties is not\nupdated every time the indexing runs, it is skipped if no docs where added.\n\nThis happens at least in the following scenario:\n\n\trunning delta as full index\n( /dataimport?command=full-import&clean=false&commit=true )\n\tSolrcloud setup, so dataimport.properties is in zookeeper\n\tSolr 5.5.0\n\n\n\nI understand skipping the commit on the index if no docs were updated is a\nnice optimization, but I believe the last_index_time info should be updated\nin all cases, so it reflects reality. We, for instance, are looking at this\npiece of information in order to do other stuff.",
