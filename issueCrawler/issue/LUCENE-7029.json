    "description": "My use case involve that in some situations I need to get a lot of documents from the index. Most of my documents are small (less than 2KB).\n\nI use API: IndexReader.document(id, visitor), but I noticed it keeps decompressing same block over and over again.\n\nIf we have an api that let's me get many documents at once, I could do the same job way faster.\n\nAfter some experiment I realized I can get 2x+ gains on performance with this simple feature.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a newbie to lucene project. I truly appreciate hard work by all contributors for this awesome library. I would be more than happy to contribute back and get my hands dirty. Any help and pointers is more than welcomed.",
