    "description": "I have a simple collection containing 6 documents, each document has a field \ncategory.  The values for this field are:\nWine\nWines\nGrape\nGrapes\nCheese\nCheeses\n\nIf I search category for wines, I return one hit (wines).  If I search for \nwine, I return 2 hits (wine, wines).  I see the same behavior with grape and \ngrapes.  When I search for cheeses, I return one hit (cheeses).  But when I \nsearch for cheese, I also return one hit (cheese).  I expected 2 hits (cheese, \ncheeses).  I can not explain this behavior.  Is there an explanation for this \nbehavior or is this a bug?\n\nI'm using the standard analyzer and query parser.  I first saw this behavior \nin my application that implements Lucene.  So, I used the Luke application to \nsearch my collection and found the same behavior.  I used Luke to peek into my \ncollection, but found what I expected, nothing unusual in the collection.\n\nAny insight greatly appreciated.",
