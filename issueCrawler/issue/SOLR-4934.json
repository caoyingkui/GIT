The only thing I knew was that LUCENE-5038 had caused Solr to make compound files and the useCompoundFile setting under indexConfig that I found in the branch_4x example wasn't turning it off.\n\nA connected discussion, for which I can file an issue if necessary: Assuming there are plenty of file descriptors available, will a user get better performance from compound files or separate files?  Is it dependent on other factors like filesystem choice, or is one a clear winner?  The outcome of that discussion should decide what Solr's default is when no related config options are used. "

I've opened SOLR-4941 to track that, and we'll leave this issue specifically about the broken initargs config option.\n\nEDIT: fixed issue number "

IndexInputSlicer returns optimized indexinputs that remove the whole file offset stuff. Indexing speed is identical, too, but merging (done in background) is more expensive. "
