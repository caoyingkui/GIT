    "description": "With jdk8-b89, the linting of javadocs with Eclipse's JDT compiler (ECJ) does no lonmger work:\n\n\tThe version we currently use (3.7.2) can no longer parse the class files in rt.jar / or does no longer find them\n\tThe latest version (4.2.2) produces a compiler error, because it cannot handle some \"default\" interface method duplication in some Java Collections interfaces (CharArraySet fails)\n\n\n\nI will disable the ECJ linting for now with Java > 1.7",
