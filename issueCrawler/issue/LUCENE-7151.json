    "description": "For spanNear([spanNear([contents:word1, contents:word3], 2, true), spanNear([contents:word2, contents:word3], 2, true)], 2, false)\n\nScores for the following two documents should be the same but are not.\ndoc1: [----- word1 word3 ----- word2 word3 ----- word1 word2 word3 -----]\ndoc2: [----- word2 word3 ----- word1 word3 ----- word1 word2 word3 -----]\n\nThe positions of the inner clauses effect the scoring for the of the final 3-term phrase. This appears to be a side-effect of the span-scoring rewrite in 5.2. \n\nNearSpansUnordered's SpansCell.adjustMax() uses end-position values to decide maxEndPositionCell while the SpanPositionQueue uses start-position and end-position values to sort the SpanCells. This means that maxEndPositionCell will be incorrectly set or not set depending on previous positions.\n\nI can provide example code illustrating the score error.",
