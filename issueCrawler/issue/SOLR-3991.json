If spell check is defined for query component, and collation is on, collation executor also tries to fetch the searcher and creates a deadlock.\n\nTo replay:\n1. Define the warmup query\n2. Add spell checker configuration to the /select search handler\n3. Set spellcheck.collation = true \n\nConfiguration:\nzkRun\ncollection1\n2 shards\n1 node\n4 cores",
