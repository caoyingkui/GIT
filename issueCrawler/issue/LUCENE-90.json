The 2 versions named lucene-src.tar.gz and lucene-src.zip\ninclude sources only. *.jj files are JavaCC grammar files that you can convert\ninto .java and then .class files using the included Ant build.xml.\nThis is not a bug, so I will close this bug.\nIf, however, you downloaded a binary nightly build and it contains .jj files and\nnot those 3 that you say are missing, please feel free to re-open this bug report.\n ",
