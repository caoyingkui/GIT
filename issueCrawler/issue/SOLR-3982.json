    "description": "Started with Shawn's Request about a small refresh link, one change leads to the next, which is the reason why i changed this issue towards a more common one\n\nThis Patch brings:\n\n\tA \"Refresh Status\" Button\n\tA \"Abort Import\" Button\n\tImproved Status-Handling\n(was buggy if you have multiple Cores with Handlers for Dataimport defined and you switched the view while at least one was running)\n\tAdditional Stats on Rows/Documents\n(on-the-fly calculated \"X Docs/second\")\n\tless buggy duration-to-readable-time conversion\n(until now resulted in NaN's showing up on your Screen)\n\n\n\nOriginal Description:\n\nThe dataimport section under each core on the admin gui does not provide a way to get the current import status.  I actually would like to see it automatically pull the status as soon as you click on \"Dataimport\" ... I have never seen an import status with a qtime above 1 millisecond.  A refresh icon/link would be good to have as well.\n\nAdditional note: the resulting URL in the address bar is a little odd:\nhttp://server:port/solr/#/corename/dataimport//dataimport\n\nAlthough i gave a short explanation on the URL looking a bit odd:\n\nThe first \"dataimport\" is required for the UI to detect which section you're browsing .. the second \"/dataimport\" (including the slash, yes) is coming from your solrconfig",
