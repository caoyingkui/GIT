    "description": "See the improvements in LUCENE-2302.\n\nTermAttribute has been deprecated for flexible indexing, as terms can really be anything, as long as they can\nbe serialized to byte[]. \n\nFor character-terms, a CharTermAttribute has been created, with a more friendly API. Additionally this attribute\nimplements the CharSequence and Appendable interfaces.\n\nWe should convert all Solr tokenstreams to use this new attribute.",
