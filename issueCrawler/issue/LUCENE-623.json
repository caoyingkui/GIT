            "content": "I propose a trivial patch, which does two very simple things:\n\n1. RAMDirectory.close(), instead of being a no-op, sets files=null. This allows the garbage collector to collect all the memory that was used for this RAMDirectory (this is the best we can do in Java).\n\n2. Make the documentation more explicit, from \"Closes the store to future operations.\" to \"Closes the store to future operations, releasing associated memory.\"\n\nNote that now, after a close(), any operations on the RAMDirectory will likely result in a NullPointerException. I don't think this matters, as the documentation clearly says that after a close() you're not allowed to operate on this object. ",

If so, that would have been the ideal place to fix it any kind of \"leak\".\n\nThis patch, while not doing much harm, is not really \"best practice\" in Java and the existing RAMDirectory close() was correct.\nAm I missing something?
