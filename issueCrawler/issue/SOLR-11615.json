But the page is immutable. No method for commenting on it is apparent.\n\n(2) \u201cContributors should join the Solr mailing lists.\u201d The link to mailing lists is obsolete.",

The comment system mentions that for some functionality an account must be created, but has no information about how to create an account.\n\nI suspect that for the new ref guide that is generated from the source code, Jira is probably the best way for extensive changes, and a mailing list message (either solr-user or dev) would be a good idea for extremely simple changes.\n\nJonathan Pool, anybody can edit the HowToContribute page.  All that is needed is to create an account on the Solr wiki and request edit permissions on the IRC channel, the solr-user list, or the dev list.\n\nI have fixed a couple of links for Solr mailing lists to point to the correct page.

It all comes from ASF Comments System: https://comments.apache.org/help.html, via JavaScript that's inserted into the page (which we cannot control). I thought I had written some docs on this, but apparently I haven't yet.\n\nThe comment system mentions that for some functionality an account must be created, but has no information about how to create an account.\n\nThe same line that has the button to add a comment to a page, has a link to \"Login/Register\". When you follow that, you get a login screen, and a link there says to click a different link if you are a committer. I've added a screenshot.\n\nThis issue isn't about the Ref Guide, though, it's about the Solr Wiki page that describes how to contribute to the project overall. ",
