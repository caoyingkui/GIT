Contains a RegexRulesPasswordProvider backed by regex rules file and/or explicit password.\n\nNew solr cell request params:\n\n\tresource.password - explicit password for this file\n\tpasswordsFile - name of property file with list of known passwords based on filename regex. Loaded using ResourceLoader\n\n\n\nNote that Tika currently support passwords for PDF and DOCX files, not legacy DOC files or any other type. I tried to decrypt the existing test file password-is-solrcell.docx but it fails due to unsupported enctyption method in Apache POI.\n\nIn order to apply this patch and have tests pass, you also need to add two binary files by unzipping SOLR-1929-extra-docs.zip in project root.
