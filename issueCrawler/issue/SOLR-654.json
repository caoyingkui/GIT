    "description": "The current SolrResponse implementations put most of their logic within a class specific constructor.  This makes it difficult to dynamically build and populate a SolrResponse via reflection.\n\nThis patch removes the NamedList<Object> from most constructors and puts it into a method: setResponse( NamedList )",
