    "description": "The StandardTokenizer assumes that if a phrase contains a comma and at least one\ndigit, the phrase has to be a number. We are trying to index comma-separated\nvalues of SAP R/3 trancation codes along with standard text. Many of these code\ncontain digits, e.g. \"VA01\" or \"SE80\". While tokenizing text containing these\ncodes, lucene recognizes a comma-separated list of them as a digit, e.g.\n\"VA01,VA02,VA03\". The grammar should be modified to recognize numbers correctly\n(e.g. containing only digits).",
