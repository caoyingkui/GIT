I suspect there are existing script users who might stick with using the scripts for a while since they already know them and understand them.  if there are easy improvements to be made, we might as well (or at the very least, leave the issues with patches open so they're easy to find)\n\nthat said: i'm not much of a shell script/rsync expert.\n\nOtis mentioned that it was untested, has anyone tried it out?\n\nBIll: any thoughts on this?
