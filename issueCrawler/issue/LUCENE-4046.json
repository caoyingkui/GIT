    "description": "Currently, DocsEnum#freq() does not allow IOException. This is problematic if somebody wants to implement a codec that allows lazy loading of freq. Frequency will be read and decoded only when #freq() will be called, therefore calling IndexInput's read methods that can throw IOException.\n\nThe current workaround is to catch the IOException in freq() and ignore it (which is not very nice and not a good solution).",
