I implemented JaroWinkler since I'm suggesting proper names and it does a good job with those.\n\nWith the StringDistance interface defined, anyone can implement the distance measure however they want.  What I think would be very useful is weighted version of edit distance with the weights tuned to your target language/domain.  Also with support in solr for specifying this parameter in the SpellCheckRequestHandler, changing this just becomes a config change.\n\n ",

This is why the patch fails to apply.\n\nThanks. ",

A getter would make sense too, so that one can see what the threshold is.\n\nAlso, the TRStringDistance explicitly states that it is not thread safe.  I believe it is now being used in a non thread-safe manner.  FWIW, I see no reason why it can't be made thread-safe.  All of those member variables are being allocated in the getDistance method, so no reason not to just make them local variables, I think. ",

It just converts the int from the Levenshtein into a value between 0 and 1.      1 being identical, 0 being maximally different.  This return value is part of the StringDistance interface and different methods compute this value differently so it's necessary to compute it on a per distance measure basis.   \n\nThanks...Tom ",
