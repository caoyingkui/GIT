    "description": "Lucene IndexWriters use an infoStream to log detailed info about indexing operations for debugging purpose. This patch is an extremely simple way to allow logging this info to a file from within Solr: After applying the patch, set the new \"defaultInfoStreamFilePath\" attribute of the solr element in solr.xml to the path of the file where you'd like to save the logging information.\n\nNote that, in a multi-core setup, all cores will end up logging to the same infoStream log file. This may not be desired. (But it does justify putting the setting in solr.xml rather than solrconfig.xml.)",

            "content": "adding support for setInfoStream seems like a good idea, but specifying a filename in the config file and writing a new TimeLoggingPrintStream class smells like reinventing logging.\n\nIt seems like it would be simpler just to add a new boolean \"infoStream\" config option, and then leverage the existing logging framework by constructing an instance of a PrintStream that just proxies to SLF4J when the boolean property is true.  A PrintStream instance that writes to a Logger seems no harder to implement then an PrintStream that knows how to prepend messages with a timestamp \u2013 and by using the standard logging framework, solr admins can customize it however they want.\n\nIt looks like someone may have already thought this type of problem through a lot more indepth then us anyway...\nhttp://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110 "

            "content": "I see your point Hoss.\n\nBut at the same time, this is a special debug log that I would likely want to see only when I specifically turn it on to debug (usually for a Lucene dev to look at). Likely I just want to see the log in isolation - Mike M will prob have a hard time looking through it mixed in with all of the Solr logging \n\nNow you can do that with log4j/jdk logging, but its a hassle. Youd have to setup a config that captured the right package, and setup a file for it to write to... and it would likely be a hassle for people when I said, hey just turn on the IndexWriter debug stream, and setup your logging config to isolate it to a single file, and ...\n\nAnd it just seems like you would almost never want the info dispersed with everything else in the standard log.\n\nTimeLoggingPrintStream isnt really to reinvent logging - its just to shove in a timestamp as I guess Lucene doesn't.\n\nSo, I see your point, and I'm not really arguing against yet (Likely you have good counter points), but thats the way I see it at the moment...
