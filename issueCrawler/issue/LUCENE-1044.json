    "description": "When indexing a large number of documents, upon a hard power failure  (e.g. pull the power cord), the index seems to get corrupted. We start a Java application as an Windows Service, and feed it documents. In some cases (after an index size of 1.7GB, with 30-40 index segment .cfs files) , the following is observed.\n\nThe 'segments' file contains only zeros. Its size is 265 bytes - all bytes are zeros.\nThe 'deleted' file also contains only zeros. Its size is 85 bytes - all bytes are zeros.\n\nBefore corruption, the segments file and deleted file appear to be correct. After this corruption, the index is corrupted and lost.\n\nThis is a problem observed in Lucene 1.4.3. We are not able to upgrade our customer deployments to 1.9 or later version, but would be happy to back-port a patch, if the patch is small enough and if this problem is already solved.",

Lucene is \"semi-transactional\": at any & all moments you should\n: be able to destroy the JVM and the index will be unharmed. I would\n: really like to get to the bottom of why this is not the case here.\n\nAt any point you can shutdown the JVM and the index will be unharmed, but\n\"destroying\" it with \"kill -9\" goes a little farther then that.  \n\nLucene can't make that claim because the JVM can't even garuntee that\nbytes are written to physical disk when we close() an OutputStream \u2013 all\nit garuntees is that the bytes have been handed to the OS.  When you \"kill\n-9\" a process the OS is free to make EVERYTHING about that process\nvanish without cleaning up after it ... i'm pretty sure even pending IO\noperations are fair game for disappearing.\n\n...what's true for \"kill -9\" is true for hanking the power cord ... if the JVM isn't shut down cleanly, there is nothing Lucene or the JVM can do to guarantee that your index is in a consistent state.

            "content": "The last comment is not correct, in that, there are many Java based applications (and non-java) that offer true transactional integrity.\n\nIt usually involves a log file, and using sync to ensure data is written to disk.\n\nThe Lucene structure allows for this VERY easily, as the 'segments' file controls everything.\n\nIf all previous files are \"synced\", and then the 'segments.new' file written, and synced (with a marker/checksum). Then the old 'segments' deleted, and 'segments.new' 'renamed to 'segments'. It is trivial to ensure transactional integrity.\n\nUpon index open, check for segments.new - if doesn't exist, or does not have a valid checksum, delete all segments not in 'segments', if it is valid, then reattempt the rename. Then open the index. ",

I thought it would, because the background\nthread, though not holding current thread from continue with indexing, \ndoes force the sync now rather than letting the IO subsystem actually \nwrite stuff on its time. I was also hoping that by doing them later, \nsome of the syncs would become no-ops, and hence faster. I found\nout however that delaying the syncs (but intending to sync) also \nmeans keeping the file handles open, and therefore  this is not \na practical approach. Still it was interesting to compare. \n\nSo... my small test sequentially writes M characters to N files \nand either do not sync (just close), or does sync in one of three \nways: (1) at the end, (2) immediately, (3) in a background thread. \nThe results (in millis) on my Windows XP were:\n\n\n\n\n num files \n num chars per file \n No Sync \n Sync At End \n Background Sync \n Immediate Sync \n\n\n   100 \n 10000 \n   631 \n   5778 \n   5729 \n   5828 \n\n\n   100 \n 10000 \n   581 \n   4486 \n   4117 \n   4687 \n\n\n  1000 \n  1000 \n  1612 \n  38996 \n  34900 \n  35852 \n\n\n  1000 \n  1000 \n  1432 \n  37153 \n  35051 \n  37263 \n\n\n 10000 \n   100 \n 10335 \n 154262 \n 162103 \n 174251 \n\n\n 10000 \n   100 \n 11276 \n 147752 \n 159480 \n 222450 \n\n\n\n\n\nEach configuration ran twice and there are fluctuations, \nbut it is obvious (as Mike noticed) that no-sync is much faster\nthen sync. In fact in my test no-sync is at least 10 times faster\nthan any sync approach, while in Mike's test which is using \nLucene the penalty is smaller.

So syncs, if any, should map 1:1 to commits, no? Folks can make indexing faster by committing/syncing less often.\n\nBut must every \"automatic buffer flush\" by IndexWriter really be a\n\"permanent commit\"?  I do agree that when you close an IndexWriter, we\nshould should do a \"permanent commit\" (and block until it's done).\n\nEven if we use that policy, the BG sync thread can still fall behind\nsuch that the last few/many flushes are still in-process of being made\npermanent (eg I see this happening while a merge is running).  In fact\nI'll have to block further flushes if syncing falls \"too far\" behind,\nby some metric.  So, we already won't have any \"guarantee\" on when a\ngiven flush actually becomes permanent even if we adopt this policy.\n\nI think \"merge finished\" should be made a \"permanent commit\" because\notherwise we are tying up potentially alot of disk space,\ntemporarily.  But for a flush there's only a tiny amount of space (the\nold segments_N files) being tied up.\n\nMaybe we could make some flushes permanent but not all, depending on\nhow far behind the sync thread is.  EG if you do a flush, but, the\nsync thread is still trying to make the last flush permanent, don't\nforce the new flush to be permanent?\n\nIn general, I think the longer we can wait after flushing before\nforcing the OS to make those writes \"permanent\", the better the\nchances that the OS has in fact already sync'd those files anyway, and\nso the sync cost should be lower.  So maybe we could make every flush\npermanent, but wait a little while before doing so?\n\nRegardless of what policy we choose here (which commits must be made\n\"permanent\", and, when) I think the approach requires that\nIndexFileDeleter query the Directory so that it's only allowed to\ndelete older commit points once a newer commit point has successfully\nbecome permanent.\n\nI also worry about those applications that are accidentally flushing\ntoo often now.  Say your app now sets maxBufferedDocs=100.  Right now,\nthat gives you poor performance but not disastrous, but I fear if we\ndo the \"every commit is permanent\" policy then performance could\neasily become disastrous.

The current\n    \"policy\" is to sync only after merges are committed.  When\n    autoCommit=false we do not sync until close() or commit() is\n    called\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded MockRAMDirectory.crash() to simulate a machine crash.  It\n    keeps track of un-synced files, and then in crash() it goes and\n    corrupts any unsynced files rather aggressively.\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded a new unit test, TestCrash, to crash the MockRAMDirectory at\n    various interesting times & make sure we can still load the\n    resulting index.\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded new Directory.sync() method.  In FSDirectory.sync, if I hit\n    an IOException when opening or sync'ing, I retry (currently after\n    waiting 5 msec, and retrying up to 5 times).  If it still fails\n    after that, the original exception is thrown and the new\n    segments_N will not be written (and, the previous commit will also\n    not be deleted).\n\n\n\nAll tests now pass, but there is still alot to do, eg at least:\n\n\n\tJavadocs\n\n\n\n\n\tRefactor syncing code so DirectoryIndexReader.doCommit can use it\n    as well.\n\n\n\n\n\tChange format of segments_N to include a hash of its contents, at\n    the end.  I think this is now necessary in case we crash after\n    writing segments_N but before we can sync it, to ensure that\n    whoever next opens the reader can detect corruption in this\n    segments_N file.\n\n\n ",

            "content": "New rev of this patch.  All tests pass.  I think it's ready to\ncommit, but I'll wait a few days for comments.\n\nThis patch has a small change to the segments_N file: it adds a\nchecksum to the end.  I added ChecksumIndexInput/Output that wrap an\nexisting IndexInput/Output for this.  This is used to verify the file\nis \"intact\" before trusting its contents when opening the index.  We\nneed this to guard against the machine crashing after we've written\nsegments_N and before we've succeeded in syncing it.\n\nUnfortunately, in testing performance, I still see a sizable (~30-50%)\nperformance hit to indexing throughput, on windows computers (XP Pro\nlaptop & Win 2003 Server R64 computer).  It seems that calling sync\nwas causing IO in other threads (ie flushing a new segment) to\ndrasically slow down.  Note that this is only when autoCommit=true; if\nit's false then performance is only slightly worse (because only on\nclosing the writer do we sync)\n\nSo I tried sleeping, after writing and before syncing.  I sleep based\non number of bytes written, for up to 10 seconds, and amazingly, this\ngreadly reduces the performance loss on the windows computers, and\ndoesn't hurt performance on Linux/OS X computers.\n\nI think this must be because calling sync immediately forces the OS to\nwrite dirty buffers to disk \"in a rush\" (severely impacting IO writes\nfrom other threads), whereas if you wait first, you let the OS\nschedule those writes on its own, at good times (maybe when IO system\nis \"relatively\" idle).\n\nIt's disappointing to have to \"game\" the OS to gain back this\nperformance.  I wish Java had a \"waitUntilSync'd\" to do the same\nthings as fsync, but without \"rushing\" the OS.\n\nOn Linux 2.6.22 on a RAID5 array I still see a net performance cost of\n~12%, sleeping or no sleeping.  On Mac OS X it's ~3% loss.\n\nOther fixes:\n\n\tDirectoryIndexReader's doCommit now also syncs\n\tImproved logic on when we must sync-before-CFS: it's not necessary\n    if the just-merged segments are not referenced by the last commit\n    point (ie if they were all flushed during this writer session)\n\tCreated SegmentInfos.commit() method, which writes and then syncs\n    the next segments_N file\n\tSimplified sync() logic now that merge threads are stopped before\n    writer is closed\n\tChanged CMS.newMergeThread to name its threads\n\tMore test cases\n\tVarious other small fixes\n\n\n\nHere are test details.

            "content": "On thinking through the above costs of committing, I now think we\nshould deprecate autoCommit=true entirely, making autocommit=false the\nonly choice in 3.0.\n\nWith that change, when you use an IndexWriter, its changes are never\nvisible to a reader until you call commit() or close().  I think this\nis how KinoSearch and Ferret work, for example.\n\nHere are some reasons:\n\n\n\tCommit has now become a costly event, because sync() is costly,\n    and is forcing us to use this \"syncPause\" logic (hack) to game the\n    OS, which really is ugly, dependent on OS/IO particulars, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\tSince we make no guarantee on when a commit specifically happens,\n    and this fix in particular will reduce its frequency from \"every\n    flush\" to \"every merge\", autoCommit=true really is not that useful\n    for applications (ie, they will have to call commit() on their\n    anyway if they need to rely on its frequency).\n\n\n\n\n\tIt's always possible to build an autocommit layer above\n    IndexWriter by calling commit on your own schedule, to tradeoff\n    performance for commit frequency (but not vice/versa).\n\n\n\n\n\tNot autocommitting by default opens up some good future\n    optimizations on merging since we don't have to flush real\n    segments to disk until commit.  One simple example is we could\n    skip building CFS files as we flush, and only merge & build CFS on\n    commit/close.\n\n\n\nWhat do people think?\n\nIf we do this, I would right now deprecate all ctors that take\nautoCommit and add comment explaining that in 3.0 autoCommit is wired\nto \"false\".  I would leave the \"syncPause\" logic in there for now,\nbecause it's such a sizable performance gain on windows, but deprecate\nit, stating that with it will be removed when we switch to\nautoCommit=false in 3.0.
