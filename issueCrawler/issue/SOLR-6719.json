    "description": "Yashveer Rana pointed this out in the ref guide comments...\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Collections+API?focusedCommentId=47382851#comment-47382851\n\n\n\tCollection CREATE is documented to support \"property.name=value\" (where 'name' and 'property' are italics placeholders for user supplied key=val) as \"Set core property name to value. See core.properties file contents.\"\n\tThe docs for core.properties include a list of supported property values, including \"name\" (literal) as \"The name of the SolrCore. You'll use this name to reference the SolrCore when running commands with the CoreAdminHandler.\"\n\n\n\nFrom these docs, it's reasonable to assume that using a URL like this...\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=my_collection&numShards=2&configSet=data_driven_schema_configs&property.name=my_corename\n\n...should cause \"my_collection\" to be created, with the core name used for every replica being \"my_corename\" ... but that doesn't happen.  instead the replicas get core names like \"my_collection_shard1_replica1\"\n\n\n\nThis is either a bug, or (my suspicion) it's intentional that the user specific core name is not being used \u2013 if it's intentional, then the Collection CREATE command should fail with a clear error if a user does try to use \"property.name\" rather then silently ignoring it and the Collection CREATE docs should be updated to make it clear that \"name\" is an exception to the general property.foo -> foo in core.properties support.",

Unless it was something like\nmy_corename_shard1_replica1, i.e. just substituting \"my_corename\" for the name parameter to CREATE.\n\nIf we just used \"my_corename\", how would we distinguish between two different shards hosted in the same\nSolr instance? Or even two replicas of the same core? Or am I missing something?\n\nAll of which says that I'd favor option 2; change the docs.\n\nFWIW ",
