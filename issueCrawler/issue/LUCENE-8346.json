    "description": "QueryBuilder creates one span near query per path when multi-word synonyms are detected in a phrase query. Span near queries are created using createSpanQuery which is a protected final method. Since the method is final it is not possible to change the behavior in a subclass. It can be useful for clients to change how this query is built so I propose to make it a non-final protected method.",
