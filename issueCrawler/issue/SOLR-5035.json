    "description": "Currently, all of the grouping work is coupled into the QueryComponent. It seems that we can split the component into two different components, without writing even one extra line of code.\n\nBest example is, in method 'prepare' of the QueryComponent:\n\nboolean grouping = params.getBool(GroupParams.GROUP, false);\nif (!grouping) {\n    return;\n}\n\n\n\n(Obviously, I forgot to mention that after that code, there are dozens of lines, which only relevant to grouping.)\n\nThis is clearly unnecessary coupling...",
