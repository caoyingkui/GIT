    "description": "A bunch of CMS pages lack the <html> and </html> tags. I don't know the history of this, was it intentional? I tried to fix it, but it's a bit confusing. (This is a spinoff from SOLR-7107).\n\nCrawling lucene.apache.org with bin/post fails with 500 errors since Tika autodetect sees <head> as the first tag and believes it is XML \n\nI think we're fine if all templates referred to from lib/path.pm have <html> tags added, and that none of them include eachother. Currently, core.html is both a top-page and also included from mirrors-core-latest-redir.html and mirrors-core-redir.html for some reason.\n\nTo reproduce the crawl errors:\n\nbin/post -c gettingstarted http://lucene.apache.org/core/corenews.html\n\n\n\nWe could in addition improve SimplePostTool to send a content-type hint to Tika. Update: The tool already does this",
