After 5.3 we have native support for inter-node authentication. This lets you to have only one user/pwd combination in the entire cluster which meant all requests were performed as same user\n\nIMHO we should deprecate this.\n\nThis ticket makes the user/pwd configurable of a per request basis.\n\n\nSolrRequest req ;//create  anew request object\nreq.setBasicAuthCredentials(userName,  password);\nsolrClient.request(req);\n\n ",
