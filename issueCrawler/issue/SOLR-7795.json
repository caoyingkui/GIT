    "description": "Now that range faceting supports a \"filter\" and a \"dv\" method, and that interval faceting is supported on fields with docValues=false, I think we should make it so that interval faceting is just a different way of specifying ranges in range faceting, allowing users to indicate specific ranges.\nI propose we use the same syntax for intervals, but under the \"range\" parameter family:\n\nfacet.range=price&\nf.price.facet.range.set=[0,10]&\nf.price.facet.range.set=(10,100]\n\n\n\nThe counts for those ranges would come in the response also inside of the \"range_facets\" section. I'm not sure if it's better to include the ranges in the \"counts\" section, or in a different section (intervals?sets?buckets?). I'm open to suggestions. \n\n\"facet_ranges\":{\n      \"price\":{\n        \"counts\":[\n          \"[0,10]\",3,\n          \"(10,100]\",2]\n       }\n}\n\n\nor\u2026\n\n\"facet_ranges\":{\n      \"price\":{\n        \"intervals\":[\n          \"[0,10]\",3,\n          \"(10,100]\",2]\n       }\n}\n\n\nWe should support people specifying both things on the same field.\nOnce this is done, \"interval faceting\" could be deprecated, as all it's functionality is now possible through range queries.",

One concern that I have is that before this patch (and assuming that we remove interval faceting), people could do interval faceting and range faceting on the same request for the same field. If we apply this patch and remove interval faceting then this is no longer possible. Do you think we could support specifying both, start+end+gap (plus other range params) AND facet.range.set in the same request?\n\nAlso, I'm not entirely sure if this syntax will be the best, it does sound confusing, at least to me, specially when looking at SolrJ code:\nf.FIELD.facet.range.set=\nis done by using the method \"addIntervalRangeFacets\", and the response also includes a list of \"IntervalFacet\" instances. Do you, or anyone else have any opinions on this? ",

I'll look into this.\n\nFor the response syntax, I was thinking of bringing this feature without modifying too much code so I made use of the previous syntax.
