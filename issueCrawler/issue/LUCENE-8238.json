I don't know the history here, but it sounds as if the docs might be referring to some previous incarnation of this filter, perhaps in the context of some (now-defunct) Solr configuration.\n\nThe docs should be updated to reference the actual option names that are provided by the class today.\n\u00a0\nI've attached a patch",
