    "description": "the optimize command currently supports a \"maxOptimizeSegments\" option which allows an integer to be specified resulting in a \"partial optimize\" down to that number of segments.\n\nThis requires clients to have some visibility into the current number of segments. Client code could be simpler if there was an easy way to just say \"make it smaller by some amount\"  \n\nI propose that we start supporting negative numbers and percentages as a way of saying \"optimize down to X segments less then the current value\" or \"optimize down to X% of the current value\"  This could be used by \"dumb\" automatic monitors when they notice that update traffic is low, or system resources are idle, w/o those monitors needing to inspect the index to pick a good concrete number of segments.",
