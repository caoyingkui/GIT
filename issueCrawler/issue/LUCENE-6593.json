    "description": "ToChildBlockJoinScorer fails if you advance it on a parent document. While this was fine if you wrapped it in a FilteredQuery, it is not if you wrap it in a BooleanQuery because of its approximation support: it can be advanced to a document that has been returned by the approximation of another clause but not confirmed yet. So ToChildBlockJoinScorer should accept any valid doc ID as a target.",
