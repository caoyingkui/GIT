            "content": "Hi Lewis,\nunfortunately, your patch is not enough! Lucene does not use transitive dependecies anywhere. So when you update TIKA, you also have to verify the dependencies of TIKA and update the other versions listed in ivy-versions.xml to the ones that are required by TIKA (e.g. PDFBOX, ROME,...). Not doing this will make the tests of the contrib/extraction module to fail.\n\nTo test the upgrade, you must run \"ant test\" inside the contrib/extraction module.\n\nPlease also make sure to update PDFBOX to one newer than the one required by TIKA, because we need the BUG in PDFBOX to be fixed, that makes it not work with Java 9 (Lucene and Solr tests must pass with Java 9 previews). The version currently shipped with TIKA 1.12 is broken, unfortunately.\n\nThe hard part in updating is:\n\n\tYou have to be sure that you don't upgrade a library required by TIKA that Solr needs in another/older version (there are several ones). We generally disable those parsers that require incorrect versions.\n\tIf you really need to upgrade some library required for TIKA and we must update Solr's shared one, it gets complicated and needs a lot of testing, so it should generally be avoided. This is the reason why TIKA gets updated sparingly in Solr. The dependency-hell as introduced by TIKA is horrible for us to manage - in fact its a desaster!\n\n\n\n\nTrivial update. @uschindler I attempted running ant test locally with the following failures\n   [junit4] Suite: org.apache.solr.search.TestSolrJ\n   [junit4] Completed [579/579 (6!)] on J3 in 0.02s, 1 test\n   [junit4]\n   [junit4]\n   [junit4] Tests with failures [seed: 64AD6FE9325CC7B0]:\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.TestRequestStatusCollectionAPI.test\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.DistribCursorPagingTest.test\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.DeleteLastCustomShardedReplicaTest.test\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.SimpleCollectionCreateDeleteTest.test\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.TestMiniSolrCloudCluster.testSegmentTerminateEarly\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.TestMiniSolrCloudCluster.testStopAllStartAll\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.TestMiniSolrCloudCluster.testCollectionCreateWithoutCoresThenDelete\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.cloud.TestMiniSolrCloudCluster.testCollectionCreateSearchDelete\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.handler.admin.CoreAdminHandlerTest.testDeleteInstanceDir\n   [junit4]   - org.apache.solr.handler.admin.CoreAdminHandlerTest (suite)\n   [junit4]\n   [junit4]\n   [junit4] JVM J0:     0.60 ..   655.76 =   655.16s\n   [junit4] JVM J1:     0.85 ..   656.59 =   655.74s\n   [junit4] JVM J2:     0.85 ..   200.28 =   199.44s\n   [junit4] JVM J3:     0.60 ..  1037.32 =  1036.72s\n   [junit4] Execution time total: 17 minutes 17 seconds\n   [junit4] Tests summary: 579 suites (8 ignored), 2331 tests, 2 suite-level errors, 8 errors, 1 failure, 1320 ignored (59 assumptions)\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/usr/local/lucene-solr/build.xml:59: The following error occurred while executing this line:\n/usr/local/lucene-solr/solr/build.xml:233: The following error occurred while executing this line:\n/usr/local/lucene-solr/solr/common-build.xml:524: The following error occurred while executing this line:\n/usr/local/lucene-solr/lucene/common-build.xml:1457: The following error occurred while executing this line:\n/usr/local/lucene-solr/lucene/common-build.xml:1014: There were test failures: 579 suites (8 ignored), 2331 tests, 2 suite-level errors, 8 errors, 1 failure, 1320 ignored (59 assumptions) [seed: 64AD6FE9325CC7B0]\n\nTotal time: 34 minutes 7 seconds\n\n\n\nThese are unrelated failures in the Solr core module. You should run tests in contrib/extraction only as a start. Fixing your whole test setup to make everything work can be done afterwards.\n\nI assume you never ran tests in contrib/extraction, because it failed already before. I am quite sure that contrib/extraction will fail completely because of the non-yet updated dependencies. ",

We also exclude purely scientific formats like Netcdf, not useable to \"normal\" endusers. If you really need those libraries, users can add the JARs on their own. We don't want to bloat the binary release with stuff useless to 99.9% of all users.\n\nIn general we are mostly interested in libraries that extract text from \"documents\", not stuff that just extracts a bit of metadata or other non-document stuff. So I have the feeling Apache SIS is not relevant for the extraction module. Users that want to index geospatial stuff have to use other features of Solr.\n\nFor the other new dependencies, we have to add the NOTICE.txt entries (inside Solr). ",

I committed this locally, so not sure how to proceed.
