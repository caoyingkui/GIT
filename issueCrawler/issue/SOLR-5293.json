    "description": "I'd like to request the support for the setting of HTTP headers on SolrCloud sub-requests (super-requests that result in an internal sub-request in SolrCloud).\n\nI would like to be able to set an HTTP header in 2 ways:\n\n\tCopy headers (a specific list?) from super-request -> sub-request. (default behavior)\n\tProvide a sub-request HTTP header as a JVM param or in solr.xml. (failback from default behavior)\n\n\n\nThis would also help resolve SOLR-4470 in a more agnostic (any HTTP header) way.",
