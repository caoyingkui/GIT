    "description": "This constant is currently not used and from what I understand, it was used in the past to test 3.x stuff? Anyway, I want to revive it by renaming it to OLD_FORMAT_IMPERSONATION_IS_ACTIVE (defaults to true) and have the RWCodecs respect it by not supporting e.g. fieldsConsumer() if it's set to false. This will allow tests that want to verify e.g. old formats are not supported work.\n\nCurrently it's impossible because the RWCodec gets loaded before the non-RW by SPI, and so writing segments in an old format always work. I want to test something like that in LUCENE-5189 and prevents it.\n\nWill post a patch soon.",

What I see is that Lucene41RWCodec is used, and it succeeds to write a posting. The reason is that Lucene41PostingsFormat is the latest and so still 'valid'. But it's confusing that Lucene41Codec can be used to write postings, yet not DocValues, just because the postings format hasn't changed. Is that a bug or should I modify the test to allow \"Lucene41\" and \"Lucene42\" to write postings? ",
