    "description": "On LUCENE-2957, Uwe wrote:\n\nxml-apis.jar is not needed with xerces-2.9 and Java 5, as Java 5 already has these interface classes (JAXP 1.3). Xerces 2.11 needs it, because it ships with Java 6's JAXP release (containing STAX & Co. not available in Java 5).\n\nOn the #lucene IRC channel, Uwe also wrote:\n\nsince we are on java 5 since 3.0\nwe have the javax APIs already available in the JVM\nxerces until 2.9.x only needs JAXP 1.3\nso the only thing you need is xercesImpl.jar\nand serializer.jar\nserializer.jar is shared between all apache xml projects, dont know the exact version number\nok you dont need it whan you only parse xml\nas soon as you want to serialize a dom tree or result of an xsl transformation you need it\n[...]\nbut if we upgrade to latest xerces we need it [the xml-apis jar] again unless we are on java 6\nso the one shipped with xerces 2.11 is the 1.4 one\nbecause xerces 2.11 supports Stax",
