    "description": "Some time ago I along with Robert and Uwe, wrote an Stemmer which uses the Hunspell algorithm.  It has the benefit of supporting dictionaries for a wide array of languages.   \n\nIt seems to still be being used but has fallen out of date.  I think it would benefit from being inside the analysis module where additional features such as decompounding support, could be added.",

            "content": "+1\n\nWe now use Lucene Hunspell for a few customer deployments, and it would be great to have it the analysis module, since it supports some 70-80 languages out of the box, and gives great flexibility since you can edit - or augment - the dictionaries to change behaviour and fix stemming bugs.\n\nAs a side benefit I also expect that when the Ooo dictionaries get more use in Lucene, users will over time be able to extend and improve the dictionaries, and contribute their changes back, benefiting also Ooo users.
