            "content": "A few comments on the patch:\n\n\n\tSolrMBeanTest fails with this patch due to the description and source being null\n\tI don't think we want/need member variables for ids and idScores, as it won't be thread safe. I'd just loop the DocIterator once, building a StringBuilder and then calling addToLog on that StringBuilder. This will also avoid the need for clone()\n\tFor the scores, let's just do an output of id:score, id:score, ...   Using a Map won't be reliable, as we will want to maintain order in the log.\n\tFor the log key, let's just call it the same thing which should simplify parsing, regardless of whether there are scores present or not, so the format would be: responseLog: id1[:score1],id2[:score2],...  where [ ] is used to indicate it is optional.\n\tWe should follow the normal SearchComponent pattern of being able to turn on/off the component via a request parameter.  \n\nif (!params.getBool(COMPONENT_NAME, false)) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n  This component should be OFF by default.\n\tIn the ResponseLogComponentTest, do we need the createCore() stuff?  See some of the other tests and how they use initCore.\n\n "
