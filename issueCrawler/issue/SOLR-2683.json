    "description": "When I launch Solr and the core's instanceDir does not exist, the directory is created, but none of the JARs listed in solrconfig.xml in <lib> entries are added to the classpath, thus resulting in ClassNotFound exceptions at runtime.\n\n<lib> entries in solrconfig.xml are relative to core's instanceDir. It seems that <lib> entries are processed before instanceDir is created and therefore can't be resolved. \n\nExample solr.xml:\n\n  <cores adminPath=\"/admin/cores\" defaultCoreName=\"master1\">\n    <core name=\"master1\" instanceDir=\"master1\" shard=\"shard1\">\n    </core>  \n    <core name=\"master2\" instanceDir=\"master2\" shard=\"shard2\">\n    </core>  \n  </cores>\n\nsolrconfig.xml:\n  ...\n  <lib dir=\"../../dist\" />\n  ...",
