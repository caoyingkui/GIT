The initial patch includes banded queries that were also proposed on the original issue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have one outstanding questions:\n\n\tShould the score from the overall query be normalised?\n\n\n\nNote, that the band count is currently approximate and may be one less than in practise.",

LUCENE-6968 mentioned above appears to be in 7.0 but perhaps there are other dependencies? During the Lucene Hackday in Montreal Andy Hind explained a little on what this logic is about and I think this could be of interest to folks on the upcoming 7.6 release too.\n\n\n\n\n\tIs the intended use case for this query parser primarily direct e.g. via the q and fq parameters or indirect somehow e.g. via streaming expressions? If the use case is direct:\n\t\n\t\tthe parser could potentially be given a default name of (say) minhash and included in the standard plugins i.e. https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/7.5.0/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/search/QParserPlugin.java#L46\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUsers (and tests) would not need to configure <queryParser name=\"minhash\" class=\"org.apache.solr.search.MinHashQParserPlugin\" /> then.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tthe parser could be included in the Solr Reference Guide e.g. the http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_5/other-parsers.html section which is https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/7.5.0/solr/solr-ref-guide/src/other-parsers.adoc in version control.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe solr/CHANGES.txt entry lacks the customary attribution, just an oversight I'm sure and easily fixed.\n\n ",

A default wire up would be great.\n\nI would not be surprised if someone comes up with a use in streaming as it provides another distance measure.\n\nI will look at adding the docs.

It is subsequently \"rehashed\" `hashCount` times by combining with a set of precomputed hashes.\nFor each of the resulting hashes, the hash space is divided in to `bucketCount` buckets. The lowest set of `hashSetSize` hashes (usually a set of one)\nis generated for each bucket.\n\nThis filter generates one type of signature or sketch for the input tokens and can be used to compute Jaccard similarity between documents.\n\n\nArguments:\n\n`hashCount`:: (integer) the number of hashes to use. The default is 1.\n\n`bucketCount`:: (integer) the number of buckets to use. The default is 512.\n\n`hashSetSize`:: (integer) the size of the set for the lowest hashes from each bucket. The default is 1.\n\n`withRotation`:: (boolean) if a hash bucket is empty, generate a hash value from the first previous bucket that has a value.\n The default is true if the bucket count is greater than 1 and false otherwise.\n\n\nThe number of hashes generated depends on the options above. With the default settings for `withRotation`, the number of hashes geerated is\n`hashCount` x `bucketCount` x `hashSetSize` => 512, by default.\n\nExample:\n\n[source,xml]\n\n<analyzer>\n <tokenizer class=\"solr.ICUTokenizerFactory\"/>\n <filter class=\"solr.ICUFoldingFilterFactory\"/>\n <filter class=\"solr.ShingleFilterFactory\" minShingleSize=\"5\" outputUnigrams=\"false\" outputUnigramsIfNoShingles=\"false\" maxShingleSize=\"5\" tokenSeparator=\" \"/>\n <filter class=\"org.apache.lucene.analysis.minhash.MinHashFilterFactory\" bucketCount=\"512\" hashSetSize=\"1\" hashCount=\"1\"/>\n</analyzer>\n\n\nIn: \"woof woof woof woof woof\"\n\nTokenizer to Filter: \"woof woof woof woof woof\"\n\nOut: \"\u2101\ud33d\u5fad\u8059\u219d\ua1c1\ud671\u676f\", \"\u2101\ud33d\u5fad\u8059\u219d\ua1c1\ud671\u676f\", \"\u2101\ud33d\u5fad\u8059\u219d\ua1c1\ud671\u676f\", .... a total of 512 times\n\n{quote]\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 ",
