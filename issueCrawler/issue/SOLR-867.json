But the problem with the solution is that you end up serializing all those objects and deserializing them. \n\nIf I am not wrong , we only need to recursively go through the NamedList  and replace all Doclist and Document with SolrDocumentList and SolrDocument . Every other object remains same at both ends of the pipe. \n\nSo you can reuse the getDoc() method but you may need to replicate the writeDocList() method into  a getDocList() method.\n "
