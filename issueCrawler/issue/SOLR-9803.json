    "description": "I was doing some stress testing for creating/deleting collections to see if SOLR-7936 was still a problem when I noticed memory creep. I'll attach the program I was using, but basically it creates/deletes a collection over and over.\n\nA little while after it starts, org.apache.solr.update.VersionBucket instances are\nbytes           instances\n18M            786K\n\nThen after 300+ iterations the numbers are:\nbytes          instances\n506M               21M\n\njconsole shows an increasing heap usage as well.\n\nWhether the Solr node is an overseer or not is irrelevant.\nTim Potter you might have some insight here?\n\nI also have no idea whether this more widespread than creating/deleting collections, it just happens that that was the test I was running when I saw this.\n\nI saw this on trunk, I assume 6x shows it too.",
