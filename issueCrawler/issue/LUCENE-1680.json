    "description": "PrefixTermEnum#difference() offers a way to influence scoring based on the difference between the prefix Term and a term in the enumeration. To effectively use this facility the length of the prefix should be accessible to subclasses. Currently the prefix term is private to PrefixTermEnum. I added a getter for the prefix length and made PrefixTermEnum#endEnum(), PrefixTermEnum#termCompare() final for consistency with other TermEnum subclasses.\n\nPatch is attached.\n\nSimon",
