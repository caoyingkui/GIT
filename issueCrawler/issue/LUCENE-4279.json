    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-3841 (and several threads on the list)\n\nCurrently each SnowballStemmer is pretty heavy since each instance also contains a bunch of Among objects (part of the stemming rules).\n\nThis normally shouldnt be a problem, except it seems challenging\nfor tomcat users to tune their threadpools (basically they are creating\nlots of tokenstreams, so lots of SnowballStemmers)\n\nNewer snowball just makes these static, and its easy enough to just\nregenerate so these aren't so heavy, it doesnt fix the real problem but it also doesn't hurt.",
