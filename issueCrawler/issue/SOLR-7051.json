    "description": "Solr Suggester support a payload that can be returned as part of the response. Currently DocumentDictionaryFactory will fetch the payload from one stored field on the document being processed.\n\nIt is, however, quite common that the client needs a payload with information from several document fields and possibly some calculations etc.\n\nInvestigate whether we could support a scriptable payload, e.g.\n\n<str name=\"payloadScript\">\"type=\" + doc['typefield'] + \";color=\" + doc['colorfield'] + \";sum=\" + (doc['a_i']+doc['b_i'])</str>",
