    "description": "My problem is that i have documents containing a numeric value and a unit like this:\n\nweight:100g\n\nweight:1000kg\n\nAnd i want to make querys like this:\n\nweight:[5g TO 100KG]\n\nOf course this doent work as easy as it sounds, the values are saved as strings. I did some research and came up with this\u00a0https://dzone.com/articles/build-a-custom-solr-filter-to-handle-unit-conversions.\n\nThis worked out pretty well, i can search for: weight:100000g and get results containing weight:100kg, nice. But i cant figure out how to extend this, to make a range-search possible",
