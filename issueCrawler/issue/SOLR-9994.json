            "content": "At first I was confused what Points has to do with CollapseQParser since collapsing should be on DocValues, not on an index (be it Terms or Points) but now I understand that it's still DocValues, it's just that the collapse doesn't know about these new field types.  I wonder if these features that need to detect the DocValues type might be improved by introducing some method on FieldType that returns the Int/Long/Float/Double interpretation of the numeric DocValues, assuming the field even has numeric DocValues?  The result would be reducing instanceof checks (usually a good thing) which also allows for more flexibility of user defined special numeric fields.  Heck you could even collapse on an enum field then. ",
