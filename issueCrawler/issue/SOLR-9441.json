    "description": "When we backup Solr collection using HDFS backup repository, the backup folder (and the files) are created with permissions 755 (i.e. only solr process owner can delete/move the backup folder). This is inconvenient from user perspective since the backup is essentially a full-copy of the Solr collection and hence manipulating it doesn't affect the Solr collection state in any way.\n\nWe should provide an option by which we can enable other users to manipulate the backup folders.",
