    "description": "The current tests for SqlEntityProcessor (& CachedSqlEntityProcessor), while many, do not reliably fail when bugs are introduced!  They are also difficult to look at and understand.  As we move Jenkins onto new environments, we have found several of them fail regularly leading to \"@Ignore\".  \n\nMy aim here is to write all new tests for (Cached)SqlEntityProcessor, and to document (hopefully fix) any bugs this reveals.",

(3.5 is the latest version prior to SOLR-2382 and other changes that may have caused undetected bugs, so its a good \"control case\")\n\nThis first patch only replaces the \"full-import\" tests.
