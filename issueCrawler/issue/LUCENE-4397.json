In Eclipse it took 316 seconds (while ant test was still running the rest of the tests.)\n\nOn trunk, TestIndexWriterWithThreads took 90 seconds.\n ",

            "content": "It's weird, the variance on this test is indeed very high. I think it may have something to do with the fact that it spins many threads (that do i/o) so if you're running on a multicore and there are other parallel jvms running tests you're putting a load on the hardware. If ran in isolation things get much faster (for me).\n\nI've replaced some of the random() calls with the non-asserting random; I see some difference but not that much. ",
