            "content": "Here is a patch. It is large due to the move of files but quite simple:\n\n\tThe org.apache.lucene.legacy package, which contains legacy numerics, has been moved to org.apache.solr.legacy under solr/core\n\tPointVectorStrategy has been copied to org.apache.lucene.legacy since Solr sometimes uses it in conjunction with legacy numerics\n\tSupport for legacy numerics has been removed from the spatial-extras package\n\n\n\nI also attached a -short patch which I created with the -M option so that it does not show file moves, hopefully that makes reviews easier.
