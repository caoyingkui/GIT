            "content": "Hm, while a read this the first time .. i thought this might be an easy fix, but it's kind of \"did you mean recursion?\" ;o\n\nActually, if you go to \"/solr\" the server redirects you to \"/solr/\" (because it's a directory), the UI is loaded and initially it goes to \"/solr/#/\" as starting-point, where the UI is mounted to. \n\nSo, in fact you're going back (from \"/solr/#/\" to \"/solr/\") which will give you the 404 right now, because we did not catch this. but if we will .. the UI will redirect you back forward (hopefully you got this? *g) to \"/solr/#/\" .\n\nI already mentioned this on SOLR-4439, what about changing the node's target to the same page you're actually on for the other node? so to say \"http://solr1/#/~cloud\" goes to \"http://solr2/#/~cloud\" or (if you're viewing the radial graph) from \"http://solr1/#/~cloud?view=rgraph\" to \"http://solr2/#/~cloud?view=rgraph\" "
