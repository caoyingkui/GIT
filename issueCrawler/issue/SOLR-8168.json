    "description": "Spinoff from http://search-lucene.com/m/l6pAi1ghxBm21t0a2\n\nOn the Solr web site http://lucene.staging.apache.org/solr/features.html we list key features.\nNow with 5.3 out the door, I think one of those icons should be about security. Proposed text: \n\nTitle: Security built right in\nSubtitle: Secure Solr with Authentication, Role based Authorization and SSL. Pluggable, of course!\n\nWe could design a new icon for security, but instead, here's a suggestion to repurpose the existing ones:\n\n\tRemove the \"External configuration\" part - not very impressive anymore \n\tInstead use the \"External config\" icon for the \"Schema-less feature\".\n\tUse the \u201cschemaless\" icon (with a key) as the new security icon\n\n\n\nSee how it looks here: http://www.cominvent.com/solr/Apache%20Solr%20-%20Features.html",
