Also, the Locale bug with DateFormatEvaluator is solved.  Instead of using the machine default, the Root Locale is used by default.  An optional 3rd parameter allows users to specify whatever locale they want.",

Tests need to be changed to take advantage first though. "

            "content": "Dominik,\n\nThank you for reporting this!  Could you post your data-config.xml so I can get an idea of which features you're using?  Are these full or delta imports?  Are you using DateFormatEvaluator ( ${dataimporter.functions.formatDate(...) ) ? \n\nThis issue involved extensive rework to the VariableResolver(Impl) class, and to the Evaluator framework, with the aim on making the code easier to understand and to maintain.  Whenever this type of change is made, it is always possible that the new implementation will suffer performance-wise.  I will look with you on this: We certainly do not want massive performance decreases to get released.   \n\nOne thing that jumps out at me is the old version stored a cache of parsed-out template strings (ex: ${foo.bar} ) in a HashMap.  I was worried that this could potentially consume too much memory and changed this to a WeakHashMap.  But if your JVM is clearing out these WeakReferences frequently it might require a lot more work to keep re-parsing these strings.  \n\nAnother problem could be with DateFormatEvaluator.  It used to keep a single instance of SimpleDateFormat (per-thread) and always use that as the \"from-date-format\" but now that Locales are involved this doesn't work.  To alleviate this it only creates one Dateformat per pattern/locale combination and caches these, also in a WeakHashMap.  This also might suffer from WeakReferences going away, but more seriously, I think having this map as an instance variable here entirely defeats its purpose if the VariableResolver is creating a new instance each time it is being used.  So I need to look into that.\n\nprobably the biggest change is DateFormatEvaluator "

            "content": "Dominik,\n\nI've been testing the new DIH code with my data and if anything the newer version seems slightly faster than the older one (I'm comparing the latest snapshot with one from a couple of months ago, but I only updated the DIH jar so as to isolate DIH changes).   I then disabled the WeakHashMap in VariableResolver and tried again and it didn't seem to be much slower, if any (makes me wonder if caching here at all is misguided).  Now I'm running it with a TemplateTransformer on a child entity that has multiple children per parent and it still doesn't seem to have slowed down.  (The changes with this issue could have dramatically slowed TemplateTransformer if I made a mistake...)  The data I'm indexing has about 50 child entities so the VariableResolver gets plenty of exercise matching keys with the parent.  I also wonder that because you're seeing slowdowns of 3x of what you had before if perhaps something else isn't going on?  I doubt DIH's overhead is nearly enough to cause something like that.\n\nCan you try and narrow the cause down?  Here are the steps I would take:\n\n\trevert back to the old Solr & DIH and re-index.  Verify you get the old \"good\" performance back.\n\tJust upgrade DIH and not the rest of Solr.  Verify the performance is \"bad\" again, and that the cause is something in DIH.\n\tIf in DIH, try eliminating 1 feature at a time:\n\tTry it without use of TemplateTransformer.\n\tTry it without evaluators.\n\tTry eliminating child entities to see if one particular child is causing the difficulties\n\n\n\nIf this is indeed caused by DIH changes, it is something that you use that I am not testing (properly or at all) on my end.
