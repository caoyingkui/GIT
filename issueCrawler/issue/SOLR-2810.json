    "description": "The LBHttpSolrServer should be made configurable how to react to (certain) HTTP errors.\n\nIn my opinion, all errors that are caused by infrastructure instead of an erroneous request/query, should cause the server to get taken out of rotation, instead of rethrowing the exception. \nFor example, if for some reason the server responds with a 404 or a 503, etc. (maybe because the webapp could not be deployed after a restart), this should not cause the user to see an error message as long as there are other solr servers available.",
