    "description": "In an IRC discussion with Robert Muir, it has come up that the names of certain classes and methods in the search package do not describe the role of the class or method in question. Therefore, we propose the following name changes:\n\n\tScorer to Matcher\n\tSimilarity.computeWeight() to Similarity.computeStats()\n\tSimilarity.DocScorer to Similarity.Scorer*\n\n\n\n*: Under consideration.\n\nThe reason for the name computeStats() is that this method will be used by the new Similarity subclasses to compute all the statistics they need, not just idf.",
