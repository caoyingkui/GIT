    "description": "The API of CheckIndex changed. The Check function returns a CheckIndexStatus and not boolean. And JavaDocs notes the boolean return value.\n\nI am not sure if it works, but it would be good to have the check method that returns boolean available @Deprecated, i.e.\n@Deprecated public static CheckIndexStatus check(Directory dir, boolean doFix) throws IOException {\n final CheckIndexStatus stat=this.check(dir,doFix);\n return stat.clean;\n}\n\nI am not sure, if it can be done with the same method name, but it prevents drop-in-replacements of Lucene to work.",

            "content": "I did not realize about LUCENE-1354, so I am a little bit late with my concerns. In my opinion, the way how CheckIndex is implemented, is not the cleanest obect-oriented way. It looks like a standard console program, what it was at the beginning, but not like a tool for use in other tools (like startup or maintenance tasks of Solr or my project panFMP). There is one problem:\n\nWe have a static variable pointing to the output Stream. As this variable is static, it is everywhere the same. If I want to create a web application that checks two indexes and this maybe in parallel (because two users started the check index task), I cannot redirect the output stream to an individual \"console\" (e.g. the servlet output stream).\n\nIn my opinion, to be a handy tool, there should be some minor changes:\n\n\tthe class should have an public constructor getting the Directory\n\ta public method to set the output stream for the instance (like IndexWriter does with setInfoStream())\n\tthe check/fix methods as instance methods\n\n\n\nThe main() method (which must stay static, which is clear) and the two static and deprecated methods, should instantiate an CheckIndex instance and call the methods using System.err ",

For more detailed status info, look into instance variables. ",
