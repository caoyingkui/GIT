            "content": "That node is pretty much used for internal communication and not for external visibility. It's used for the marking and consuming of the response internally.\nThat 3 min TIMEOUT is the http timeout and even though the request said it timeout (the parent request did), the internal requests would most likely have gone through. That's the case with a lot of long running Collection API calls.\nI'd recommend you ask such questions on the mailing list before creating a JIRA.  I'm closing this one out for now.\n\nP.S: For long running collection API calls, check out the ASYNC mode of the calls. At the same time, I'm not sure if ASYNC support for RELOAD exists at this time. If it doesn't feel free to create a JIRA for that one. "
