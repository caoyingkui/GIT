So all methods should be final, at least all methods that access/modify the private maps.\n\nA correct plan for \"own implementations of AttributeSource\" would be to create an abstract AttributeSource base class that defines the behaviour and all impls in the current AttributeSource are final. Because there may be other implementations that work without maps or have a hardcoded number of attributes with optimized implementations. ",

            "content": "Ok I see. I think that instead of creating another class to introduce new users to, we can stick w/ AS and make all the methods that no one shouldn't have any reason to ever extend final. We can keep the methods that define the 'behavior' not final, though I don't see any at the moment. Maybe getAttributeImplsIterator.\n\nBut if will make sense to factor out just these methods to a separate class, so that custom AS don't need to be a sub-class of AS for just that purpose, then I think it'll also be ok.
