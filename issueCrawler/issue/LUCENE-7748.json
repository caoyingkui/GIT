    "description": "I wrote on the 6.4.1 release vote thread:\n\n\nOne minor problem with both Changes.html files: there is no release date on the 6.4.0 release section.  The 6.4.0 release section was never added to the DOAP files under dev-tools/doap/ on branch_6_4.  I\u2019ll think about a way of automating a test to prevent this in the future.  In the meantime, I\u2019ll add a reminder to sanity check the DOAP files before a release to the ReleaseToDo.",
