            "content": "Here is a patch. There is one case when terms and norms may go out-of-sync: when a document fails indexing eg. because the consumption of the token stream triggers an exception. In such a case you could end up with terms for this document but no norm. Since IndexWriter immediately marks the document as deleted in such a case, the new check only verifies that terms and norms agree on live documents. ",
