            "content": "Koji, what is the advantage of the HTMLStripCharFilter over HTMLStripReader?\nGood question, Shalin \nBecause after LUCENE-1466 committed, all tokenizers can read chars from CharFilter rather than Reader, I'd like to replace Readers like this by CharFilters. Obvious advantages are:\n\n\tWe can use an arbitrary tokenizer, e.g. CJKTokenizer.\n\tWe can use a chain of CharFilters. For example, we can strip HTML tags then normalize chars before tokenizer running.\n\n "
