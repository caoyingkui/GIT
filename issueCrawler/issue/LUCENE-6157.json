            "content": "That would be nice as core keys don't cary any meaning but it felt a bit awkward to implement. For instance, when we evict a filter in order to clear up some space, we don't have a reference to a LeafReader available. So we would need the per-leaf cache to keep a reference to the first used LeafReader and use this instance when performing evictions. But then it means that we might give a reference to a closed LeafReader (if the original leaf reader was closed but there is still another LeafReader sharing the same core because of eg. deletions) in these callbacks? Would it be ok? "
