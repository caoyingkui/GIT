The use of Vector is just a relict from earlier days. I should have removed that for 3.0 already but missed that exactly because I did not know if synchronization was needed. ",

SortedSet only works if the set ordering is defined by its contents, which is not the case for SegmentInfos (the ordering is given by the file on disk). The only thing that could work is combination of List and Set, the Set only to check for duplicates.
