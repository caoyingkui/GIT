    "description": "(From the Mailing List)\n\nIt seems that a facet query does not use the global query parameters (for example, field aliasing for edismax parser).\nWe have an intensive use of facet queries (in some cases, we have a lot of facet.query for a single q), and the using of LocalParams for each facet.query is not convenient.",

            "content": "Clarified on mailing list.\n\nReporter was expecting \"defType\" to be applied to facet.query...\n\n\na top level defType param only applies to the \"q\" param.  This is by \ndesign.  \n\n\"defType\" is special and only applies to hte \"main\" query where it is being evaluated, in order to make it easier to specify the type of parser to use on input straight from end users \u2013 things like fq, facet.query, and any recursively specified query strings (ie: via other nested local params), etc, are not affected by defType.  These other params are almost alway programatically generated, so it's typically easy to use an explicit \"type\" local param to change the parser they use (if they looked at defType it would cause all sorts of confusing behavior for most users who just wanted to cahnge the parser for the main query) "
