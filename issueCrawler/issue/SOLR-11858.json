This:\n\t\n\t\tCreates a collection with the sample_techproducts_config with spellcheck defaults that seem to match with what  you used\n\t\tIndexes exampledocs\n\t\n\t\n\tThen I did a query for \"aple\" to the /spell requestHandler: http://localhost:8654/solr/techproducts/spell?q=aple\n\tI got 1 result as expected for that dataset (\"apple\").\n\n\n\nCan you correct these steps or add any additional information to try to reproduce this?

Apparently, that is not the only requirement for the problem to occur.\n\nWhen i reported this issue. it was the first time saw it, and the last time so far. In the mean time we had plenty of times where there was a misspelling and more than 0 results.\n\nSo i must apologize, i have no idea how to reproduce it in any consistent manner.\n\nBut let's leave it open for now so others can find it.

We should add some parameter checks to lucene so that you get a good exception instead.\n\nAs far as the solr code calling it, thats a separate issue... i have no idea, because i don't know much about this SpellingOptions, but one of the values in question defaults to zero...
