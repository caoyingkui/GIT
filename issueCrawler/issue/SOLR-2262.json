    "description": "Config and schema links from the admin page do not work with Tomcat 7.  Apparently Tomcat 7 doesn't like the extra slash in the URL: file/? and returns a 404.  Removing the extra / resolves the problem.\n\nDoes not work:\nhttp://localhost:8080/solr/admin/file/?file=schema.xml\n\nWorks:\nhttp://localhost:8080/solr/admin/file?file=schema.xml\n\nI stumbled across a blog post that provides a bit more detail.  http://androidyou.blogspot.com/2010/09/tomcat-7-with-solr-14-http-status-404.html",

Returns any extra path information associated with the URL the client\nsent when it made this request. The extra path information follows the servlet path but \nprecedes the query string and will start with a \"/\" character. \n\n\n "
