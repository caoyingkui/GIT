    "description": "In case a split finds that previous sub-shards exist in construction or recovery state. it tries to clean them up by invoking deleteshard API. However, the clean up logic tries to invoke deleteshard on the same sub-shards as many times as the requested number of sub-ranges. Such repeat calls to deleteshard fail and therefore fail the entire shard split operation.",
