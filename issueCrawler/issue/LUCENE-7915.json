I've felt this way many times when I see trivial refactorings \u2013 typically that my IDE suggests.  But I've not done so because I figured we were more adamant about the JIRA process here.  I'll go ahead and commit when I see little refactoring improvements then.  There's still the pain of back-porting as an impediment though. ",
