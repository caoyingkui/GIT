    "description": "I want to setup a rule like to the effect of - Each shard should have their replicas distributed equally amongst availability zones\n\nFor achieveing this today I can create a rule like this\n\n{\"replica\": \"#EQUAL\", \"shard\": \"#EACH\", \"sysprop.az\": \u201c#EACH\u201d}\n\nAnd then make sure that every solr jvm starts up with a system property called \"az\"\n\nAnother user might call the same property \"availability_zone\" and for some it's just a different \"rack\"\n\nAll of them want to achieve the same goal of redundancy\n\nSo if we have a well kown property called \"rack\" it would help standardize documentation , examples given out during talks etc.",
