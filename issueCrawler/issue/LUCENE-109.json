    "description": "I've just discovered that IndexSearcher.close() should not be called while you \nare still using the Hits objects returned from IndexSearcher.search(). [BTW \nusing 1.3-rc1]\n\n\n\n\nThis is intuitive from examining the source to Hits but not from any of the \ndocumentation I've seen, please forgive me if I missed it. It should be very \neasy to change the javadocs on either the Hits class or the IndexSearcher.\nclose() method to mention the above issue. This could save pther newbies such as \nmyself a few hours of pain.\n\n\nThanks",
