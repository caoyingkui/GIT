    "description": "The polygon factory uses a randomize algorithm to find a point inside of the polygon. This might fail, in particular when polygons are very small. I want to propose a small improvement; Before going into the randomize algorithm, we can first try to try a point defined by the center of mass of the provided points. This approach improves things, for example for very small polygons with three points.\n\n\u00a0\n\ndoes it make sense?",
