    "description": "There have been two very recent jenkins failures in TestGroupingSearch whose failure conditions seem to suggest they may be related to the MergePolicy randomization changes made in SOLR-4952, because they depending on exact ordered comparisons of (grouped) results that are not sorted - so differently merged indexes might produce differnet results...\n\nhttps://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201308.mbox/%3C556758084.41.1376060637739.JavaMail.jenkins@serv1.sd-datasolutions.de%3E\n\nhttps://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201308.mbox/%3C1729705091.81.1376255711416.JavaMail.jenkins@serv1.sd-datasolutions.de%3E\n\n...oddly, these failures don't seem to reproduce reliably with the same seed, so rather then just fix the MP as part of SOLR-4952 I'm opening a new linked issue to keep track of this in case additional failures still happen",
