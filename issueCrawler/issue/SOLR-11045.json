    "description": "Currently, if the node contains a replica ( the replica being moved ) go down, then we call moveReplica command for it. That replica will only be removed from states.json. So If that node come back, we will have 2 replicas point to the same dataDir in HDFS.\n\nSo if moveReplica can maintain the same name and coreName for the new replica, we can reuse CloudUtil.checkSharedFSFailoverReplaced() to clean the old one.",

            "content": "Thanks Dat. A few comments:\n\n\tminor nit \u2013 the replica being checked for sharedFS in CloudUtil.checkSharedFSFailoverReplaced is different from the core descriptor being passed to the method. In reality it does not matter because today either all replicas are in shared FS or none but if it ever changes then this could be a tricky bug to find.\n\tIn MoveReplicaHDFSTest, the assertNotSame(replica.getNodeName(), newReplica.getNodeName()); is not correct. assertNotSame checks for object reference equality.\n\tThe test should not extend MoveReplicaTest because then the super class's test() method is also executed as part of this test. Extend SolrCloudTestCase directly.\n\tThe test should assertTrue on the result of ClusterStateUtil.waitForAllActiveAndLiveReplicas(zkStateReader, 120000); call otherwise a timeout is counted as success. On a local run I saw it hang for 2 minutes and yet the test succeeded.\n\n ",
