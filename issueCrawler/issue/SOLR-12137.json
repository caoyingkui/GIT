    "description": "SOLR-11749 introduced a regression suite for the bin/solr scripts.  Currently this suite (located in solr/bin-test only covers the *nix copy of bin/solr.  No tests are run for the Windows version.\n\nThis JIRA involves porting the existing bin-test/test logic (along with the accompanying tests) to Windows batch.  This will allow both versions of the script to be tested, and will open the door to future steps, like hooking the suite into one of ant's test targets.",
