We need to switch this to crawling git instead, but I'm not too familiar with what's happening here ...\n\nMaybe Steve Rowe can help?",

I'll work on it, but I'm afraid it'll likely take me a day or two to finish.  Hopefully that won't substantially delay your target 5.5.0 RC1 timeframe, Michael McCandless. "

I think the most correct would be to take them from the .src.tgz.gz file that was downloaded previously and extracted. This would also be an \"authoritative\" source. The smoker does also not download the full source code from SVN and compares it with the TGZ files, so why does it do it for POMs? In both cases the src.tgz file is enough. The change to fix this should not be to hard, because the src.tgz was already extracted by smoker (the one of Solr is ideal, as it contains everything). Unfortunately my very very very limited / not existing Python knowledge does not allow me to fix this \n\nThe other stuff like Maven artifact processing should indeed work as usual. I am not 100% sure why the nightly smoke in Jenkins works, but I think it may work because the branches are still in SVN (just older versions). "
