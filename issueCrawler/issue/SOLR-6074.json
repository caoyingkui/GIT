    "description": "I was looking into a search not working from the frontend and I wanted to check on how the data was inserted. I was unable to run any proper query that provides useful results other than :.\n\nEven more, when I followed the links from the schema browser from the Top Results for the field I was interested in querying, I was redirected to the query and again no results although there's obviously some because they appear as top results on the search page.\n\nBy speaking with steffkes in #irc, he pointed out that the field name in question had a colon in its name, like:\n\n\"fieldname:name\"\n\nSo the search ended up being\n\nq=fieldname:name:DATA\n\nHe suggested to escape the colon as fieldname\\:name, but that made no difference.\n\nIn the end, there was a setting in the drupal plugin I am using (https://drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) that mentioned about cleaning the field ids to remove that colon in the field name, which I tried, and then I coiuld properly use the web ui to query results. New field name is fieldname$name.\n\nI quote a bit of the README from that module related to this:\n\n\"This will change the Solr field names used for all\n  fields whose Search API identifiers contain a colon (i.e., all nested fields)\n  to support some advanced functionality, like sorting by distance, for which\n  Solr is buggy when using field names with colons.\n\"",

            "content": "There are still no well defined list of characters formally supported in field names. Normally you're advised to stick to a-z0-9 as well as underscore or dash, but it will most often work with a lot of strange chars, but you may see some components fail while other works.\n\nSome known limitation is e.g. spaces not allowed in function queries, and fields cannot start with \"-\" since that will be parsed as NOT in a query etc etc. I'm pretty sure that \":\" will cause trouble in far more places than the UI, so simply stay away from it.\n\nPerhaps this JIRA should result in an updated documentation on supported field name recommendation?
