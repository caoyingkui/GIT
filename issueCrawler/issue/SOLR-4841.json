Without that it is impossible to create owne class extending LanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor.\n\nLanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor base class needs detectLanguage(String content) function to return listy of DetectedLanguage's but you cannot create such objects because constructor is accessible only in same package (org.apache.solr.update.processor).",
