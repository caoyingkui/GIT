    "description": "From digging into LUCENE-6576:\n\nWe use a 32-bit CRC but store it in 64-bits, but today 32 bits are unused. We should check this on both read and write and if bits are invalid (because something is wrong in the JVM, or because on-disk stuff just got corrupted in that way), deliver a good exception.",
