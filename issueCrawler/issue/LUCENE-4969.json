    "description": "OrdinalMap (LUCENE-4795, SOLR-4490) lets you trade off reopen time for faster faceting: it maps per-segment ordinals to a \"global\" space based on deviation from expected deltas.\n\nWe could add a sort comparator to the sandbox or similar that uses this, especially in the case you are using this for faceting anyway: you can then safely offload all terms bytes to disk (DiskDV) and still have performant sorting and faceting.",
