    "description": "I was looking at the DirectPostingsFormat to see exactly what it's doing when you I seekExact().  It does a plain binary search every time, even if I've positioned the state well into size of the array.  A comment (probably left by Michael McCandless) shows that he too knows this could be done smarter:\n\n        // TODO: we should use the skip pointers; should be\n        // faster than bin search; we should also hold\n        // & reuse current state so seeking forwards is\n        // faster\n\n\n\nThis issue represents resolving that TODO so it's isn't forgotten.\n\nFor inspiration about solving this in a smarter way, see Solr's SortedIntDocSet which avoids binary search using an approach that could be borrowed for this codec.",
