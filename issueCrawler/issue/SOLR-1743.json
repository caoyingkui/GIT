We don't handle that setting correctly with MultiCore - we check it by iterating through all of the cores that loaded - but a core with a config erorr wouldn't have loaded ... so abortOnConfigError gets read as false when it should be true.\n\nSo we can fix that, but if you don't want to abortOnConfiguration error, your still going to see this confusing message, so we should prob improve on that as well.

Would be nice to see the error there too, but this is as far as I go at the moment.\n\nThis patch also removes a System.out in the last patch and fixes a bug in reading the defaultCoreName from solr.xml - it was looking for it at /solr when it should have been looking at /solr/cores.\n "

It won't help new users in who start with the current example from the trunk (since it has a solr.xml) but it will get things back to where they were for existing users who try upgrading.\n\nAs i recall one of the patches already posted does this just fine (i just can't remember which one) so that part should be fairly straight forward.
