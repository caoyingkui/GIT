    "description": "This update adds a new super class Index, extended by Directory. It allows for transparent communication between your application and the persistency mechanism. It takes issue 550 one step closer to backwards compability.\n\n\n\tTerm and Document are no longer final classes.\n\tInterfaceIndexWriter\n\n\n\nI also added these two in the Index.\n\n  abstract index.openIndexWriter()\n  abstract index.openIndexReader();\n\nThere is some bonus material that use this:\n\n\n\tDecorators for\n\tIndex\n\tInterfaceIndexWriter\n\tIndexReader\n\tIndexSearcher\n\n\n\n\n\tNotifiableIndex, adds notification of changes to any Index.\n\tCreateListener\n\tDeleteListener\n\tOptimizationListener (not implemented)\n\tContentUpdateListener, reacts to any change of the index. Optimized for some implementations.\n\n\n\n\n\tAutofreshedSearcher, contains a searcher that is always up to date with the index and have a buffer with old searchers that will be closed when nobody is using them anymore (hopefully).",
