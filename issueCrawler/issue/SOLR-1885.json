I stopped it because I need my laptop performance back \n\nPerhaps next I'll try something that uses multiple threads to add to the client, along with more random pauses on the client side to further exercise the connection establish/release code.

This change ensures that a call is made to method.releaseConnection() for every call to executeMethod(method), http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/threading.html. The current version of StreamingUpdateSolrServer only calls releaseConnection once for possibly more than one update call (the posts are wrapped in a do...while block).\n "
