    "description": "Using zabbix to monitor my Solr instance I noticed that after core reloading the Mbeans have disappeared. There is a test -> testJmxIntegration#testJmxOnCoreReload used to check Mbeans presence after core reload. The test is wrong because TestHarness sets core name to null on creating the core for the first time (CoreContainer#initialize) so his Mbeans have jmxRootName=\"solr\" (JmxMonitoredMap#line61). Once the core is created it sets coreName = \"\" causing new Mbeans to have jmxRootName=\"solr/\"\nSo after first core closing only MBeans having name \"solr\" are removed and   only MBeans with name \"solr/\" persists on JMXServer. This test is fake.\n\nStep to reproduce test fail\n1) Apply TestHarness patch\n2) Run the tests",
