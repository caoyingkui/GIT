Sound good...or do you want the glory?\n\nFor the last integration test I did, I put these documents in a directory and ran tika-app.jar against them.  I then ran tika-eval.jar and counted the number of files without exceptions to get a ground truth count of how many files I'd expect to be in Solr.\n\nI then used DIH to import the same directory, with skip on error, and made sure there were the same # of documents in Solr.  This uncovered several problems, which we'll fix in this issue or SOLR-11701.   ",
