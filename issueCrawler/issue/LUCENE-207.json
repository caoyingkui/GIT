Perhaps a check to see if the directory\nexists is in order, and if it doesn't, use a directory you know exists (e.g. a\n/temp directory in the directory created earlier in the create() method).",

Also, in your patch for this, you changed \na message in FSDirectory.create to include the word \"lock\" but it should just \nbe \"Cannot create directory\" in that case since we aren't creating the lock \ndirectory there, we are creating the index directory.

For consistency with java.io.tmpdir, perhaps this\nshould also be relative to PWD.\n\nBut, when both are null, then the lock directory should be the index directory.\n Right now we're attempting to handle this case by using a relative pathname of\n\".\", but perhaps we should handle it more explicitly.
