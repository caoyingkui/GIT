    "description": "The good news is this bug only exists in trunk... the bad news is it's\nbeen here for some time (created by accident in LUCENE-2881).  But the\ngood news is it should strike fairly rarely.\n\nSegmentMerger sometimes incorrectly thinks it can bulk-copy TVs/stored\nfields when it cannot (because field numbers don't map to the same\nnames across segments).\n\nI think it happens only with addIndexes, or indexes that have\npre-trunk segments, and then SM falsely thinks it can bulk-merge only\nwhen the last field number has the same field name across segments.",
