I made some wrong assertions on the fragment size specified which doesn't make sense, was trying to optimise considering the code below in getBreakIterator(String field):\n\n\n312:       if (fragsize <= 1 || baseBI instanceof WholeBreakIterator) { // no real minimum size\n313:         return baseBI;\n314:       }\n\n\n\nI put the piece of code back where it belong. PF the updated patch.\n\nI will also appreciate your inputs on SOLR-10152, CustomSeparatorBreakIterator for PostingsSolrHighlighter.\n\nThanks,\nAmrit Sarkar ",

Thanks again for the contribution.\n\nNow that I think about naming again... hmmm, maybe a more useful/memorable Solr parameter for this might be hl.bs.separatorChar ? I understand why you chose the name you did since it's based on a class name but users don't know/char about that. The \"hl.bs\" namespaces this param as related to the other break iterator related params, which this is.  \"Custom\" is superfluous; we provide it directly via a parameter.  Hmmm; do we even need hl.bs.type==CUSTOM if the user sets hl.bs.separatorChar?  I guess it should be set so that there is consistency in mapping the type to an algorithm.  Though maybe use the value SEPARATOR? And maybe just name this hl.bs.separator to open the door for possibly using an arbitrary length string in the future?\n\nThus I propose hl.bs.type=SEPARATOR with e.g. hl.bs.separator=| ",

CustomSeparatorBreakIterator itself is naming the char 'seperator' in its implementation. \n\nRegarding using string as separator in near future, looking at the CustomSeparatorBreakIterator's code, it seems it can be done with not much effort. I will give it a shot soon. \n\nWe should go with: hl.bs.type=SEPARATOR with e.g. hl.bs.separator=| ",
