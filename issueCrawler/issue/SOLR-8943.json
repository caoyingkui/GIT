    "description": "http://lucene.apache.org/solr/quickstart.html currently says...\n\n\nSolr's install includes a handful of Solr XML formatted files with example data (mostly mocked tech product data). NOTE: This tech product data has a more domain-specific configuration, including schema and browse UI. The bin/solr script includes built-in support for this by running bin/solr start -e techproducts which not only starts Solr but also then indexes this data too (be sure to bin/solr stop -all before trying it out). However, the example below assumes Solr was started with bin/solr start -e cloud to stay consistent with all examples on this page, and thus the collection used is \"gettingstarted\", not \"techproducts\".\n\nBut the assumption at the end of this paragraph \u2013 that the sample techproduct documents can be added to the existing gettingstarted collection \u2013 is fundementally flawed based on how the early sections of the tutorial are written.\n\nWith a completley clean, unused, empty gettingstarted demo collection, bin/post -c gettingstarted example/exampledocs/*.xml does work (on master anyway) but if you have been following along with teh tutorial you don't have a completley empty gettingstarted collection \u2013 you will already have at a minimum the files in \"docs\", but also the user has been enocuraged to index arbitrary files from their computer...\n\n\nIndexing a directory of \"rich\" files\n...\nbin/post -c gettingstarted docs/\n...\nTo index your own data, re-run the directory indexing command pointed to your own directory of documents. For example, on a Mac instead of docs/ try ~/Documents/ or ~/Desktop/ ...\n\n...once the user has done that, it is not safe to assume that the techproduct sample documents can definitely be imported cleanly",
