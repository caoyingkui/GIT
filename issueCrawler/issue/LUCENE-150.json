    "description": "Implementation of the Lucene Directory interface which stores data in a \nJDBC-accessible database.\n\nJune 2nd, 2003, a contribution from \"Anthony Eden\" <me@anthonyeden.com>.\n\n\nOriginal email:\n\nVersion 1.0 of the DBDirectory library, which implements a Directory\nwhich can store indeces in a database is now available for download.\nThere are two versions:\n\n   Tar GZIP:\nhttp://www.anthonyeden.com/download/lucene-dbdirectory-1.0.tar.gz\n   ZIP: http://www.anthonyeden.com/download/lucene-dbdirectory-1.0.zip\n\nThe source code is included.  Please read the README file for\ninstructions on using DBDirectory.  I have only tested it with MySQL \nbut\nwould be happy to add other database scripts if anyone would like to\nsubmit them.  Please post any questions here on the mailing list.\n\nOtis, is there anything left to do to get this into the sandbox?\nAdditionally, how will I maintain the code if it is in the sandbox?\nWill I get write access to the part of the CVS repository which would\nhouse DBDirectory?  I currently have all of the code in my private CVS.\n\nSincerely,\nAnthony Eden",
