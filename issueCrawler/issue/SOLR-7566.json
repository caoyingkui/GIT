            "content": "Shalin Shekhar Mangar thank you. I could reproduce the issue and I have also found the cause of it.\nWhen doing a distributed search, the available shards are taken from the cluster state and are joined together (HttpShardHandler#checkDistributed(ResponseBuilder) method)\nHttpShardHandler#checkDistributed\n// ...\n            StringBuilder sliceShardsStr = new StringBuilder();\n            for (Replica replica : sliceShards.values()) {\n              if (!clusterState.liveNodesContain(replica.getNodeName())\n                  || replica.getState() != Replica.State.ACTIVE) {\n                continue;\n              }\n              if (first) {\n                first = false;\n              } else {\n                sliceShardsStr.append('|');\n              }\n              String url = ZkCoreNodeProps.getCoreUrl(replica);\n              sliceShardsStr.append(url);\n            }\n\n            rb.shards[i] = sliceShardsStr.toString();\n\n\n\nIn the case when the replicas for a shard are not available, the string corresponding to the shard addresses will remain empty.\n\nIn the SearchHandler#handleRequestBody method, the empty shard will be simply forwarded to the HttpShardHandler to be evaluated asynchronously : \nSearchHandler.java line 352\n\nshardHandler1.submit(sreq, shard, params);\n\n\nand in the HttpShardHandler#submit() method will be thrown the exception with an inconsistent message because the shard is empty.\nHttpShardHandler#submit\n          // if there are no shards available for a slice, urls.size()==0\n          if (urls.size()==0) {\n            // TODO: what's the right error code here? We should use the same thing when\n            // all of the servers for a shard are down.\n            throw new SolrException(SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, \"no servers hosting shard: \" + shard);\n          }\n\n\n\n\nOne solution would be to throw the SolrException within the code of HttpShardHandler#checkDistributed method when the sliceShardsStr StringBuilder is empty. This seems to me the easy way to handle this situation.\n\nCan somebody give me feedback whether I am on the right track here? Thanks in advance. ",

When there are no replica urls available there's no more need to submit the callable function.\n\nHttpShardHandler#submit\nfinal List<String> urls = getURLs(sreq, shard);\nif (urls.size()==0) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The shard argument doesn't contain any valid URLs. got \" + shard);\n}\n\n ",
