    "description": "A customer wants to contribute back this component.\n\nIt is a QParser which behaves exactly like \"lucene\" parser (extends it), but returns the Max score from the clauses, i.e. max(c1,c2,c3..) instead of the default which is sum(c1,c2,c3...). It does this by wrapping all SHOULD clauses in a DisjunctionMaxQuery with tie=1.0. Any MUST or PROHIBITED clauses are passed through as-is. Non-boolean queries, e.g. NumericRange falls-through to \"lucene\" parser.\n\nTo use, add to solrconfig.xml:\n\n  <queryParser name=\"maxscore\" class=\"solr.MaxScoreQParserPlugin\"/>\n\n\nThen use it in a query\n\nq=A AND B AND {!maxscore v=$max}&max=C OR (D AND E)\n\n\nThis will return the score of A+B+max(C,sum(D+E))",
