    "description": "The SPLITSHARD is a rather blunt tool. It looks fine when you have very few no:of shards. If we have a very large no:of shards and we need to scale out by increasing the shard count by a smaller percentage (say 20% increase) it becomes rather useless.To achieve this we need to split the existing shards more smartly in such a way that the resulting shard set will have roughly similar no:of docs.",
