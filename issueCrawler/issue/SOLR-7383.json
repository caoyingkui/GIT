Even the existing rss example is has an empty core.properties . Maybe I am missing something here?\n\nI personally don't like the concept of these catch all fields. I understand that this is helpful as \"/select\" can then use \"df=text\" \nThe alternate solution is : remove all the copy all fields and in the \"/select\" handler use edismax and define \"qf\" with the list of fields. I t personally would like this better but if you like the current solution then lets stick with that.\n\n\nI would change these three fieldTypes \n\n\n    <fieldType name=\"int\" class=\"solr.TrieIntField\" precisionStep=\"0\" positionIncrementGap=\"0\"/>\n    <fieldType name=\"tdate\" class=\"solr.TrieDateField\" precisionStep=\"6\" positionIncrementGap=\"0\"/>\n    <fieldType name=\"string\" class=\"solr.StrField\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" />\n\n\n\n\n\tIn the string fieldType we should add docValues\n\tFor the int and tdate we can change them to using points\n\tMaybe remove \"*_tdt\" or change it to points?\n\n\n\n\n    <fieldType name=\"pint\" class=\"solr.IntPointField\" docValues=\"true\"/>\n    <fieldType name=\"pdate\" class=\"solr.DatePointField\" docValues=\"true\"/>\n    <fieldType name=\"string\" class=\"solr.StrField\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" docValues=\"true\"/>\n\n\n\nLast thing I can think of is simplifying text_en_splitting\n\n\tCan we remove KeywordMarkerFilterFactory and thereby the protwords.txt\n\tAlso I'd imagine that porter stemmer in technical post summary search would be bad?\n\tI haven't actually used the example so this might not apply .

Even the existing rss example is has an empty core.properties . Maybe I am missing something here?\n\nWhat would you expect in that file? The core name is by default the same as directory name. File is present, so Solr autodiscovers the core on startup, but there is no need for any extra configuration.\n\nI personally don't like the concept of these catch all fields. I understand that this is helpful as \"/select\" can then use \"df=text\" \n\nIf we switch to eDisMax to search the original fields, then the string fields such as author will not be easily searchable and/or will require a secondary copy into a text field to be searched properly. As it is, one could facet on string field and search on catch-all text field. \n\nI would change these three fieldTypes\n\nI will look into that. I don't know much about points for now, so this is definitely a good suggestion to check.\n\nsimplifying text_en_splitting\n\nI did not want to create another type unless needed (that was my big problem with Tika example), so instead I have kept the protwords.txt and put 'lucene' in there. However, if other type is better I have no objections. \n\nDo we need to strip out html ? When I see a sample summary on http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/solr I see html chars in there.\n\nThe HTML is stripped by using two DIH transformers, so the text ends up without any HTML. There is also a new-style URP in solrconfig.xml to trim the post-DIH whitespace and - importantly in my opinion - to show that it is possible to have URPs with DIH.

Let's stick to the current approach only then. The edismax idea will bring more complexity than good here.\n\nCan we also update the README under example-DIH ?
