So at the time of 3.0, we had to support previous Lucene versions, too (which had no sysreq docs). So the general info is on the web page.\n\nAs we already removed the 2.x releases from the website, we no longer need the sysreqs global page and just refer to the per-version docs.\n\nFor Lucene 4.0 ewe have to add a markdown version to the release bundle.
