    "description": "If you do a negative only query, such as -author:[* TO *], explain returns NaN for the score. The query executes correctly, however.\n\nTo execute negative only queries, Solr calls QueryUtils.makeQueryable, and everything works correctly. But explain doesn't call this, and coord ends up dividing by zero.\n\nOne could fix this by fixing the call to explain, which is easy, or perhaps by fixing the query parser to generate the query that way in the first place. (It looks like extended dismax does the latter, and so shouldn't have problems).",

            "content": "@yonik Would it make sense for SolrQueryParser to just call makeQueryable?\n\nI don't think so... it's useful to be able to parse negative queries, either for fragments to add into a larger query (think bq in dismax, etc).  Also, the filter query code sees negative queries and looks them up (and caches them) as their positive counterpart (so fq=foo and fq=-foo will only take up a single cache entry).\n\nI think your patch is fine.
