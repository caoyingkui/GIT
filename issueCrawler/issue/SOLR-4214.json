            "content": "The primary new feature is hierarchical faceting, e.g. facet by vendor and then facet each vendor by year. I've also added stats.sort, stats.limit, and stats.offset field params. stats.sort syntax is <sum|min|max|stdDev|average|sumOfSquares|count|missing|value>:<asc|desc> and limit and offset work as in SQL. Faceting will generally use more RAM and be faster than the 4.0 baseline. I've changed more than some might consider to be strictly necessary; this is because a large part of my effort has been to make faceting performant under adverse conditions, with large result sets and faceting on fields with large (1m+) cardinalities.\n\nOne caveat: distributed stats are broken in this patch due to other work in progress. Tests pass, although I changed a few test cases relating to what happens when stats.field is completely absent in the result set. The existing behavior is to return null as the stats result and my code returns zeroed-out stats, which IMO is more felicitous anyway.\n\nThe attached patch is diffed from branches/lucene_solr_4_0. "
