    "description": "I've looked all over for specific field name requirements and can't find any official documentation. Is there official documentation on field names? If not, please provide some! \n\nWe created several field names that begin with numbers, but SOLR doesn't seem to handle that well. Here are two \"identical\" URL queries that produce different output:\n\n\nhttp://<our_server>:8080/solr/query?q=chr:19%20AND%20pos:16666101&fl=chr,pos,ref,alt,1000G_freq,AFR_freq,ASN_freq\n\nand \n\n\nhttp://<our_server>:8080/solr/query?q=chr:19%20AND%20pos:16666101&fl=chr,pos,ref,alt,AFR_freq,ASN_freq,1000G_freq\n\nThe only difference between the two queries is the location of '1000G_freq' (middle vs. end). The first query does not return the 1000G_freq value but the second does. Additionally, both return a value that does not exist (\"1000\":1000). Seems to be doing something funky with the 1000 in the field name. The \"1000\":1000 disappears if I remove '1000G_freq' from the query.\n\nHere are the outputs from both queries:\n\nQuery 1 Results\nQuery 1 Results\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":1,\n    \"params\":{\n      \"fl\":\"chr,pos,ref,alt,1000G_freq,AFR_freq,ASN_freq\",\n      \"q\":\"chr:19 AND pos:16666101\"}},\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":5,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"AFR_freq\":0.05,\n        \"ASN_freq\":0.55,\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"AFR_freq\":0.05,\n        \"ASN_freq\":0.55,\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000\":1000}]\n  }}\n\n\n\nQuery 2 Results\nQuery 2 Results\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":0,\n    \"params\":{\n      \"fl\":\"chr,pos,ref,alt,AFR_freq,ASN_freq,1000G_freq\",\n      \"q\":\"chr:19 AND pos:16666101\"}},\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":5,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000G_freq\":0.43,\n        \"AFR_freq\":0.05,\n        \"ASN_freq\":0.55,\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000G_freq\":0.43,\n        \"AFR_freq\":0.05,\n        \"ASN_freq\":0.55,\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000\":1000},\n      {\n        \"chr\":\"19\",\n        \"pos\":16666101,\n        \"ref\":\"G\",\n        \"alt\":\"C\",\n        \"1000\":1000}]\n  }}",
