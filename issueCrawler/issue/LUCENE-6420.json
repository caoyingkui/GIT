    "description": "Update forbidden-apis plugin to 1.8:\n\n\n\tInitial support for Java 9 including JIGSAW\n\tErrors are now reported sorted by line numbers and correctly grouped (synthetic methods/lambdas)\n\tPackage-level forbids: Deny all classes from a package: org.hatedpkg.** (also other globs work)\n\tIn addition to file-level excludes, forbiddenapis now supports fine granular excludes using Java annotations. You can use the one shipped, but define your own, e.g. inside Lucene and pass its name to forbidden (e.g. using a glob: **.SuppressForbidden would any annotation in any package to suppress errors). Annotation need to be on class level, no runtime annotation required.\n\n\n\nThis will for now only update the dependency and remove the additional forbid by Shalin Shekhar Mangar for MessageFormat (which is now shipped with forbidden). But we should review and for example suppress forbidden failures in command line tools using @SuppressForbidden (or similar annotation). The discussion is open, I can make a patch.",

But the solution is much easier here: It just inherits the shared execution, but changes the goal to \"check\" instead of \"testCheck\". The config is inherited, so it executes the test configuration on the src/main folder (like in Ant)\n\tsolr/core/src/test/pom.xml is special, because it still excludes the imported-commons-csv tests. I simplified this by also inheriting the config, just adding the exclude. This is similar to what Ant does.\n\n\n\nlucene/benchmark/pom.xml.template and lucene/demo/pom.xml.template should probably have lucene.txt added to their <signaturesFiles>.\n\n\n\tI solved this in a similar way by inheriting the parent configuration and just \"overriding\" the bundledSignatures config (without jdk-system-out).\n\n\n\nAlso, if I understand how things are setup, the new annotation suppresses all forms of forbiddenapi checking, as compared to the previous configuration, where there were multiple executions, and exceptions were targetted at a particular check (e.g. sysout), but didn't prevent other checks from running. In the maven build this represents a loss of coverage everywhere the annoatations are used, doesn't it? Not sure about the Ant build.\n\nYes and No  You are right, we miss some coverage (also in Ant build), but we get more coverage on the other side, because we can exclude in a more fine-granular way (on method level). I thought about this already, one solution might be (but lets keep this for later): For the very common sysout-stuff, we can add a separate @SuppressForbiddenSysout so we can scan in 2 executions. We should discuss this in a separate issue. I did not want to add too many annotations yet.\n\nOn the other hand, because we can now work more fine-granular, I would suggest to refactor the code a bit and move the \"violations\" to separate methods (like I did in the DocSetPerf tester) and only exclude those, so we don't have to exclude the whole method. For the command line tools, we might add a private method to the class containing the main method called \"printout(String)\" that is suppressed. "
