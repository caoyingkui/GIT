    "description": "I had a problem with the German stemmer, since it tries to detect nouns by\nlooking for an uppercase first letter.\nThis information is only used when a word ends with \"t\" in which case it is\nnot stemmed.\n\nHowever, it's very naive to think words are nouns if and only if they begin\nwith a capital letter. They may also be at the beginning with a sentence or\nwithin a quote, in which cases they may be set uppercase.\n\nMuch worse, however, is the fact that most people write their queries in\nlower case. That means words can be stemmed differently in the query than in\nthe index, leading to different results if someone entered the query in\nupper- or lowercase.\nExample: The word \"Fakult\u00e4ten\" is stemmed to \"fakultat\", while \"fakult\u00e4ten\"\nbecomes \"fakulta\".\n\nI commented the lines out in GermanStemmer (see below, the diff is from CVS\nversion 2002-09-05).\nHowever, I'm not enough a linguist to tell whether it is too much to stem a\ntrailing \"t\" from a noun.\n\nRegards\n\n--Clemens\n\n\n\u2014 GermanStemmer.java~1~       2002-08-19 07:13:42.000000000 +0000\n+++ GermanStemmer.java  2002-09-11 15:59:53.000000000 +0000\n@@ -72,7 +72,7 @@\n     /**\n\n\tIndicates if a term is handled as a noun.\n      */\n\n\n\tprivate boolean uppercase = false;\n+//    private boolean uppercase = false;\n\n\n\n     /**\n\n\tAmount of characters that are removed with <tt>substitute()</tt> while\nstemming.\n@@ -88,7 +88,9 @@\n     protected String stem( String term )\n     {\n        // Mark a possible noun.\n-       uppercase = Character.isUpperCase( term.charAt( 0 ) );\n+       /* uppercase = Character.isUpperCase( term.charAt( 0 ) );\n+       Can't use this - People don't use uppercase words in queries.  --Clemens\n+    */\n        // Use lowercase for medium stemming.\n        term = term.toLowerCase();\n        if ( !isStemmable( term ) )\n@@ -153,7 +155,7 @@\n                buffer.deleteCharAt( buffer.length() - 1 );\n            }\n            // \"t\" occurs only as suffix of verbs.\n\n\n\telse if ( buffer.charAt( buffer.length() - 1 ) == 't' && !\nuppercase ) {\n+           else if ( buffer.charAt( buffer.length() - 1 ) == 't' /*&& !\nuppercase*/ ) \n{\n                buffer.deleteCharAt( buffer.length() - 1 );\n            }\n            else {",
