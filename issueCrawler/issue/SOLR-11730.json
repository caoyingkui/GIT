    "description": "Let's consider a \"flaky node\" scenario.\n\nA node is going up and down at short intervals (eg. due to a flaky network cable). If the frequency of these events coincides with waitFor interval in nodeLost trigger configuration, the node may never be reported to the autoscaling framework as lost. Similarly it may never be reported as added back if it's lost again within the waitFor period of nodeAdded trigger.\n\nOther scenarios are possible here too, depending on timing:\n\n\tnode being constantly reported as lost\n\tnode being constantly reported as added\n\n\n\nOne possible solution for the autoscaling triggers is that the framework should keep a short-term (waitFor * 2 long?) memory of a node state that the trigger is tracking in order to eliminate flaky nodes (ie. those that transitioned between states more than once within the period).\n\nSituation like this is detrimental to SolrCloud behavior regardless of autoscaling actions, so it should probably be addressed at a node level by eg. shutting down Solr node after the number of disconnects in a time window reaches a certain threshold.",

            "content": "Simulations indicate that even with significant flakiness (with outages lasting up to waitFor + cooldown) the framework may not take any actions if there are other events happening too, because even if a nodeLost trigger creates an event then that event may still be discarded due to the cooldown period. And after the cooldown period has passed the flaky node may be back up again, so the event would not be generated again. ",
