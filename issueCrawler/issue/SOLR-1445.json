    "description": "I'm running into an odd issue with multi-word synonyms. Things generally seem to work as expected, but I sometimes see words that are the leading term in a multi-word synonym being replaced with the token that follows them in the stream when they should just be ignored (i.e. there's no synonym match for just that token). When I preview the analysis at admin/analysis.jsp it looks fine, but at runtime I see problems like the one in the attached unit test.",
