    "description": "Maven test fails on the following package:\nsolr/contrib/map-reduce/\n(seen on solr6 trunk and solr 5.x branch)\n\nThe underlying problem seems to be that when running maven test, the java security manager is not set. When running ant test, the security manager is set to org.apache.lucene.util.TestSecurityManager. \n\nThe failing test is skipped while running ant test due to an assumption in org/apache/solr/hadoop/MorphlineBasicMiniMRTest.java:\n\nassumeTrue(\n        \"Currently this test can only be run without the lucene test security policy in place\",\n        System.getProperty(\"java.security.manager\", \"\").equals(\"\"));\n\nIn maven, the test is not skipped and fails.\n\nI propose aligning the ant and maven test so they use the same security manager.",
