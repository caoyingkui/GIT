    "description": "It appears to me that the spell-check component can't build a dictionary based on phonetic similarity (i.e. using a Phonetic analysis filter). Sure, you can go ahead and configure the spell check component to use a field type that uses a phonetic filter but the suggestions presented to the user are based on the indexed values (i.e. phonemes), not the original words.  Thus the user will be presented with a suggested phoneme which is a poor user experience.  It's not clear how this shortcoming could be rectified because for a given phoneme, there are potentially multiple words to choose from that could be encoded to a given phoneme.  Ideally the more popular occurrence would be chosen but I'm not sure how this would be implemented.",

If someone wanted this then it would probably not be too difficult given the common infrastructure that spellcheck & suggesters share. "
