    "description": "Today the facet module indexes a term for each facet added to a\ndocument, and DrillDown/SidewaysQuery assume this by creating a\nTermQuery, or OR of TermQuery, for each dimension the app drills down\non.\n\nI think we should relax this and allow an [expert] arbitrary query to\ndrill down on a given dimension ... e.g., this can enable future\ndynamic faceting methods, or custom app drill-down methods.\n\nIt's easy for DrillDownQuery to do this, but requires generalization\nin DrillSideways, basically just reviving the first approach on\nLUCENE-4748.  This approach is somewhat slower, but more general\n... it will keep using the current method as an optimization when it\napplies.\n\nThis should also fix the possible performance regression from\nLUCENE-4952 when scoreSubDocsAtOnce is true, by using the\nMinShouldMatchSumScorer in that case.",
