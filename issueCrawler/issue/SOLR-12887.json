What happens if a timestamp change logically 'moves' the document out of its original collection?",

            "content": "Attached draft illustrative patch. Intuitively:\n\n\tan add/update to redate the document within its existing collection should be just fine, but\n\tan add/update that changes the timestamp to a value outside the existing collection would result in two documents in two collections.\n\tIf two documents are not what is intended by the client then they can do a delete followed by an add instead of just an add/update alone.\n\n\n\nInterestingly the draft patch in its current form suggests that query behaviour is variable when two TRA collections have a document with the same key i.e. sometimes it says \"found 1\" and sometimes it says \"found 2\" even if \"cache=false\" was sent in the query. Could be to do with which url the test's CloudSolrClient used for the requests, haven't yet looked into further. ",
