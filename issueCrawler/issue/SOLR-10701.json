However, I don't see an easy way to pass it with Solr syntax (q={!child..}...&sort=parentfield(name) asc).\n\nStephen Weiss, does it seems useful as-is? \n\nThe patch also introduces BlockJoinParentQParser.AllParentsQuerySupplier which is implemented by BlockJoinParentQParser.AllParentsAware BlockJoinChildQParser.AllParentsAwareToChildQuery. I wonder whether it's good enough to come in.  ",
