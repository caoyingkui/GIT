I will attach a screenshot.\n\nIt wasn't possible to see or highlight the full string.  I did manage to see it all when I maximized my browser window (on a 1680x1050 screen), but I really dislike running with windows maximized.  It's not like I keep the windows small either \u2013 the screenshot will reflect this.",

The other is to use a different HTML element to display informational elements \u2013 perhaps a textbox where the text can be selected and scrolled horizontally by the selection (without a scrollbar).  I've seen something like that, but have absolutely no idea what it's called in the HTML/CSS world. ",

If we can support android/IOS mobile devices, that's even better.  Tablets would be more important than phones, but if we do it right, a phone could work.  I know that the old UI is extremely painful on my android phone, but I have not tried the Angular UI yet.\n\nNow that I've thought about the Angular UI, I did just double-check the impl strings there on my desktop, and it has the same problem.

Although you can make a desktop browser show the full string by maximizing it on a monitor with enough pixels available, rotating the phone horizontal and zooming in/out make no difference.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Angular UI actually works on my phone browser.  I can open a separate issue to discuss the few nits that I've noticed. ",

The scrollbar appears when hovered or touched on the individual value area.\n\n    Tested on several browsers on Mac, Windows and Android. On Windows, the scrollbar makes the page jump a little bit for the args section, but is quite usable. On Mac and Android, the scrollbar is inside the area and does not cause a jump.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/arafalov/lucene-solr-contributions master\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/54.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #54\n\n\ncommit 3c4b5db04935499972c281cc28cce8fb3e529a4a\nAuthor: Alexandre Rafalovitch <arafalov@gmail.com>\nDate:   2016-07-26T14:33:09Z\n\n    Angular Admin UI: Fix cut-off overflow strings on dashboard page (FIX\n    SOLR-8911)\n\n ",
