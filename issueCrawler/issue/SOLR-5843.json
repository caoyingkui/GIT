You'll get the initialization failures.\n\nNow - this part is a bit vague - I don't remember the exact cleanup operations I did - but I think if you go and delete the invalid collection it may or may not make the errors go away. I thought that in previous cases when I issued the calls to delete the improperly created collections that it cleaned the errors up, but it doesn't appear to have in this case. It's possible that one of the nodes was in a weird state at the time, not sure. \n\nMy current situation is I have two nodes, and ONE of them still has the bogus errors on it, even though all the tabs (and zk tree view) all show no references to the invalid cores.\n\n\nbeta1_urlDebug_xxxxxxxxx_v16_shard1_replica2: org.apache.solr.common.cloud.ZooKeeperException:org.apache.solr.common.cloud.ZooKeeperException: Could not find configName for collection beta1_urlDebug_xxxxxxxxx_v16_shard1_replica2 found:[c-v17, default]\n\nIt's almost like it lost track of the fact that the collection was deleted for the purpose of the error reporting.\n\nI also can't find ANY reference to that error in the logs currently on the box, so appears to be in-memory only.

Not sure what state it was in. If y'all think this is a goofy edge case that isn't likely to re-occur, go ahead and close this. Either way though, I do think there should be a way to tell solr \"clear your errors and retry/refresh\".  "
