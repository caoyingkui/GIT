            "content": "i don't know much about french, but a few comments...\n\n1) \"stopwords\" seems like an odd name for what i would think of as a \"prefix\" .. you may want an example in the javadocs to make it clear.\n\n2) are Elison's always lowercase?  I imagine there should be an ignoreCase option just like StopFilter has.  (note that toLowerCase() is hardcoded in the next() method, but nothing ensures that the stopwords list is lowercased)\n\n3) are there any other characters that can appear between an elision and it's root word besides '\\'' ? (i'm particularly wondering about other unicode characters that look like byte 0x27 but are not actually 0x27)\n\n4) this probably doesn't need to be in it's own contrib.  contrib/analyzers should be fine .... if Elison's are specific to french, then contrib/analyzers/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/fr/ makes the most sense, otherwise it might make sense to add a new subpackage under analysis ... \"linguistics\" perhaps (in contrast to the existing \"ngram\") ?
