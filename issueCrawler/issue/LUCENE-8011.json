Maybe we could go even further and do the following:\n\n\tin the Axiomatic similarity, add abstract methods to allow sub classes to explain how tf, ln, etc. are computed,\n\tmake BasicModel.explain abstract to force sub classes to have their own explanation and include the formula,\n\tmake sure that our own sub classes of SimilarityBase extend explain (the one that returns an explanation) and include the formula in the explanation.\n\n\n\n    For the record, there is not too much concern to have about backward compatibility since most of those classes (eg. Axiomatic, BasicModel) are very expert classes and this changes targets master. ",

I tried running tests on your PR, but I'm getting failures. It seems to be due to the fact that some of the explanations that you added look like `computed as x from: ` while the test framework expects `computed as x from:` (no trailing whitespace). Removing these trailing whitespaces in explanations should fix the issue. ",
