    "description": "A few of us were discussing at Buzzwords on how a common use case requirement is \"match documents which have values for a field\"\n\nTo do this we need to query \"-fq:brand:*\" . This query can be slow and can be optimized\n\nWe can take advantage of NormsFieldExistsQuery and DocValuesFieldExistsQuery to speed up this use-case and not have to resort to\u00a0WildcardQuery\u00a0\n\nToday Solr's schema has doc-values enabled for fields that support it and for text fields norms are enabled by default so most users would already have the necessary indexed structures",
