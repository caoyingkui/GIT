    "description": "Solr has to ship with the software licenses. However, they are there just for reference and take valuable decompressed disk space and decompression time. They could instead be shipped as an inner archive, so those who want to check them still can by unarchiving them.\n\nThe main question is: whether the inner archive format should match the outer archive format for different platforms? Or whether it should use the neutral archive format such as .jar? Or just stick to .zip?",
