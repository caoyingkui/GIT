    "description": "Right now if DIH is invoked in SolrCloud it feeds docs one by one synchronously via DistributedUpdateProcessor.  \nIt's proposed to create DIHWriter implementation which will stream docs with SolrCloudClient. I expect per-shard parallelism and even more with CloudSolrClient.setParallelUpdates(true).\nWhat's your feeling about it?",
