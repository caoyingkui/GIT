About the corner cases:\n\nIf we are going to add new tests anyway, maybe we could fashion it as a base class like BaseDocValuesFormat/BasePostingsFormat?\nEach TVFormat we have (4.0, simpletext, 4.2, etc) would extend this base class and just return getCodec().\n\nAny tests in TestTermVectors/Reader/Writer today that are testing codecs (and not really indexwriter tests) could be folded in.\n\nOf course if any tests are *compressing specific they can just stay in its folder too.
