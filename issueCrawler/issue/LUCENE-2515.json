To keep control over the amounts of search threads created, please allow a ExecutorService to be supplied to the ParallelMultiSearcher so they can share resources. \n\nAlso, please make it optional to have the shutdown or shutdownNow method of the executor called in (for example) the finalize method of ParallelMultiSearcher.",
