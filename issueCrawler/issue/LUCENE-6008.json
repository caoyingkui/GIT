ASF Jenkins is overloaded and monster tests should not run there, as this would hold other long-running stuff like nightly.\n\nIf somebody wants to spend another Jenkins server, I would be happy to put it into the policeman cloud, so it will make use of JVM randomization. In fact this additional server should maybe run only monster tests and only on linux with all known jvm configs? ",
