    "description": "The Search custom tag is an iteration tag that loops over the results of\n\tcriteria passed to the Lucene search engine.\n\tThis tag supports parameters for passing the search criteria to the \nsearch engine\n\tand then returns information about the result set to the page \nprogrammer through the\n\tname used in this tags ID attribute.\n\tAny field stored in the search index will be accessible after the \nstart tag has run\n\tby calling the result set's someID.getField(String name) method which \nwill locate the\n\tvalue of the field and return it as a string. In the event that no \nsuch field exists\n\tit will return an empty string.\n\tIf you need to get a list of the field names ahead of time you can \ncall the tags's getFields()\n\tmethod and it will return you a Set of field names that can be \niterated over as you will\n\tsee in the result.jsp example provided with this documentation.\n\tThe object passed back through the tag's ID attribute is the current \ninstance of the tag \n\titself, so all of the public information for this instance is \navailable and you will see\n\tmore reference to this in the tag reference section.",
