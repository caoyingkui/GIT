    "description": "While adding the new common module, I ran into a name collision with Lucene's common-build.xml project name.  I've since renamed the common module's project name to be clearer, but I think we should rename common-build's one as well.  Solr's common-build.xml uses common-solr, so lets rename Lucene's to common-lucene.",
