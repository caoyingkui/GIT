    "description": "Currently a ShardHandler is created for a request even for non distributed requests.  The checkDistributed function on ShardHandler has no special state kept in the ShardHandler.  Historically it used to be in QueryComponent, but it seems like SearchHandler would be the right place.",

            "content": "I can see the motivation there, but in this case it means a ShardHandler must be created per request to determine if it is distributed or not.  IMO, it is very nice if you want to have one request handler for distributed requests to set it up there. "
