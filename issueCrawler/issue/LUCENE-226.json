            "content": "Since when does \"\" == null?\n\nQueryParser itself cannot deal with open ended range queries - you have to provide a concrete \nbeginning and ending term.  Using \"\" as the begin works because nothing is less than that.  But using \"\" \nas the end term is like saying a range like this [m TO a] - it just doesn't make sense since the ending \nterm is less than the beginning term and nothing will be in that range.\n\nRangeQuery API, however, does allow you to put null (again, NOT \"\") for a begin or end value leaving an \nend open.\n\nI'm closing this issue as INVALID.
