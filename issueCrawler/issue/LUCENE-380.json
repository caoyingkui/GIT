    "description": "I would like to contribute a greek analyzer for lucene. It is based on the\nexisting Russian analyzer and features:\n\n\n\tmost common greek character sets, such as Unicode, ISO-8859-7 and Windows-1253\n\ta collection of common greek stop words\n\tconversion of characters with diacritics (accent, diaeresis) in the lower case\nfilter, as well as handling of special characters, such as small final sigma\n\n\n\nFor the character sets I used RFC 1947 (Greek Character Encoding for Electronic\nMail Messages) as a reference. I have incorporated this analyzer in Luke as well\nas used it successfully in a recent project of my company (EBS Ltd.).\n\nI hope you will find it a useful addition to the project.",
