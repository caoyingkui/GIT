    "description": "We had a requirement to elevate result documents based on individual signal values and after searching thoroughly into available Solr modules, we couldn't find anything and therefore decided to write our own module.\n\nProblem Description: We wanted to boost results in a probabilistic fashion. i.e x% of the results on each page must have a signal value above threshold value. One immediate usecase that can be thought of is recent results. We want to boost results which are above a certain threshold such that x% of the results in each page belong to these recent documents.\n\nSolution: We extend the solrQueryElevationComponent to support our probabilistic elevation component. An additional comparator is added and the overall runTime changes from nlogn to 2nlogn",
