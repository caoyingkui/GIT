    "description": "The addition of holes to GeoConvex and GeoConcave polygon shapes has broken two things:\n(1) The edge points returned should include the hole edge points;\n(2) The outer distance computation should include distance from hole edges.\n\nThis ticket is complicated by the fact that holes as provided by GeoPolygonFactory can be entirely outside of the polygon; no checking or pruning is done.  It is unknown whether having edge points from outside holes will lead to improper return values for getRelationship() results.",
