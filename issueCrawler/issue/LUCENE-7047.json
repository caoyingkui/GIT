See any of the other Points as an example. There is likely a lot of exposed surface (additional methods/members) from Field itself and it risks being hidden/disorganized otherwise.\n\ttest toString() of the returned shape query if not already tested.\n\n "

            "content": "Thanks for the pointers Robert Muir.\n\nI fixed toString for Geo3DPointField and its shape query, and added tests, but found a bug a FieldType.toString where we failed to \"disclose\" that we are indexing points.  I fixed that and this provoked new test failures, and then I tried to improve the existing toStrings, and fixed further test failures.  I also switched to native types for encode/decodeDimension on the core point fields.\n\nI think this is ready but I still need to run all tests ... "
