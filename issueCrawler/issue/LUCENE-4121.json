            "content": "First version of the patch.\n\nI first tried to replace the size methods by either memSize or diskSize depending on what they measured. But I was not happy with the fact that some diskSize methods might actually measure in-memory sizes when the underlying directory implementation is a RAMDirectory. So I ended up with 3 method names:\n\n\tmemSize, for in-memory usage,\n\tdiskSize, for on-disk size (hybrid data structures may implement both methods),\n\tbyteSize for abstract types (SegmentInfo, MergePolicy, ...). In that case, the byteSize may actually be a memSize or a diskSize depending on the directory implementation.\n\n\n\nOr maybe we could still use diskSize, RAMDirectory being a special case. diskSize would even make sense for CachingRAMDirectory actually.
