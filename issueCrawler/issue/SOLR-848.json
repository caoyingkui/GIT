    "description": "If you look at this wiki page :\n\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/SimpleFacetParameters\n\nYou will notice the url may looks like :\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=video&rows=0&facet=true&facet.field=inStock&facet.query=price:[*+TO+500]&facet.query=price:[500+TO+*]\n\nTwo values for the field facet.query. It can also happen you have several values for the variable facet.field.\n\nUnfortunately, here is the current Apache_Solr_Service::search method\n\npublic function search($query, $offset = 0, $limit = 10, $params = array())\n\t{\n(...)\n$queryString = http_build_query($params, null, $this->_queryStringDelimiter);\n(...)\n}\n\n$params is an associative array. In my opinion, (tell me if i am wrong), but this way you cannot generate this kind of query.\n\nRegards\n\nAntoine Tissier",

            "content": "Antoine,\n\nYes, the params argument is an associative array - I felt this was the simplest way to support all the possible arguments that different output writers and searchers can take.  This doesn't exclude you from passing multiple values for the same parameter, as in your case.  I use http_build_query() but then reformat the query string into what Solr expects.  Just pass all \"repeat\" parameters as arrays of value, Solr will parse each set of related values in order (ie. facet.field and facet.query).\n\n\n\tDonovan\n\n "
