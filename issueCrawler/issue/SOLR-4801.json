            "content": "The profanity is in the log because it's in the example solrconfig.xml file, and this config was likely based on the example.  We might want to replace that path in the example config with something less controversial.  I find it amusing, and I hate giving into such pressures, but we have to live in the real world.\n\nI'm wondering if these warnings might be another symptom of SOLR-4791.\n\nLeith Tussing, does everything work despite the warnings?  If you used the entire Solr download as-is, those paths should exist, but if you've copied only required bits from example into a separate Jetty installation, they would not exist.  Do you need any of the contrib features in one of the directories that are mentioned?  Is testing a branch_4x checkout something you can do?  A more relevant option would be to try 4.3.0 source with the patch from SOLR-4791. "

I had copied over just the dist\\solr-4.3.0.war and renamed it to solr.war at first which then resulted in failed loading.  Looking at the logs informed me I was missing slf4j components so I then read the newly created http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrLogging which informed me to copy over the solr/example/lib/ext items as well.\n\nFrom everything I've testing the functionality is working as expected.  I was able to add new entries and search existing ones.  As far as I know we do not need the contrib items, however if I've incorrectly installed Solr I'd like to know how to fix it.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how to run the branch_4x (this correct? http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/branches/branch_4x/solr/) or the normal 4.3.0 as source.  If there is some guidance documentation you can point me to I would gladly give it a try. "

            "content": "As far as I know we do not need the contrib items, however if I've incorrectly installed Solr I'd like to know how to fix it.\n\nIn my mind, your minimalist install approach is the right way to go.  I also take a minimalist approach to forking the example solrconfig.xml.  When forking the example schema.xml, my approach is semi-minimalist - the \"primitive\" fieldType entries are very useful to keep around.\n\nIf one of these lib directories does not exist, solr should fail hard. This total/crap/ignored is an anti-feature.\n\nAs much as the little bit of profanity amuses me, I agree with Robert.  Config elements that reference invalid information or have typos should result in a launch failure.  For solrconfig.xml, that would result in that core not loading.  The same goes for errors in a <core> tag in solr.xml.  For parts of solr.xml outside of the <core> tags, it should result in Solr failing to start.  Unrelated note:  This is another indirect argument in favor of Solr no longer being a webapp.\n\nJan H\u00f8ydahl, I hope that your proposed config example was just a quick brain dump and you don't really want \"str\" tags in solr.xml.  That would probably make it very hard to catch config errors at startup time.\n\nOn a larger XML topic, using generic tags (str, int, etc) might make sense in parts of solrconfig.xml where it is used extensively, but I have sometimes wondered whether there would be fewer problems if we used more specific tags and fewer generic.  Making it through the transition period might be a nightmare, though. "
