    "description": "Hi,\n\nwe are currently facing the issue that some calculated values of the TV component are obviously wrong with enabled\nExactStatsCache. --> shard-wide TV docfreq calculation\n\nThis problem is subsequent to\nSOLR-8459 NPE using TermVectorComponent in combinition with ExactStatsCache\n\n\nMaybe the problem is very trivial and we configured something wrong ...\n\nSo lets go deeper into that problem:\n\n\n1) The problem in summary:\n==================\nWe are requesting with enabled \"tv.df\", \"tv.tf\" and \"tv.tf_idf\" --> \n\ntv.df=true&tv.tf_idf=true&tv.tf=true\n\n\nadditionally for debugging purposes we are requesting by calling \n\ntermfreq(\"site_term_maincontent\",\"abakus\"),docfreq(\"site_maincontent_term_wdf\",\"abakus\"),ttf(\"site_maincontent_term_wdf\",\"abakus\")\n\n\n\nOur findings are:\n\n\tthe tv.tf as well as the termfreq seems to be correct\n\tthe tv.df as well as the docfreq is obviously wrong\n\tthe tv.tf_idf as well as ttf is wrong as well, I guess as subsequent fault of the tv.df (docfeq)\n\n\n\n\n2) What we have:\n===========\nschema.xml:\n\n...\n        <field name=\"site_maincontent_term_wdf\" type=\"text_token_wdf\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" termVectors=\"true\"\n               termPositions=\"true\" termOffsets=\"true\"/>\n...\n        <fieldType name=\"text_token_wdf\" class=\"solr.TextField\" positionIncrementGap=\"100\">\n            <analyzer>\n                <tokenizer class=\"solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory\"/>\n                <filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n                <charFilter class=\"solr.MappingCharFilterFactory\" mapping=\"mapping.txt\"/>\n            </analyzer>\n        </fieldType>\n...\n\n\n\nsolrconfig.xml:\n\n...\n    <statsCache class=\"org.apache.solr.search.stats.ExactStatsCache\"/>\n...\n    <searchComponent name=\"tvComponent\" class=\"org.apache.solr.handler.component.TermVectorComponent\"/>\n    <requestHandler name=\"/tvrh\" class=\"org.apache.solr.handler.component.SearchHandler\">\n        <lst name=\"defaults\">\n            <bool name=\"tv\">true</bool>\n        </lst>\n        <arr name=\"last-components\">\n            <str>tvComponent</str>\n        </arr>\n    </requestHandler>\n...\n\n\n\nYou can find out any details here:\nhttp://149.202.5.192:8820/solr/#/SingleDomainSite_34_shard1_replica1\n\n\n3) Examples\n========\n\nIf you are calling this link you can see that there are 6 existent documents containing the word \"abakus\" in the field \"site_maincontent_term_wdf\" ...\n\nhttp://149.202.5.192:8820/solr/SingleDomainSite_34_shard1_replica1/tvrh?q=site_maincontent_term_wdf%3Aabakus+AND+site_headercode%3A200&shards.qt=%2Ftvrh&tv.fl=site_maincontent_term_wdf&tv.df=true&tv.tf_idf=true&tv.tf=true&fl=site_url_id,site_url,termfreq%28%22site_term_maincontent%22,%22abakus%22%29,docfreq%28%22site_maincontent_term_wdf%22,%22abakus%22%29,ttf%28%22site_maincontent_term_wdf%22,%22abakus%22%29\n\nBut if you are looking into the field \"docfreq\" in the output documents, it is incorrect and always different (sould be always the same ...).\n\n\"docfreq(field,term) returns the number of documents that contain the term in the field. This is a constant (the same value for all documents in the index).\"\n\n\n\nHere is a link with enabled shards.info:\nhttp://149.202.5.192:8820/solr/SingleDomainSite_34_shard1_replica1/tvrh?&wt=xml&q=site_maincontent_term_wdf%3Aabakus&start=0&rows=10&fl=ttf%28site_maincontent_term_wdf%2C%27abakus%27%29%2Cdocfreq%28site_maincontent_term_wdf%2C%27abakus%27%29%2Cidf%28site_maincontent_term_wdf%2C%27abakus%27%29%2Csite_url&shards.qt=/tvrh&shards.info=true\n\n\nHere is a link with enabled debug:\nhttp://149.202.5.192:8820/solr/SingleDomainSite_34_shard1_replica1/tvrh?omitHeader=true&shards.qt=%2Ftvrh&wt=xml&json.nl=flat&q=site_maincontent_term_wdf%3Aabakus&start=0&rows=1000&fl=ttf%28site_maincontent_term_wdf%2C%27abakus%27%29%2Cdocfreq%28site_maincontent_term_wdf%2C%27abakus%27%29%2Cidf%28site_maincontent_term_wdf%2C%27abakus%27%29%2Csite_url&debugQuery=true",

Not arbitrary terms in case of TermVectorComponent. \n\nIt will be very costly if we do that, so should we support this kind of operation for ExactStatsCache + TermVectorComponent?\n\nVarun Thacker Yonik Seeley : What about yours opinion?
