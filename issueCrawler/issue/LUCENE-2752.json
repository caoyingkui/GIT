    "description": "While trying to use lucene SpanQuery (e.g. SpanTermQuery) in a solr QueryComponent.process(), I got a NPE on the EmptySpanTerms.toString() method. \n\nI assume this should be overridden, with something, but not sure what. I just override and return \"empty spans\", but would assume something better should go there (empty string, null,...).\n\nInterestingly, the error did not bubble up, so I spent a while thinking I had bad queries or test content. Queries just came back blank. After digging a bit, I noticed the 'embedded' error, and tracked down the source. With an overridden EST.toString() my span queries worked again. I have no idea what else depends on EST, or if overriding the toString() will cascade problems. 'ant test' in the lucene branch seemed to pass all tests (Build Successful).",
