It should contain help on how to invoke it.\n\nFurthermore, if would be nice if it inferred the svn release version and the distribution version by assuming a conventional URL format.  For example: \"http://people.apache.org/~rmuir/staging_area/lucene_solr_4_9_0_r1604085/\"\nis 1604085 and 4.9.0.   Or, at least remind you that the URL may contain this info.",
