To do so The master must know about the slaves. The slaves may be able to register themselves with master but the slaves\ndo not know the port number and the context in which the app is deployed.\n\nThe CoreContainer (or any other suitable place) can keep this information with itself so any handler can consume this. Other than the port number everything else is\navailable at the startup time.The port number can be obtained soon after the first request is served by the slave .",
