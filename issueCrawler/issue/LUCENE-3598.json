    "description": "Followup on a thread by Shai Erea on java-dev@lao: I already discussed with Robert about that, that there is one thing missing. Currently the IW only checks if the infoStream!=null and then passes the message to the method, and that may ignore it. For your requirement it is the case that this is enabled or disabled dynamically. Unfortunately if the construction of the message is heavy, then this wastes resources.\n\nI would like to add another method to this class: abstract boolean isEnabled() that can also be implemented. I would then replace all null checks in IW by this method. The default config in IW would be changed to use a NoOutputInfoStream that returns false here and ignores the message.\n\nA simple logger wrapper for e.g. log4j / slf4j then could look like (ignoring component, could be enabled):\n\n\nLoger log = YourLoggingFramework.getLogger(IndexWriter.class);\n\npublic void message(String component, String message) {\n  log.debug(component + \": \" + message);\n}\n\npublic boolean isEnabled(String component) {\n  return log.isDebugEnabled();\n}\n\n\n\nUsing this you could enable/disable logging live by e.g. the log4j management console of your app server by enabling/disabling IndexWriter.class logging.\n\nThe changes are really simple:\n\n\tPrintStreamInfoStream returns true, always, mabye make it dynamically enable/disable to allow Shai's request\n\tinfoStream.getDefault() is never null and can never be set to null. Instead the default is a singleton NoOutputInfoStream that returns false of isEnabled(component).\n\tAll null checks on infoStream should be replaced by infoStream.isEanbled(component), this is possible as always != null. There are no slowdowns by this - it's like Collections.emptyList() instead stupid null checks.",

(even JCL defaults to writting to System.err instead of being a NOOP!)\n\nSo lets keep simple/common things simple/common/fast \u2013 and people who want to hook into a logging framework can do that.\n\nHell: since JUL is guaranteed to be implemented by all JVMs, and since we already have the Jar for the SLF4J API in the build system for Solr, it would be trivial to offer out of the box JUL and SLF4J backed implementations of the InfoStream API to make it really trivial for client apps to use them ",
