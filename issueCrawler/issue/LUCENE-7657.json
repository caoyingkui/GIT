So if you build a (Span)TermQuery that references a TermContext and this query gets cached, then it will keep holding a reference to the index reader, even after the latter gets closed.",

We only unset the context in createWeight, so wrapper queries like BooleanQuery or ToParentBlockJoinQuery would still have a reference to the index reader if the wrap a TermQuery that has a TermContext. So I guess the only way would be to remove the reference from TermContext to the index readers. ",
