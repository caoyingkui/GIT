    "description": "The current framework for handling term normalisation works via instanceof checks for MultiTermAwareComponent and casts.\u00a0 MultiTermAwareComponent itself deals\u00a0in AbstractAnalysisComponents, and so callers need to cast to the correct component type before use, which is ripe for misuse.\n\nWe should re-organise all this to be type-safe and usable without casts.\u00a0 One possibility is to add `normalize` methods to CharFilterFactory and TokenFilterFactory that mirror their existing `create` methods.\u00a0 The default implementation would\u00a0return the input unchanged, while filters that should apply at normalization time can delegate to `create`.\n\nRelated to this, we should deprecate and remove LowerCaseTokenizer, which combines tokenization and normalization in a way that will break this API.",

            "content": "Thanks for the pull request Mayya Sharipova!  I've extended it to cover Solr as well, which allows us to remove MultiTermAwareComponent entirely.\n\nThis causes some test failures in Solr's MultiTermTest, but seeing as these explicitly testing implementation (which has now changed), and the behaviour itself is tested elsewhere in eg TestFoldingMultitermQuery I think we should be OK to just remove this test?  Erick Erickson you wrote the tests originally, does that sound reasonable to you? ",

            "content": "For crying out loud, I wrote that 11 years ago and you expect me to remember why \n\nOK, I'll get serious now. The\u00a0origin of MultTermAware but was to allow us to apply some filters for wildcard queries, it all started with LowerCaseFilter. I got really tired of explaining to users that \"Sol*\" didn't find \"solr\" because\u00a0terms with wildcards were unanalyzed. As long as that behavior is retained that test can be removed for all of me. It's pretty out of date, it only\u00a0verifies that\u00a0a few of the filters that implement that interface anyway.\n\nSo remove it if you see fit. A more effective test of the behavior I care about would be determining if all the filters that implement that interface properly work with, say, wildcards in the search term. ",
