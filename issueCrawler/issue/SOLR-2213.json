I looked for all the places where 1.2.3 was mentioned and upgraded (including licence statements), removed 1.2.3 and added 1.4.3 to webapp/web/admin.\n\nI've done very cursory testing so far, debug.jsp comes up, I can look at the schema and the solr/browse page \"looks ok\".\n\nNo test are failing as a result of this patch.\n\nWhere should I test next?
