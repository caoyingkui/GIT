    "description": "The build system packages Lucene libraries in the Solr war, but they do not pack libraries required by the Lucene libraries. The UIMA and analysis-extras contrib packages have factories for the Lucene libraries.\n\nThe net effect is that when solrconfig.xml include <lib> directives for dist/xxx-contribX-xxx.jar and solr/contrib/contribX/lib, this fails because the lucene analyzer file inside the solr war cannot find the library files in solr/contrib/contribX/lib because the classloader for the war does not find the libraries from the <lib> directives.\n\nTwo alternative fixes are presented below.",

The solrconfig.xml then has three <lib> directives:\n\n../../dist/xxx-contribX-xxx.jar\n../../contrib/contribX/lib\n../../contrib/contribX/lucene-lib\n\nI'm doing this for the OpenNLP patch. Since this adds a lucene-lib directory in solr/contrib, it requires adding 'clean' to the ant targets in solr/contrib. Add <contrib-crawl target=\"clean\" failonerror=\"false\"/> to solr/build.xml:target clean "

            "content": "Here is the hard way: repack dependent jars into all contrib dist/ jars. For example, pack everything about analysis-extras into dist/analysis-extras.jar. Remove the contrib lucene libraries from the war file. \n\nAdd this to solr/contrib/analysis-extras/build.xml:\n\n  <target name=\"addjars\">\n    <zip destfile=\"../../dist/apache-solr-analysis-extras-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" update=\"true\">\n\t<zipfileset src=\"../../../lucene/build/analysis/common/lucene-analyzers-common-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"../../../lucene/build/analysis/icu/lucene-analyzers-icu-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"../../../lucene/build/analysis/kuromoji/lucene-analyzers-kuromoji-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"../../../lucene/build/analysis/morfologik/lucene-analyzers-morfologik-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"../../../lucene/build/analysis/phonetic/lucene-analyzers-phonetic-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"../../../lucene/build/analysis/smartcn/lucene-analyzers-smartcn-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"../../../lucene/build/analysis/stempel/lucene-analyzers-stempel-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\n\t<zipfileset src=\"lib/icu4j-49.1.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"lib/morfologik-fsa-1.5.3.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"lib/morfologik-polish-1.5.3.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n\t<zipfileset src=\"lib/morfologik-stemming-1.5.3.jar\" excludes=\"META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\" />\n    </zip>\n  </target>\n\n\n\nRun 'ant dist addjars'. The dist jar goes from 20k (one file) to 21M (4035 files). But, it is 21M in one deployable file. Everything is in one place! (If the size bothers you, split the Chinese, Japanese and Polish support into separate contribs.)\n\nCaveats:\n\n\tThis approach needs a little rearranging of the order of the build steps. There is no place visible to the contrib build.xml where the solr/build dist jar is finished, but not yet copied to dist/. I don't know what to do about META-INF files in the absorbed libraries. This approach just preserves the manifest file.\n\n\n\n\n\tRedundant dependencies:\n\t\n\t\tanalysis-extras and extraction both use icu4j, which is a huge jar. Too bad.\n\t\tdataimporter wants all of extraction. Stick with the current arrangement.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nThis design is appropriate for analysis-extras, uima and opennlp. All of these have lucene libraries and lib/ directories, and the current build arrangement just plain does not work. It is a convenience for clustering, dataimporthandler (-extras), extraction, langid, and velocity. \n\nThe build.xml file above needs macro-izing. As mentioned the build sequence needs a point where the contrib build can repack the dist file inside solr/build. "
