            "content": "Determining DIH status in a program is a far harder problem than it needs to be.  I've filed a number of issues.  I have found the DIH code to be very layered, using abstractions effectively, but hard to understand for someone who's not familiar with it.  I'm sure that once you become familiar with it, the use of abstraction actually helps, but it's a barrier when you don't know the code already.\n\nThis looks like a nearly identical issue to SOLR-2729, but in newer versions the extraneous space has been removed from the \"Time taken\" field name.  I can't tell if the original command was a delta-import, but I assume that it probably was, which would make this a duplicate of SOLR-2729. ",
