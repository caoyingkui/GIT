    "description": "This issue addresses multiple minor improvements to RecoveryStrategy:\n\n\n\tLogging improvements: proper use of Logger interface, improve log messages.\n\tConsolidated a debug block into a method and reuse.\n\tGet rid of unused and deprecated code.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the code over-slept between recovery attempts. The inline comment suggested that the intention was to sleep between 1 second to 1 minute, while implement an exponential sleep interval strategy. However in practice the code sleeps in intervals of 5 seconds and up to 5 minutes. So I fixed the code to sleep at interval of 5 seconds (checking if it was closed in between sleep attempts) and up to 1 minute.",
