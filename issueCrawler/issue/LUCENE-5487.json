    "description": "This is just an exploratory patch ... still many nocommits, but I\nthink it may be promising.\n\nI find the two booleans we pass to Weight.scorer confusing, because\nthey really only apply to whoever will call score(Collector) (just\nIndexSearcher and BooleanScorer).\n\nThe params are pointless for the vast majority of scorers, because\nvery, very few query scorers really need to change how top-scoring is\ndone, and those scorers can only score top-level (throw throw UOE\nfrom nextDoc/advance).  It seems like these two types of scorers\nshould be separately typed.",

It became hard to know the firstDocID since consumers of TopScorer can't .nextDoc.  Maybe there is another way ...\n\n(sorry the crazyness of this score(Collector, maxDoc) stuff is horrible to understand, especially, if you want to implement it correctly!)\n\nIt is ... and I think we only have this version (the one that takes 2nd param, int max) for the \"BS1 embeds BS1\" case?  Maybe we don't need to optimize this case?  (Maybe a BQ embedded a BQ should rewrite itself to a single BQ, if somehow we could account for the proper coord scoring).\n\nAnother idea I had: we can make TopScorer an interface\n\nThat's a neat idea!  So then e.g. IS.search (and BS1 embeds BS1 case) would check if the Scorer it pulled impls TopScorer, and if so, cast it and call .score(Collector); else, it would fallback to the default impl. ",

This is because BQ's Weight.scorer passes \"true\" for topScorer when it pulls the sub-scorers.\n\nBut, the patch should fix this I think, so that BS1 sub-scorer can be used.
