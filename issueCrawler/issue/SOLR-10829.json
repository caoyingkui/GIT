    "description": "if a uniqueKey field is defined, then the IndexSchema should fail fast & hard on startup if the field type of the specific uniqueKey uses \"points\" (ie: FieldType.isPointField())\n\nThe reason for this is because deleting by id, and overwriting existing documents are predicated on being able to use IndexWriter.deleteDocuments(Term...) and IndexWriter.updateDocument(Term, Iterable<..docs..>) respectively \u2013 but Points based fields have no \"Term\" that can be based to these methods.\n\nIndexSchema.readSchema should fail fast in this case with a clear error (just like it does if the uniqueKey field is multivalued)",

That way we can enforce ID requirements (keyword analyzed, doc values for sorting, no point values) for the unique key field, and for root and parent and other special fields.  The schema for 7.0 detects if any of these fields aren't using the IDField type and emits a warning, and 8.0 errors out. ",
