    "description": "The facet module contains an interface called DocumentBuilder, which contains a single method, build(Document) (it's a builder API). We use it in my company to standardize how different modules populate a Document object. I've included it with the facet contribution so that things will compile with as few code changes as possible.\n\nNow it's time to do some cleanup and I'd like to start with this interface. If people think that this interface is useful to reside in 'core', then I don't mind moving it there. But otherwise, let's remove it from the code. It has only one impl in the facet module: CategoryDocumentBuilder, and we can certainly do without the interface.\n\nMore so, it's under o.a.l package which is inappropriate IMO. If it's moved to 'core', it should be under o.a.l.document.\n\nIf people see any problem with that, please speak up. I will do the changes and post a patch here shortly.",
