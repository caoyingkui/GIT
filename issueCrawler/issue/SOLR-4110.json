    "description": "The PHPResponseWriter and PHPSerializedResponseWriter currently send a hard coded Content-Type header of text/plain; charset=UTF-8 although there are constants defining text/x-php;charset=UTF-8 and text/x-php-serialized;charset=UTF-8 which remain unused. This makes content type guessing on the client side quite complicated.\n\nI already created a patch (from the branch_4x github branch) to use the respective constants and also added the possibility to configure the Content-Type header via solrconfig.xml (like in JSONResponseWriter).",

JSONResponseWriter already is (as far as Content-Type header in concerned).\nSending text/x-php;charset=UTF-8 as default however might be an issue, yes (if anyone really relies on text/plain for PHP and PHPs).\nBut since the Content-Type header of the ResponseWriters would be configurable you could still overwrite the defaults in solrconfig.xml just like the example does with the JSONResponseWriter:\n\n\n<queryResponseWriter name=\"json\" class=\"solr.JSONResponseWriter\">\n\t<!-- For the purposes of the tutorial, JSON responses are written as\n\t  plain text so that they are easy to read in *any* browser.\n\t  If you expect a MIME type of \"application/json\" just remove this override.\n\t-->\n\t<str name=\"content-type\">text/plain; charset=UTF-8</str>\n</queryResponseWriter>\n\n "
