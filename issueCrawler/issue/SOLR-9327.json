    "description": "The problem I am facing is that traversalFilter \"(-field:x)\" won't return any results even though it probably should.  \n\nMore information: I have set up a test core with all my fields stored in a text_general field. Default solrconfig. I have a simple chaining where im using from parameter as document id. And a to field storing all ids of each documents children. And the graph parser works fine, its just this kind of filter that does not work for me.\n\nI have documents with field with value a or b.\n\na query like this:\n\n```\nq=*\nfq=\n{!graph from=id to=to returnRoot=false traversalFilter=\"(field:b)\" }\nid:0\nThis query filters away any document and its children that does not have b as value on field.\n```\n\n```\n q=*\n    fq=\n{!graph from=id to=to returnRoot=false traversalFilter=\"(-field:b)\" }\nid:0\n```\nShould then work in the opposite. Filter away documents with b as value. But this does not work for some reason.\n\nfrom solrquerysyntax: https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrQuerySyntax\n\n\"Pure negative queries (all clauses prohibited) are allowed. -inStock:false finds all field values where inStock is not false.\" - I believe this should apply to traversalFilter as well for more dynamic filters.",
