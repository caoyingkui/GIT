This doesn't seem to be populated during the tests if I query the test cluster. I found the following from SystemInfoHandler and p.getSpecificationVersion() is null during the tests. When I query that same url on a running Solr server from a trunk build it works just fine.\n\n\nprivate static SimpleOrderedMap<Object> getLuceneInfo() {\n    SimpleOrderedMap<Object> info = new SimpleOrderedMap<>();\n\n    Package p = SolrCore.class.getPackage();\n\n    info.add( \"solr-spec-version\", p.getSpecificationVersion() );\n    info.add( \"solr-impl-version\", p.getImplementationVersion() );\n  \n    p = LucenePackage.class.getPackage();\n\n    info.add( \"lucene-spec-version\", p.getSpecificationVersion() );\n    info.add( \"lucene-impl-version\", p.getImplementationVersion() );\n\n    return info;\n  }\n\n\n\nI compared the solrconfig-sql.xml to the one that is the default shipped with Solr. So two questions:\n1) is the version not being populated since its not a full build?\n2) if #1 is true, what is a better way to query the Solr Cluster versions? ",
