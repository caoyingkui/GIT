    "description": "The overseer collection processor always uses PlainIdRouter to partition the hash range. However, some router implementations (most notably CompositeIdRouter) can provide a different implementation to partition hash ranges. So there can be a mismatch between the hash ranges which are persisted in clusterstate.xml for sub shards and the actual index which is split using the collection's configured router impl.\n\nThis bug does not affect collections using PlainIdRouter.\n\nThe overseer collection processor should always use the collection's configured router to partition ranges.",
