    "description": "To-parent block joins are a good fit for two-phase iteration. Currently the iterator implementation visits all child matches before returning a parent match. Instead, an approximation would only need to find one child match in order to return a potential parent match. This would make to-parent block joins more efficient when used in conjunctions.",

            "content": "Here is a patch that implements both scorerSupplier and twoPhaseIterator for to-parent block joins. It cannot be committed right now because it would cause bugs with ToParentBlockJoinCollector. The latter currently relies on the fact that if a sub scorer returns the current doc with the docId() method, then it means that it matches, which is not true with two-phase iteration. ",
