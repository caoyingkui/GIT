    "description": "The locale feature of VelocityResponseWriter is currently used to set the locale for the $resource tool.  However, there are some other tools that leverage the locale setting that are falling back to the default system locale.\n\nFor example, $number.format should allow $number.format(\"integer\",50000) to render the number in the v.locale specified locale but always uses the default system locale.  \n\nA workaround for number formatting is to use the $resource.locale setting like this:  $number.format(\"integer\",50000,$resource.locale)",

This patch also configures any custom tools that extend LocaleConfig too.  Also, $resource (SolrVelocityResourceTool) was refactored to have its locale configured similarly, now that I understand how LocaleConfig works. ",
