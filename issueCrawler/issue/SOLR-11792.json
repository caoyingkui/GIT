    "description": "If I create index with unique key defined like\n\n<field name=\"uid\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"false\" required=\"true\" docValues=\"true\"/>\n\n\n\nthen searches seem to be working, but tvrh doesn't return any vectors for fields that have one stored.\n\nUpon a cursory look at the code it looks like tvrh component requires unique key to be specifically stored.\n\nIdeally tvrh should work fine with docValues. And at the very least this gotcha should be documented, probably here: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/field-properties-by-use-case.html",
