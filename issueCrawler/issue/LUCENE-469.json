    "description": "Example: \nHits hits=multiSearcher.search(query);\nreturns different scores for some documents than\nHits hits=multiSearcher.search(query, Sort.RELEVANCE);\n(both for MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher)\n\nThe documents returned will be the same and in the same order, but the scores in the second case will seem out of order.\n\nInspecting the Explanation objects shows that the scores themselves are ok, but there's a bug in the normalization of the scores.\n\nThe document with the highest score should have score 1.0, so all document scores are divided by the highest score.  (Assuming the highest score was>1.0)\n\nHowever, for MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher, this normalization factor is applied per index, before merging the results together (the merge itself is ok though).\n\nAn example: if you use\nHits hits=multiSearcher.search(query, Sort.RELEVANCE);\nfor a MultiSearcher with two subsearchers, the first document will have score 1.0.\nThe next documents from the same subsearcher will have decreasing scores.\nThe first document from the other subsearcher will however have score 1.0 again !\n\nThe same applies for other Sort objects, but it is less visible.\n\nI will post a TestCase demonstrating the problem and suggested patches to solve it in a moment...",

If they did, well, they're experts, right? \n\nThis is my complete patch to correct the problem and I do indeed propose to add a field maxScore to TopDocs that is used in Hits to normalize the results at as the very last step.\n\nAll the TestCases pass after applying this patch.

Although this is a great way to test if we got all the cases within Lucene, if anyone created their own instances outside lucene, it would break backward compatibility.  This is beyond expert level though... so perhaps it shouldn't worry us.\n\n\n\n\n\tI'm not sure if the MultiSearcher implementation is correct for other Sorts.\n  FieldDocSortedHitQueue.getMaxScore() is only the max score of docs inserted... I think you need to reference  docs.maxScore() rather than relying on the  FieldDocSortedHitQueue in this case, right?\n\n ",

I could add the old constructor again with a @deprecated tag that sets maxScore to 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\tOther Sorts: You are right, I made a mistake by concentrating too much on the Sort.RELEVANCE case.
