    "description": "Inspired by a conversation i had with someone on IRC a while back about using \"append\" fq params + local params to create custom request params, it occurred to me that it would be handy to have a \"switch\" qparser that could be configured with some set of fixed \"switch case\" localparams that it would delegate too based on it's input string.",

            "content": "Patch for review (includes docs & tests).\n\nsome example usages straight from javadocs...\n\n\n In the examples below, the result of each query would be XXX....\n\n q = {!switch s.foo=XXX s.bar=zzz s.yak=qqq}foo\n q = {!switch s.foo=qqq s.bar=XXX s.yak=zzz} bar     // extra whitespace\n q = {!switch defSwitch=XXX s.foo=qqq s.bar=zzz}asdf // fallback on defSwitch\n q = {!switch s=XXX s.bar=zzz s.yak=qqq}             // blank input\n\n\n\n\n A practical usage of this QParsePlugin, is in specifying \"appends\" fq params in the configuration of a SearchHandler, to provide a fixed set of filter options for clients using custom parameter names. Using the example configuration below, clients can optionally specify the custom parameters in_stock and shipping to override the default filtering behavior, but are limited to the specific set of legal values (shipping=any|free, in_stock=yes|no|all).\n\n\n <requestHandler name=\"/select\" class=\"solr.SearchHandler\">\n   <lst name=\"defaults\">\n     <str name=\"in_stock\">yes</str>\n     <str name=\"shipping\">any</str>\n   </lst>\n   <lst name=\"appends\">\n     <str name=\"fq\">{!switch s.all='*:*'\n                             s.yes='inStock:true'\n                             s.no='inStock:false'\n                             v=$in_stock}</str>\n     <str name=\"fq\">{!switch s.any='*:*'\n                             s.free='shipping_cost:0.0'\n                             v=$shipping}</str>\n   </lst>\n </requestHandler>\n\n\n "

            "content": "Feedback from jan on twitter...\n\n\nLooks good, or a more verbose: {!switch case.yes='inStock:true' default='foo'}, or c.yes='\u2026' where c short for case?\n\nI think using \"case\" instead of \"s\" and \"default\" instead of \"defSwitch\" makes a lot of sense ... my initial thinking was that the parser could consult both the localparams and the request params (before i realized that was too risky because clients could define their own cases) so i wanted the param names to be clearly related to \"switch\". \n\nMy chief concern is about the difference between the \"blank\" case, and the \"default\" case when nothing matches, and wether people will be confused by the difference in meaning.  ie: is it obvious to folks at a glance what each of these produce...\n\n\n{!switch case=XXX case.foo=YYY case=ZZZ default=QQQ v='    '}              // XXX\n{!switch case=XXX case.foo=YYY case=ZZZ default=QQQ v='case'}              // QQQ\n\n\n\n...is that confusing? would it perhaps be better to have an explicit \"blank\" (or \"empty\" param name instead of using \"case\" as both a prefix & a param?\n "
