    "description": "It would be great to have support for something like ant precommit -Dtop=3 which would look at the files changed by the last 3 (local) commits and then based on that information intelligently skip some of the precommit checks.\n\nExamples:\n\n\tIf the code changes are all in lucene/analysis then lucene/core need not be checked for forbidden API use.\n\tIf the code changes are all in solr then the documentation checks need not be run for lucene code - is that correct?\n\tIf the code changes consist of just code removals then forbidden API checks are not required but documentation lint checks would be needed.\n\n\n\nThe objective would be to intelligently reduce the time taken for precommit checks without impact on the quality of the checks done.",
