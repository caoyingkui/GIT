    "description": "It can be useful to put the elisionfilterfactory before WDF to prevent super-slow phrase queries,\nbut it doesn't let you set ignoreCase on the chararrayset.\n\nthis is useful so that you can still get the splitOnCaseChange behavior, but have case-insensitive elision removal.\n\nConfusingly, if you DONT supply your own contractions list, it will use the default list of french contractions,\nand these will ignore case, but if you supply your own, there is no way to configure this.",
