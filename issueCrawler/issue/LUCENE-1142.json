We are, again, in that tricky spot of how to handle changes where the API is compatible, but the index can change.\n\nOne thing to check, maybe, is how many terms are going to be affected?   Maybe we put this in now and we mark it in CHANGES.txt that users of Snowball will need to re-index, or at least thoroughly test to see if there are any issues in their setup.  \n\nI can go either way.

            "content": "One other thought on this, and I think it is consistent w/ how we've handled other token changes is to do the upgrade, mark it in the CHANGES.txt clearly per the http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BackwardsCompatibility and to also note that to retain the old behavior, one needs to drop in the old jars.  \n\nCould this work?  I haven't tried it, but it seems like it could, except for your one comment above about the use of reflection.  Of course, there may be a way around that too.\n\nAdditionally, we have an out in that the back compat. link above says:\n\n\"All contribs are not created equal.\"\n\nThe compatibility commitments of a contrib package can vary based on it's maturity and intended usage. The README.txt file for each contrib should identify it's approach to compatibility. If the README.txt file for a contrib package does not address it's backwards compatibility commitments users should assume it does not make any compatibility commitments. \n\nThus, I think we should include this for 2.4 and we should note it in CHANGES.txt and in the Snowball README.
