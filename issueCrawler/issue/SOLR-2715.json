            "content": "Since i got sucked into looking at the JMX tests yesterday, i spent 24+ hours digging into this too see if i could resolve it as well.\n\nAfter re-working hte test to do an apples to apples test instead of comparing JMX with the infoRegistery (to decouple from the problems mentioned in SOLR-5095) i was still seeing extremely sporadic failures (off by one) from the this reload test.\n\nat first i thought perhaps this was a timing issue related to core reload blocking and updated the test accordingly \u2013 but that didn't seem to have any effect.  Then i realized that there were some overlapping searchers happening in the test (not sure why exactly: no commits happening) and i realized that since we register searchers with multiple names (\"currentSearcher\" for general monitoring and \"Searcher@<id>\" for specific checks) that could cause a problem during the overlap period.  When i excluded them from the count, i couldn't reproduce those failures anymore, but i did start seeing InstanceNotFoundException exceptions when looking at caches \u2013 which also makes sense in an onDeck searcher situation since it also re-registers the caches.\n\nSo i think this patch should get things to the point where the meat of the goal (ensuring everything is reregistered after core reload) is still testted, but we shoulnd't get sporadic failures.\n\nwould appreciate if folks could let me know if they can get any failures from this patch...\n\n\nant test -Dtests.failfast=yes -Dtests.iters=10000 -Dtestcase=TestJmxIntegration -Dtests.method=testJmxOnCoreReload\\*\n\n "
