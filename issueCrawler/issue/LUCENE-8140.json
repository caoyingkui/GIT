The situation is as follows:\n\nHaving three points A, B, & C and the distance between A & B is very small compared to the distance between A & C, then the plane AC contains all points (co-planar) but the plane defined by AB does not contain C because of numerical issues. This situation makes some polygons fail to build.",

Please also commit to branch_6x and branch_7x when you do.\n\nSecond, about recursion when there are a lot of edges \u2013 beyond a few hundred edges, the performance of GeoComplexPolygon far exceeds the performance of the tiled polygon approach.  That's why it was written.  If your polygons have enough edges to cause stack overflows with recursion  then I suggest you use GeoComplexPolygon instead. ",
