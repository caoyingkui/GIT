    "description": "OK, I think I've found a possible reason. The waitForDocCount method waits until a response comes back with the, well, expected doc counts. But then it drops out of the wait loop the first time a query works.\n\nBut then it goes out to each and every node and re-issues the request. This looks to be a 2-shard, 2-replica situation. So here's the theory: the second node hasn't yet opened a new searcher. So the wait loop is satisfied by, say, node2 but the test later looks at node4 (both for shard2) which hasn't completed opening a searcher yet so it fails.\n\nI could not get this to fail locally in 20 runs. So I'll beast the unchanged version some more to see but meanwhile commit this change which I think is more correct anyway and monitor.",

So I don't see any other choice than to commit this test fix and see if it happens again.\n\nI'll keep this JIRA open for a day or two and then close it if we don't see the problem again.\n\nI don't think this really requires a CHANGES.txt entry so if we package up 6.0 and 5.5  ",
