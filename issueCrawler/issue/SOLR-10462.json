    "description": "Now that builders are in place for SolrClients, the setters used in each SolrClient can be deprecated, and their functionality moved over to the Builders. This change brings a few benefits:\n\n\n\tunifies SolrClient configuration under the new Builders. It'll be nice to have all the knobs, and levers used to tweak {{SolrClient}}s available in a single place (the Builders).\n\treduces SolrClient thread-safety concerns. Currently, clients are mutable. Using some SolrClient setters can result in erratic and \"trappy\" behavior when the clients are used across multiple threads.\n\n\n\nThis subtask endeavors to change this behavior for the setPollQueueTime setter on all SolrClient implementations.",
