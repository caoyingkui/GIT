It just seems like that as we add new methods of creating documents in the future, \"dangerous\" params could proliferate.  Seems like it may be easier to enumerate those params that are necessary/desirable for updates.\n\nBrainstorming off the top of my head:\n\n\tParams for updates: commitWithin, NOW?\n\tParams for commits: softCommit, waitSearcher?\n\n "
