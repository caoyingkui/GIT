The benefit is twofold - better out-of-the-box source for copy-pasting and a clear indication where overridden resources must be located.\n\nWe should provide the defaults for Lingo, STC and kmeans perhaps.\n\nAnother thing is that LEXICAL_RESOURCES_DIR no longer reflects the true purpose of that folder... perhaps it should be aliased to something more sensible.
