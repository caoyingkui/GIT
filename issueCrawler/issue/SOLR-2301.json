Referring to SOLR-2286 \n\nAnyway, the CDC has a list of RSS feeds that the Solr dataimporter can't work with\n\nHome page:\nhttp://emergency.cdc.gov/rss/\n\nPage to Index:\nhttp://www2a.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=19\n\nThe console reports the following and as you can see it's because it does not like the param \"c\".

Any thoughts on that?\n\nManifoldCF has always been integrated with Solr.  The only thing missing is a Solr SearchComponent that enforces document security.  There is a Solr ticket and a patch that provides that SearchComponent for people willing to build it themselves.  But you don't need any of that to do a simple RSS crawl, indexing into Solr.\n\nDownload the current ManifoldCF 0.1 release candidate from http://people.apache.org/~kwright, and unpack.  Follow the readme directions for using the quick-start example.  Set up a Solr output connection, and an RSS repository connection, and create a job using these connections.  If you need help in doing that, the online documentation should assist you. "
