Logs a warning and disables replication in case both master and slave are enable:false in config.\n\nI'd ideally like to unregister the replication handler from SolrCore, as if it had enable=false on the top level. But I cannot find a way to do it. The problem is that even with this patch, the handler API is active and serving wrong info. "

            "content": "removing fixVersion=4.0 since there is no evidence that anyone is currently working on this issue.  (this can certainly be revisited if volunteers step forward)\n\nNote also: i'm not sure this issue is even a good idea anymore, as ReplicationHandler is now also used for SolrCloud, where it doesn't have to be explicitly configured as either a master or a slave.  The current 4x example solrconfig includes a ReplicationHandler that looks like this...\n\n\n  <requestHandler name=\"/replication\" class=\"solr.ReplicationHandler\" > \n    <!--\n       To enable simple master/slave replication, uncomment one of the \n       sections below, depending on wether this solr instance should be \n       the \"master\" or a \"slave\".  If this instance is a \"slave\" you will \n       also need to fill in the masterUrl to point to a real machine.\n    -->\n    <!--\n       <lst name=\"master\">\n         <str name=\"replicateAfter\">commit</str>\n         <str name=\"replicateAfter\">startup</str>\n         <str name=\"confFiles\">schema.xml,stopwords.txt</str>\n       </lst>\n    -->\n    <!--\n       <lst name=\"slave\">\n         <str name=\"masterUrl\">http://your-master-hostname:8983/solr</str>\n         <str name=\"pollInterval\">00:00:60</str>\n       </lst>\n    -->\n  </requestHandler>\n\n\n\nI would think that at a minimum, any logic for disabling replication if there is no master/slave config should only do so if we are not in \"ZooKeeperMode\" "
