    "description": "This is a followup of LUCENE-1935: ScorerDocQueue currently duplicates lots of code from PQ. Using the new generics in PQ since 1935, it is possible to subclass it from generic typed PriorityQueue<HeapedScorerDoc>. This class only needs to add some of the special methods, and should have the same API as before, as it is public.",
