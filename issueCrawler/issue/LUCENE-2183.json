The patch preserves full backwards compat and provides a clean way to move towards a consistent codepoint based API with would still provide the flexibility to make use of the old and buggy behavior even if the char based methods are removed.\n\nI consider this patch as a basis for the discussion how to solve this problem. other approaches would be using reflection like the TokenStream BWCompat layer does but I personally prefer not to use reflection and rather use delegation in favor of inheritance.\n\nlooking forward to see some comments.

I think we could also reuse this code to fix some unrelated problems in the n-gram tokenizers (at a glance, i do not see how the n-gram tokenizer io-handling even works correctly at all) ",

            "content": "Hello Simon, another option very similar to yours (I am not sure if it really would work, but just thinking out loud somewhat) could be:\n\n\n/** this method will be declared abstract in Lucene 4.0 */\npublic int isTokenChar(int ch) {\n  throw UOE();\n}\n\n/** @deprecated will be removed in Lucene 4.0 */\npublic int isTokenChar(char ch) {\n  return isTokenChar((int)ch);\n}\n\n\n\nand do the same for normalize(). The rest would be the same as your patch:\n\n\tUse CharacterUtils for io-buffering\n\tUse CharacterUtils for character/codepoint iteration.\n\tUse Version to decide which method to call instead of reflection: this should not be conditional upon each call to isTokenChar() but instead two private inner classes or whatever.\n\n\n\nThe difference would be that the api would appear more natural in my opinion, and once deprecations are removed we would end out with an abstract class with the int-equivalent of what we have now.\n\nIf someone attempts to use a CharTokenizer that does not support int-based methods (only implements the char-based methods) with Version.LUCENE_31 then this would throw UOE, which in my opinion is correct, as it does not support the behavior of that version.\n\nedit: I changed the deprecation of isTokenChar(char) to 4.0. The index back compat would still exist because using CharacterUtils with isTokenChar(int) is the same thing. ",

            "content": "Hey guys thanks for your comments.\nwhen I started thinking about this issue I had a quick chat with robert and we figured that his solution could be working so I implemented it.\nYet, i found 2 problems with it.\n1. If a user calls super.isTokenChar(char) and the super class has implemented the int method the UOE will never be thrown and the code does not behave like \"expected\" from the user perspective. - This is what robert explained above. We could solve this problem with reflection which leads to the second problem.\n\n2. If a Tokenizer like LowerCaseTokenizer only overrides normalize(char|int) it relies on the superclass implementation of isTokenChar. Yet if we solve problem 1. the user would be forced to override the isTokenChar to just call super.isTokenChar otherwise the reflection code will raise an exception that the int method is not implemented in the concrete class or will use the char API - anyway it will not do what is expected. \n\nWorking around those two problem was the cause of a new API for CharTokenizer. My personal opinion is that inheritance is the wrong tool for changing behavior I used delegation (like a strategy) to on the one hand define a clear \"new\" API and decouple the code changing the behavior of the Tokenizer from the tokenizer itself. Inheritance for me is for extending a class and delegation is for changing behavior in this particular problem. \nDecoupling the old from the new has several advantages over a reflection / inheritance based solution. \n1. if a user does not provide a delegation impl he want to use the old API\n2. if a user does provide a delegation impl he has still the ability to choose between charprocessing in 3.0 style or 3.1 style\n3. no matter what is provided a user has full flexibility to choose the combination of their choice - old char processing - new int based api (maybe minor though)\n4. we can leave all tokeinizer subclasses as their are and define new functions that implement their behavior in parallel. those functions can be made final from the beginning and which prevents users from subclassing them. (all of the existing ones should be final in my opinion - like LowerCaseTokenizer which should call Character.isLetter in the isTokenCodePoint(int) directly instead of subclassing another function.)\n\nAs a user I would expect lucene to revise their design decisions made years ago when there is a need for it like we have in this issue. It is easier to change behavior in user code by swapping to a new api instead of diggin into an workaround implementation of an old api silently calling a new API.\n ",

            "content": "hello, a few very minor nitpicks:\n\n\tit seems the javadoc for isTokenChar()/isTokenInt() is backwards, the int-based api refers to 'character' but the char-based api refers to codepoint (which is wrong). perhaps it would be best to refer to all char-based methods as working on 'utf-16 code unit' and int-based apis as 'codepoint'.\n\twe might want to insert a note/warning on the char-based methods, consistent with the JDK javadocs, \"Note this method cannot handle supplementary characters...\" for example, like: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#getType%28char%29 I think its important to include the link to the JDK explanation of what a supplementary character is, also. http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#supplementary\n\tif possible we might want to include some class-level wordage on how the whole thing works. If you implement the int-based API, you can use your class with all Lucene Versions, and bw layer will make it work correctly with old indexes. If you only stay with the char-based API, then you can only use your CharTokenizer for Version <= 3.0. We can also mention it is unnecessary to implement both, only the int-based api!!!\n\n\n\nsorry for being picky about the javadocs, trying to think of ways to prevent confusion on the user list, as i anticipate a bunch of people probably just use Version.LUCENE_CURRENT and have no idea what a supplementary character is.\n\ngreat work.
