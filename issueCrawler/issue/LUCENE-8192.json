            "content": "I wrote a patch to do this, but it causes many tests to fail.\n\nI think this boolean currently mixes up two concerns:\n\n\n\t\"correct offsets\" as far as what IndexWriter will check. This is the useless boolean, its mandatory that the tokenstream behave correctly here or its basically broke.\n\t\"graph offsets checks\". This seems to be a higher bar, and even tests for filters that claim to support graphs (SynonymGraphFilter) screw this up?\n\n\n\nJust at a glance, it seems like we want to separate these concerns. The first one should not be optional. ",

            "content": "Second, less aggressive patch: it changes the boolean from offsetsAreCorrect to graphOffsetsAreCorrect and always enables the checks consistent with what indexwriter will do (e.g. offsets don't go backwards).\n\nI ran tests a couple times and nothing failed... probably deserves some beasting but I think this is a good step? It removes some useless leniency. ",
