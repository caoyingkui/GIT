SolrJ and Solr-Server both in version 4.6.1.\nserverCloud =  new CloudSolrServer(zkHost);\nMy JUnit starts with a deleteByQuery. In DocRouter.java:46 a SolrException is thrown because \nrouterMap.get(routerSpec);\nfinds no entry.\nHints:\nrouterSpec is an instance of LinkedHashMap<K,V> with one entry (key:\"name\", value:\"compositeId\").\n\nrouterMap is a HashMap<K,V> holding 4 entries, especially key:\"compositeId\" has value: \" org.apache.solr.common.cloud.CompositeIdRouter\".\n\nProbably there is a type mismatch at the routerMap.get call.",
