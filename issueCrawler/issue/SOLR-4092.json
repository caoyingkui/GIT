            "content": "In order to be affected by this, the user must be running running Solr 4.1 with no ramBufferSizeMB in their config.\n\nWith the Solr upgrade from 3.x, Solr's memory footprint will be drastically altered no matter what happens with the default ramBufferSizeMB.  In many cases that footprint will be significantly smaller than it was before, so any change from this increase may be in the noise.  The user may be surprised by new index segments that are suddenly much larger, but since it comes with better performance, I doubt there would be any major fallout.\n\nMy bias is to change the test, and leave ramBufferSizeMB at 100 for all luceneMatchVersion values.  Or you could appeal to binary perfection and make it 128.  "
