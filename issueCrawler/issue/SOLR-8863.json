    "description": "I was thinking about what somebody has to do if they want to replace a single file in a specific SolrCloud configuration.  This and other operations could be easier with some tweaks to the zkcli program.\n\nI'd like to have some options to do things like the following, and other combinations not specifically stated here:\n\n\n\tUpload the file named solrconfig.xml to the 'foo' config.\n\tUpload the file named solrconfig.xml to the config used by the 'bar' collection.\n\tDownload the file named stopwords.txt from the config used by the 'bar' collection.\n\tRename schema.xml to managed-schema in the 'foo' config.\n\tDelete archaic_stopwords.txt from the config used by the 'bar' collection.\n\n\n\nWhen a config is changed, it would be a good idea for the program to print out a list of all collections affected by the change.  I can imagine a \"-interactive\" option that asks \"are you sure\" after printing the affected collection list, and a \"-dry-run\" option to print out that information without actually doing anything.  An alternative to the interactive option \u2013 have the program prompt by default and implement a \"-force\" option to do it without prompting.\n\nI wonder whether it would be a good idea to include an option to reload all affected collections after a change is made.  The script uses WEB-INF/lib on the classpath, so SolrJ should be available.",
