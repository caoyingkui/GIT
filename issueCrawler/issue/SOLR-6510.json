On trunk the line 230 call has been replaced (by LUCENE-5666) and so the CollapsingQParserPlugin part of the patch is not required.\n\n    The TestCollapseQParserPlugin change could go to branch_4x only or branch_4x and trunk.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/bloomberg/lucene-solr branch_4x-collapse-empty\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/94.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #94\n\n\ncommit 5e2968541221307a6ca7b397c61a040289421ac1\nAuthor: Christine Poerschke <cpoerschke@bloomberg.net>\nDate:   2014-09-05T17:00:38Z\n\n    solr: select?collapse=... - fix NPE in Collapsing(FieldValue|Score)Collector\n\n "

If that works, I'll just remove the direct call to AtomicReader.getSortedDocValues(), which was probably never needed in the first place. "

The CollapsingQParserPlugin has a different implementation for 5.0 that uses the DocValues class, which I believe does not have this issue.\n\nMore testing needs to be done with 5.0 implementation to understand the full effect of this change. The change was made as part of a large patch when the new DocValues class was introduced to Lucene.\n\nI'll open another ticket as a review for the CollapsingQParserPlugin 5.0. \n\nWe can probably close this ticket though.
