    "description": "Both of these fields quantize doubles in a lossy way, but GeoPoint rounds towards negative infinity (because all values get shifted to positive space first), whereas LatLonPoint currently rounds towards zero.\n\nAt the same time they share the same basic logic for e.g. tree traversal and same basic tests: so it creates confusion that they round differently.\n\nEspecially since e.g. LatLonPoint does some operations in binary/integer space (some of these optimizations such as its box query are currently buggy for edge cases, and tests are lenient as TODO, another issue, may or may not impact GeoPoint, it at least tries harder).\n\nI think LatLonPoint should round down to be more like GeoPoint here? By the way, doing this also gives more consistency, it reduces the difference between the two implementations in e.g. openstreetmaps searching (distance query benchmark now differs by only 4 hits...)\n\nThis quantization makes things complicated to reason about. I understand the advantages it brings but I think along with that comes the responsibility of us handling edge cases better. I don't think we do well at this today...",
