    "description": "FileListEntityProcessor uses fileNamePattern.matcher(name).find() to check if a file matches the pattern. This probably makes it match too much for what the (ordinary) user wants since that effectively means that if the filename contains the pattern the file will match. As a user you usually expect the pattern to match all of the filename and not having to use ^ and $ explicitly. For instance appending \".old\" or prepending \"test_20100101_\"  to your filename for old or test copies wont work  since all files will be processed and confusion usually follows.\nEither the documentation should be updated to note that extra care is needed for the file pattern or the usage of find() should be replaced with Pattern.matches().",
