In addition to testing, documentation is also needed (detecting-languages-during-indexing.adoc).\n\nFor IntelliJ with this patch, the langid.iml needs to add a dependency on the analysis-common module:\n\n\n+    <orderEntry type=\"module\" module-name=\"analysis-common\" />\n\n\n\nAbout your TODO:\n\n\n        // TODO: not sure *100 is appropriate...\n        languages.add(new DetectedLanguage(language.getLang(), language.getConfidence() * 100));\n\n\n\nDetectedLanguage.getCertainty() javadoc says:\n\n\n  /**\n   * Returns the detected certainty for this language\n   * @return certainty as a value between 0.0 and 1.0 where 1.0 is 100% certain\n   */\n\n\n\nSo I think *100 is inappropriate.
