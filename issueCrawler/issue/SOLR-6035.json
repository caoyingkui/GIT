    "description": "In a multisharded node environment we were seeing forward-to-leader hops when using CloudSolrServer directUpdate (with the hop being on the same node) . Consequently, there was no improvement in indexing performance over non-directUpdate. \n\nChanging buildUrlMap to use getCoreUrl eliminated the extra hop and now we see a dramatic improvement in performance.",

For exampe, does replication within the shard still happen if you go directly to the coreUrl. "

If there are two leaders from the same collection in the same Solr instance then it could pick the wrong leader and this would cause the routing on the server side.\n\nAll tests are passing with the patch. I'll do some manual testing, but so far so good.\n\nMark, let me know if you think I'm missing something. "
