Here's an API that uses both notations:\n\nhttps://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_4/collections-api.html#create-parameters\n\nThat API even has parameters that use both forms at the same time: createNodeSet.shuffle and collection.configName are examples.\n\nWe need to standardize on one notation, simplify the names where possible, and deprecate non-conforming parameters.",
