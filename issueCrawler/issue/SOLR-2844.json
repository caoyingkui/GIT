    "description": "Our primary use case for SolrJ is to feed data into solr. We commonly use an adapter design pattern in our presentation or export layer in the application. E.g. an adapter to flatten structured relational data for books for an solr import might look like this:\n\nclass Book {\n\n  BookEntity book;\n\n  public String getTitle() \n{ return book.getTitle(); }\n  public String getAuthorName() { return book.getAuthor().getName(); }\n  public Double getMinimumPrice( { return priceService.calculateMinimumPrice(book); }\n\n}\n\nThis is not working currently, because a setter has to be specified. So the workaround is to write this code:\n\nclass Book {\n\n  BookEntity book;\n\n  public String getTitle() { return book.getTitle(); }\n  @Field public void setTitle(String s) { }\n  public String getAuthorName() \n{ return book.getAuthor().getName(); }\n  @Field public void setAutherName(String s) { }\n  public Double getMinimumPrice( \n{ return priceService.calculateMinimumPrice(book); }\n  @Field public void setMinimumPrice(Double d) { }\n\n}\n\nSo the scope of this improvement is to get rid of the dummy setters and to support @Field on getters directly.\n\nI will add a patch proposal for this later on.",
