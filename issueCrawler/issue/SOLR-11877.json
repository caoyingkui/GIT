    "description": "The ability to know what the collection / ClusterState\u00a0\"stateFormat\" integer is per collection is a bit buggy. \u00a0After looking at the problem for awhile, I think it would help a lot if DocCollection accepted the stateFormat param to thus force the caller to consider it. \u00a0Today the caller passes the znode path... but in\u00a0several places we pass ZkStateReader.CLUSTER_STATE or null (both implying stateFormat==1) which is sometimes not accurate. \u00a0Nobody seems to actually need the znode path from the DocCollection but the stateFormat is requested in a bunch of places.\n\nThe particular bug I see is org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.HttpClusterStateProvider#fetchClusterState passing ZkStateReader.CLUSTER_STATE when in reality it has no clue what the format is because our cluster_status API doesn't return the stateFormat.\n\nMaybe getStateFormat should return an Integer object and hence can be null if it's not known.",
