With the patch we check if the replica is active, we should also also check if the replica's nodeName belongs in the live nodes list. This is required for a scenario like this - Someone kills the node using \"kill -9 <pid>\" / OOM crash . In the cluster state that replica will still show us \"active\". HttpSolrCall#getCoreByCollection does the same thing \n2. Maybe move the code into a function - say \"getActiveReplicasForCollection\" ? The both CloudSolrStream and ParallelSteam can reuse it. ",

In CloudSolrStream, for each collection we will randomly find a replica per shard. ",
