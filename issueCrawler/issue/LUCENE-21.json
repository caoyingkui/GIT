For example, the search \nexpression: \nfreedent OR trident \nreturns 0 matches. However just searching on freedent returns several matches. \nSearching on trident returns 0 matches.",

This is \nprobably as expected because of operator precedence. Changing it to:\n(freedent OR trident) AND peppermint\nseems to work.\n\nSo, I am closing this bug as invalid. ",
