    "description": "*********Original issue:\nIf I specify:\n\nhl.fl=f1&hl.q=something\n\nthen \"something\" is analyzed against the default field rather than f1\n\nSo in this particular case, f1 did some diacritic folding\n(GermanNormalizationFilterFactory specifically). But my guess is that\nthe df was still \"text\", or at least something that didn't reference\nthat filter.\n\nI'm defining \"worked\" in what follows is getting highlighting on \"K\u00fcndigung\"\n\nso\nK\u00fcndigung was indexed as Kundigung\n\nSo far so good. Now if I try to highlight on f1\n\nThese work\nq=f1:K\u00fcndigung&hl.fl=f1\nq=f1:K\u00fcndigung&hl.fl=f1&hl.q=Kundigung <= NOTE, without umlaut\nq=f1:K\u00fcndigung&hl.fl=f1&hl.q=f1:K\u00fcndigung <= NOTE, with umlaut\n\nThis does not work\nq=f1:K\u00fcndigung&hl.fl=f1&hl.q=K\u00fcndigung <= NOTE, with umlaut\n\nTesting this locally, I'd get the highlighting if I defined df as \"f1\"\nin all the above cases.\n\n**********David Smiley's analysis\nBTW hl.q is parsed by the hl.qparser param which defaults to the defType param which defaults to \"lucene\".\n\nIn common cases, I think this is a non-issue.  One common case is defType=edismax and you specify a list of fields in 'qf' (thus your query has parts parsed on various fields) and then you set hl.fl to some subset of those fields.  This will use the correct analysis.\n\nYou make a compelling point in terms of what a user might expect \u2013 my gut reaction aligned with your expectation and I thought maybe we should change this.  But it's not as easy at it seems at first blush, and there are bad performance implications.  How do you generically tell an arbitrary query parser which field it should parse the string with?  We have no such standard.  And lets say we did; then we'd have to re-parse the query string for each field in hl.fl (and consider hl.fl might be a wildcard!).  Perhaps both solveable or constrainable with yet more parameters, but I'm pessimistic it'll be a better outcome.\n\nThe documentation ought to clarify this matter.  Probably in hl.fl to say that the fields listed are analyzed with that of their field type, and that it ought to be \"compatible\" (the same or similar) to that which parsed the query.\n\nPerhaps, like spellcheck's spellcheck.collateParam.* param prefix, highlighting could add a means to specify additional parameters for hl.q to be parsed (not just the choice of query parsers).  This isn't particularly pressing though since this can easily be added to the front of hl.q like hl.q=\n{!edismax qf=$hl.fl v=$q}",

            "content": "Eh; I kinda disagree with this patch & commit. hl.q doesn't need any further explanation (IMO) of how it's parsed; the following hl.qparser is there to say that it parses hl.q. And your query example IMO is composed in a way that I would not recommend since it gets them into the messy business of composing Lucene syntax queries by reprocessing the user's query, which can be avoided here.\n\nPerhaps all we need is for hl.qparser, at the end of it's existing explanation, to show how it might be used (with a new hl.q) to supply a different set of fields for the query parser. e.g. hl.qparser=lucene&hl.q={!edismax qf=$hl.fl v=$q}&hl.requireFieldMatch=true and of course verify first that it actually works. Even the \"edismax\" there could be done by reference using type=$defType but it might confuse the user more and is dubious since the example already assumes use of one of edismax's parameters. ",
