    "description": "Admin UI currently allows to create new fields based on pre-defined types. However, it does not allow to define new types themselves. This means that \"managed schema\" still needs to be edited by hand to add missing field types or a fairly complicated type-creation API needs to be used.\n\nOne of the challenges in creating UI is due to current analyzer components not being self-described in regards to the parameters they take. So, choosing and implementing self-description mechanism is part of this.\n\nAdditionally, Analysis screen could be extended to show how a type being designed would process text to significantly speed up evaluation of analyzer chain design for custom purposes.",
