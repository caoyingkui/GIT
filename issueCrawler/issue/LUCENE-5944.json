In general there is no problem in releasing 4.10.2 quite soon, too.\n\nThe fact we agreed on was to move to a new backwards model, because the current model prevents us from working effectively. So I don't see a 4.11 release coming anymore. Robert and I added a lot of news for a coming 5.0, which we will hopefully start as RC quite soon (after a few weeks of fine-tuning). The new version will still be able to read 4.x indexes, but 3.x gets removed.\n\nThe branch_4x branch was removed because commit to 4.x should now only go through 4.10 branch and all work for 5.0 will go to branch_5x. The whole thing was just a \"rename\" of branch. Both branches coexisted for a short time to be able to get Jenkins servers up-to-date.\n\nIn addition: SVN never forgets, you can reactivate branch_4x quite easy by reverting the removal commit. But I would not be happy and will spend no time in releasing a 4.11 instead of 5.0. ",

Having a tighter backcompat policy in the future (now starting with 6.x I guess) would help us do releases more quickly (IMO, around every year or a little more). See LUCENE-5940 that Uwe mentioned earlier here.

Every single recent 4.x release has serious corruption issues due to 3.x support: I am seeing these on a near daily basis. with the most recent release, lucene is even corrupting 4.x indexes because of the complexity of 3.x support. its not just a finite set of bugs for us to fix, its just too much complexity.\n\nAnd we shouldn't make 5.0 require java 8... but at the same time developers who want to use java 8 features can have trunk to do that.
