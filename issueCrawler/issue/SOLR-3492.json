    "description": "The caching of ReversedWildcardFilterFactory in SolrQueryParser looks broken.\n\nHere's the current code:\n\nReversedWildcardFilterFactory fac = leadingWildcards.get(fieldType);\nif (fac == null && leadingWildcards.containsKey(fac)) {\n  return fac;\n}\n\n\nThat doesn't quite make sense - fac will never be returned, as leadingWildcards will never contain a null key. I think this is probably what was intended:\n\nReversedWildcardFilterFactory fac = leadingWildcards.get(fieldType);\nif (fac != null) {\n  return fac;\n}",
