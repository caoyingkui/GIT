Whoever is planning to do the work should give the current 3.5 beta a spin and see whether code changes are required in order to achieve their goals and keep ZK functionality working.  If they are, they can keep those changes in a local repository (or a patch uploaded here) and then complete the change once the stable version is released. ",

Some Jenkins testing would be a good idea, since ZK is a VERY slow-moving beast.\n\nWhich sends me on a tangent ... I wonder if maybe we can come up with annotations for tests that designate them as \"Cloud\" tests or \"ZK\" tests, so we can send a commandline option to ant that will signal it to only run those tests.
