    "description": "I am using a configuration roughly as follows:\n\n       <bool name=\"hl.usePhraseHighlighter\">true</bool>\n       <bool name=\"hl.highlightMultiTerm\">true</bool>\n       <int name=\"hl.snippets\">4</int>\n       <bool name=\"hl.mergeContiguous\">true</bool>\n\nI found a strange case as follows:\nI have only one hit in the field, so I expect that no merging will take place. However, solr returns a highlight snippet of length 400. In effect, it calculates the hl.snippet size times 100. With hl.snippet=10, the length is 1000. I think it is because hl.fragsize is 100 by default.\n\nThis occurs only if the hit is sufficiently close to the beginning of the field's text - that is, if it is between the 300th and 400th character. In that change, the first four 100-block size snippets are merged as if all of them have a hit.\n\nThis behavior is wrong, and if there is only one hit, I don't expect solr to merge anything for me.",
