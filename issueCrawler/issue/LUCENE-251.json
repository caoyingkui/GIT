If you are indexing Chinese, use StandardAnalyzer\nor CJKAnalyzer from Lucene Sandbox (link is on the Lucene site).  Are you using\none of those?\n\nYou have to make sure you use the same Analyzer for searching, too.  How are you\nsearching your index?\n\nPlease show us some code or a unit test, if you can. ",
