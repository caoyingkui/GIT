            "content": "Exactly.\n\nBasically all these integration tests worked with Solr 1.4, but with Solr 4.1, the \"test_delta_import_when_never_indexed\" had to be disabled.\nhttp://pastebin.com/PDnHv2M2\n\nThe content of the dataimport.properties file itself is not wrong: it does contain the dates in the good format. The matter is that when the file doesn't exist yet, or doesn't contain all regular entries, when requesting a LAST_INDEX_TIME from this file, there is a fallback to the EPOCH date for bootstrapping, but the date is added to the map as Date and not as a formatted String.\n\n\nThe fix could simply be:\n\n\nindexerNamespace.put(LAST_INDEX_TIME, getSimplePropertiesWriterDateFormat().format(EPOCH) );\n\n\n\nSo that both the persisted date retrieval and a date retrieval miss with fallback to timestamp=0 will provide the same kind of formatted date to the indexerNamespace map "

However it's not a big deal...\n\n\nPersonally instead of build the query from strings, I think it would be more elegant to:\n\n\tStore all dates (even persisted one) as Dates in the indexerNamespace map\n\tWhen creating the delta query, create a PreparedStatement, replacing the variables by real JDBC parameters so that delta query would be:\n\nSELECT bje.job_execution_id as JOB_EXECUTION_ID\nFROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION bje\nWHERE last_updated > ?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\tInject the parameters directly as Date instead of replacing the ${xxx} by strings\n\tThe JDBC parameters position could be a matter and then Spring has a solution for that -> NamedParameterJdbcTemplate\n\n "
