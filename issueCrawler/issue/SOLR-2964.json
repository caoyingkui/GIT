    "description": "Currently the disjunction between distributed and non-distributed methods in the SearchComponent makes it confusing for people to write SearchComponents.  We should explore just using the distributed approaches and dropping prepare/process.  Then, when there is only one node, it can effectively just use a loopback mechanism (no network traffic required).\n\nWe should also better document what the stages are.",
