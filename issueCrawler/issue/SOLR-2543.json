I know SOLR-2524 needs it, but that random test is failing, and we don't know if it's a bug in the test or a bug in this backport?  Maybe there's a simple 3.x test we can cutover to the random infra to try to debug it? "

SOLR-2552 should also fix this...\n\n\n\nFinally, it turns out the TestIndexSearcher bug had already been fixed\non trunk... please backport fixes from trunk to 3.x when possible,\nespecially test and test infra fixes!
