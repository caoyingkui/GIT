    "description": "This is definitely not the prettiest way to do things, but it is by far the simplest. In April, 2006, Erik Hatcher added a fix to Solr that properly escaped all XML attributes in the response. However, we have a specific instance where we do not want to escape the XML. We are injecting some additional elements into the XML. The escaping function, however, escapes these XML elements. So, I would like to add an additional XMLWriter.writeResponse function that has a boolean flag to turn off the escaping function. I will still keep the current signature, so nothing should break.",
