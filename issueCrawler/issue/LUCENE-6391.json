    "description": "Fix SpanScorer to use any two-phase iterator support of the underlying Spans. This means e.g. a spans in a booleanquery, or a spans with a filter can be faster.\n\nIn order to do this, we have to clean up this class a little bit:\n\n\tforward most methods directly to the underlying spans.\n\tensure positions are only iterated at most once.",
