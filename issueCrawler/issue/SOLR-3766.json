I would not want to see such tests excluded from failing the build on all jenkins/automated tests.  This goes back to Mark's request for a dont-run-on-our-freebsd annotation (which makes more sense now that we have other jenkins servers running).\n\tSome tests may only be unstable for certain JVMs\n\n\n\nThere should also be consensus before a test gets thrown into a place where people won't notice (or care about) it's failure.  Without that, we'd need to come to consensus on an unambiguous policy about when a test may be marked such that it will no longer fail builds.\n\nMaybe an easier solution would still be to send mail on failure, and then people who were not interested could exclude it in a mail filter.

            "content": "These tests should not be excluded from the normal non-jenkins command line \"ant test\"\n\nI think the point is to exclude known flaky tests from \"ant test\" runs so that people running precommit tests or something don't have to re-run their tests because a known offender failed. One can enable them on the build server (that's why I created a separate plan) where time is of no crucial importance and which can either not send e-mails or send them tagged so that people can ignore them (as I'm sure most of us already do, unfortunately).\n\nAnyway, I give up on trying to improve this situation. There is a non-intersecting set of strongly defended positions and I don't see a solution for this. "

But those annotations that I added have been removed, the tests still fail and I'm just tired of arguing about the whole subject. I'll probably do what Uwe said \u2013 just not run Solr tests at all.
