One Solr instance can handle any number of indexes, and running multiple instances will waste resources like memory, as well as make it necessary to be aware of the port number instead of simply letting all Solr instances run on the same port.\n\nIf you're running the cloud example, the different logs from each node are already in separate directories.

In the sh version if you disable GC_LOG_OPTS the file is not created. It's a small inconsistency. ",
