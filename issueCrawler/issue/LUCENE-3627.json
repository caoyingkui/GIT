    "description": "FSDirectory.createOutput(..) uses a RandomAccessFile to do its work.  On my system the default FSDirectory.open(..) creates an NIOFSDirectory.  If createOutput is called on a segments_* file and a crash occurs between RandomAccessFile creation (file system shows a segments_* file exists but has zero bytes) but before any bytes are written to the file, subsequent IndexWriters cannot proceed.  The difficulty is that it does not know how to clear the empty segments_* file.  None of the file deletions will happen on such a segment file because the opening bytes cannot not be read to determine format and version.\n\nAn initial proposed patch file is attached below.",

First, when writing the segments file,\nI moved the createOutput in SegmentInfos.java inside the try/finally\nthat deletes the file if an exception occurs.  This way we shouldn't\ncreate 0-byte segments_N anymore.\n\nSecond, in IndexFileDeleter I ignore a given segments_N if it's 0\nbytes; I don't delete the file at that point because IFD's normal\nref-counting will eventually remove it.

At that point you'd hit\nthis bug when you next tried to open an IndexWriter on the index.\n\nThe more common failure would be if the segments_N fails to write (0\nbyte file) and then when you close the IW it also fails, ie, because\nsomething suddenly is wrong w/ your IO system.  In this case your\n\"latest\" segments_N is unreadable, and Lucene handles that fine (falls\nback to segments_(N-1), which should be ok because it was fsync'd). ",
