    "description": "Hi,\nusing the edismax query parser, a query containing only * (q=********) can crash the Solr node because of an out of memory error.\nIncreasing the number of * increases the memory consumption until the OOM error (with 4888 *).\n\nThe file 'select_resp.json' describes the query request (faceting is active).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards.",
