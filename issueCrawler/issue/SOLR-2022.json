    "description": "As originally reported in this thread...\n\nhttp://search.lucidimagination.com/search/document/9c09498631b7afbb/problems_running_on_tomcat\n\nTomcat 7 has made changes in how URLs are resolved that result in the requests with paths that end in a \"/\" character being given to the SolrDispatchFilter  with \"index.jsp\" appended to them.  This results in SolrDispatchFilter being unable to correctly identify some situations when a request should be processed by a request handler based on the name registered (ie: \"/update/csv/\" is seen as \"update/csv/index.jsp\" so as a result the handler registered to \"/update/csv/ is not consulted).  The problem manifests as a generic 404 (because the request is propagated to the underlying JspServlet which can not find these paths and jsps in the war)\n\nThis is most notable in a basic solr install when clicking some URLs that are linked to from the main admin page (see comments below) but this problem can also affect any situation where a client is attempting to access a request handler (or \"/select/\") using a path ending in \"/\".  The workaround is to remove hte trailing \"/\" character",

There may be ways we can work around this behavior a little better \u2013 depending on what response we get in bug#50161 we might consider changes to our web.xml to override the default \"welcome-file\" behavior, or changing the way SolrDispatchFilter attempts to parse the URL path.
