So don't change that condition! Because we are now on minimum Java 8, you can set build.compiler always to javac1.7 as workaround:\n\n\n  <!-- workaround for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53347 -->\n  <condition property=\"build.compiler\" value=\"javac1.7\">\n    <or>\n      <antversion exactly=\"1.8.3\" />\n      <antversion exactly=\"1.8.4\" />\n    </or>\n  </condition>\n\n\n\nAlso some conditions/fails are commented out (also in root build.xml regarding smoke tester).
