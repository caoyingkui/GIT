    "description": "After shard splitting completes and the new sub-shards become active the original (parent) shards is switched to inactive state. Since 7.4 Solr runs a scheduled trigger that uses InactiveShardPlanAction to eventually remove inactive shards when their TTL expires (2 days by default).\n\nHowever, in the meantime even though the shard is inactive all cores that belong to this shard are still running, and should a node restart these cores would be loaded again too.\n\nLarge scale simulated tests show that in case of a constantly growing index after a while most of the cluster resources are consumed by cores that belong to inactive shards.\n\nWe should change this so that when the switch-over to the new sub-shards is complete the cores belonging to the inactive parent shard should be unloaded and not loaded again - at the very least it should be made into an option that is true by default.",
