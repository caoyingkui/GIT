            "content": "One issue here is the different purposes for lucene and solr function queries.\nSolr's function queries have always evolved at a rapid pace (and are continuing to evolve) to support higher level features and interfaces in Solr.  They are able to evolve rapidly because they are seen more as an implementation detail rather than interface classes, and I'd hate to lose that.  So if we do try to make Solr's function queries more accessible to lucene users (again), it should be as a Solr module.  As we can see from history and usage, function queries are critically important to Solr, but are obviously not to Lucene. ",

I don't think that moving stuff to modules changes anything how we develop software. Modularization, decoupling, interfaces etc. you know how to work with those ey? so hey what is really the point here, this modularization is a key point of merging development with lucene and everytime somebody proposes something like this you fear that that monolithic thing under /solr could become more modular and decoupled. I don't know why this is the case but we should and will move on with modularization. Folks will use it once its there, thats for sure. Same is true for faceting, replication, queryparsers, functionparser... those are on the list! ",

If you need to change something or make additions to such an interface / abstract class or whatever you should be able to do this.

I start getting the impression that this anti-modularization thing has nothing todo with code and development.. Lots of software has been evolving even with bwcompat etc. but hey this is not core - deprecation and changes should not be super hard to do and we always decided case by case. if it was easy / doable with bw compat we did it - if not we broke it so what it the big deal again?

There is a concern - currently the Solr function queries are part of Solr - java code in Solr is changed on a whim. In Lucene, the bar is higher - java code is generally considered an impl detail in Solr, unless it's a plugin api. This has been an attractive quality in the past. Moving it to Lucene changes it to more of a supported API. Valid point if you ask me.\n\n3. A response was made about marking it experimental.\n\n4. A response was made about perhaps internal.\n\nThe rest does not add much. We have not voted on this issue - we voted on broad topics - to be sorted out as we go.

If solr needs some feature in FuncQuery & friends we are going to add it. If we can fix it without breaking BWCompat we should do it - if not we discuss case by case! I have actually written some FuncQuery related code for customers and they would not be happy if we break bwcompat codewise (I exclude package naming here) - just saying that keeping it internal so that we can hack it as we like is not an option anyway!!\n\njust my $0.05\n\nsimon ",

In other words,  FQs are already more interface than implementation.\n\tI've always been stumped as to why more Lucene users don't use them and instead re-invent the wheel.  The fact that it has taken this long frankly mystifies me\n\tAs a corollary of that, more light on them will make them better, improve performance, etc.\n\tI agree with most here that the ability to do this kind of thing is exactly why we merged.\n\n\n\nHmm I don't really understand that part either. You're concerned that you'll lose the freedom to add functionality that'd benefit Solr only?\n\nI don't think that is the concern.  I think the concern is that if one only has to worry about implementation details and not about backwards compat, public API, etc. then it is a lot easier to innovate.  It's the equivalent of refactoring IndexWriter public methods versus the underlying DocumentsWriter.   Remember, in Solr, 99% of the public API is in the Request parameters, not in Java interface.  As long as we maintain BWC for the Request interface (i.e. &start=0&rows=10&q=foo), we are more or less free to do what we want in the implementation layer.  \n\nIn the end, I'm +1 on moving it, but with the distinction that changes in modules need to account for Solr as well as Lucene.

The patch applies cleanly for me (after running the svn\ncommands) and everything compiles.\n\nI think the patch is a great start, ie, we will need the low level\ninfra used by FQs in the module.\n\nMutableValue & MutableFloatValue are used in the FunctionQuery code so I've pulled them into the module too. Should all the other Mutable*Value classes come too? Should they go into some other module?\n\nI think we should move Mutable* over?  Grouping module will need all\nof these, I think?  (Ie if we want to allow users to group by\narbitrary typed field).\n\nWhat to return in ValueSource#getSortField which currently returns a SortField which implements SolrSortField. This is currently commented out so we can determine what best to do. Having this commented out breaks the Solr tests.\n\nHmm good question.  This looks to be related to sorting by FQ\n(SOLR-1297) because some FQs need to be weighted.  Not sure what to do\nhere yet... which FQs in particular require this?\n\nMany of the ValueSources and DocValues in Solr could be moved to the module, but not all of them. Some have dependencies on Solr dependencies / Solr core code.\n\nI think apply 90/10 rule here?  Start with the easy-to-move queries?\nWe don't need initial go to be perfect... progress not perfection.\n\nLucene core's FunctionQuery stuff needs to be removed.\n\nDo you have a sense of whether Solr's FQs are a superset of Lucene's?\nIe, is there anything Lucene's FQs can do that Solr's can't?\n\nProbably, as a separate issue, we should also move contrib/queries ->\nmodules/queries.  And I think the cool nested queries (LUCENE-2454)\nwould also go into this module... ",
