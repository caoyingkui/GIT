    "description": "The function normalize(char s[], int len), in the package org.apache.lucene.analysis.ar.ArabicNormalizer, makes an incorrect  character folding in Arabic. The incorrect folding affects the letters Teh Marbuta (U+0629) and Heh (U+0647) at the end of a word (according to the study of El-Sherbiny et al., 2010, page 5).\n\nTo fix this bug the solution is inserting an if clause, where the folding is made only an if the Teh Marbuta is not at the end of the word. Suggestion for the new case code is following:\n\ncase TEH_MARBUTA:\n  if (i < (len-1))\n    s [ i ] = HEH;\n  break;\n\nReferences:\nEl-Sherbiny, A., Farah, M., Oueichek, I., Al-Zoman, A.
