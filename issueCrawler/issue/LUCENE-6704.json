    "description": "After investigating LUCENE-6685 the performance issues and improvements related to GeoPointInBBox/Distance queries could be categorized into two separate issues:\n\n1. OOME caused by an unnecessary number of ranges computed for Point Distance Queries (bug in the GeoPointTermEnum base class where the bounding box was used for intersections instead of the point radius)\n2. API improvements providing configurable detail parameters.\n\nThis issue addresses 1.  LUCENE-6685 will further investigate the need for 2 (after working 1 and correcting for unnecessary range detail, it looks like 2 may not be needed)",

            "content": "Patch attached with the following enhancements:\n\n1. Leaves DETAIL_LEVEL fixed at 16 w/ GeoPointField.PRECISION_STEP fixed at 6.\n2. Updates relation logic to relate candidate cells to the appropriate shape.\n3. Changes mortonEncoding logic to use full 32 bits per lat/lon (full 64 bit long precision). This fixes an accuracy bug where the max lon/lat correctly decodes to 180,90 (instead of 179.999999, 89.999999).\n\nNote that this patch will break the current patch for LUCENE-6647. Updated patch for that coming next. "

But the patch seems to do much more (good things!).\n\nCan you add a dedicated standalone test that today hits OOME and then with this patch doesn't?  To confirm the patch is fixing OOMEs in both GeoPointInBBoxQuery and GeoPointDistanceQuery...\n\nWhy is GeoPointDistanceQuery not final anymore?  Seems like nothing wants to extend it...\n\nI like the added javadocs, and BigInteger usage is always fun  "

I'll isolate one of the OOME failures from testRandom() so before/after patch validation can be run.\n\nWhy is GeoPointDistanceQuery not final anymore? Seems like nothing wants to extend it...\n\nThat was a change intended for a new issue. I've added a GeoPointDistanceRangeQuery that extends GeoPointDistanceQuery. I'll remove it from this patch and apply it in a new issue. Sorry for that confusion  "
