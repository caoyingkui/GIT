    "description": "While working on SOLR-10156 I experimented with different scoring formula's for scoring terms. I found that the scoring formula used by the scoreNodes functions overweights the raw term counts. Through experimentation I found a formula that does not overweight the raw term counts and provides a much better significance score. This ticket applies the new formula.",
