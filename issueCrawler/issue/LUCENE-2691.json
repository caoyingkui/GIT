Why would a Reader do write functionality?  \n\nif you got a reader from IW, it reopens by asking said IW for the segments.\n\nYep, and if you (re)open a Reader with an IW you get a Reader based on those segments.\n\nAdding more ways to do the same thing in this case just seems to complicate the API. \n\nWe didn't add any more ways to do this.
