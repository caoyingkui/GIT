Creates conf directories under work directory before test runs, and suppresses a warning.\n\nThe console noise that remains is some XML parsing failure, which may or may not be meaningful (I don't know) \u2014 at least now it is visible. \n\nThis patch is against branch_3x as of just now.

I modified it, to just specify the absolute path to these directories.\n\nthis way we don't have to make any useless directories underneath the CWD.\n\nSeparately, as far as the exceptions, this is in the test TestErrorHandling, its 'expected exceptions'. I tried to modify this test to use the 'expected exception' logic in SolrTestCaseJ4, etc, but I could not make it work. \n\nI think this is because DIH throws DataImportHandlerExceptions (extends RuntimeException) instead of ones that extend SolrException?

This way the exception-ignoring mechanism gets a say in matters. Test output is nice and clean now. I addressed only those logger calls that were emitting exceptions in unit test runs.\n\nNote: this does not require DataImportHandlerException to extend SolrException, so the earlier SOLR-2367-extend-SolrException.patch is not needed.
