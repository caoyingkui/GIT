    "description": "Post from Antony Bowesman on java-user:\n\n\n\nI just noticed that although the Javadocs for Lucene 2.2 state that the dates \nfor DateTools use UTC as a timezone, they are actually using GMT.\n\nShould either the Javadocs be corrected or the code corrected to use UTC instead.\n\n\n\nI'm attaching a patch that changes the javadoc and will commit it, unless someone knows a reason the javadoc is correct and the code should be changed to UTC. To my understanding, there's no significant difference between UTC and GMT.",
