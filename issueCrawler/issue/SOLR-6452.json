Why missing facet counters cant work on StatsValues directly without intermediate maps.

Does it require new issue or reopen SOLR-6452?\n\nImplementation of this issue can be improved in few cases:\n1. Accumulate methods should not return stats specific numbers (it is generic). Attached solution with container class. Also made them private scoped.\nReturning just missing fields from accumulate methods does not allow you to extend it with additional counts field, therefore i propose to leave void.\n\n2. Reduced visibility of fields in FieldFacetStats.\nCreated getter to expose FieldFacetStats.facetStatsValues.\n\n3. Methods FieldFacetStats#accumulateMissing and FieldFacetStats#accumulateTermNum does not throw any IO exception\n\n4. We don't need intermediate maps to accumulate missing counts. Changed org.apache.solr.handler.component.FieldFacetStats#facetMissingNum \nto work directly on StatsValues structure and removed  org.apache.solr.handler.component.FieldFacetStats#accumulateMissing. \nWe don't need to have it in 2 phases.
