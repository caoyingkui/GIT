    "description": "Now that the QueryWeight class has been removed, the public QueryWeight createQueryWeight() method on Query was also removed\n\ni have cases where i want to create a weight for a sub query (outside of the org.apache.lucene.search package) and i don't want the weight normalized (think BooleanQuery outside of the o.a.l.search package)\n\nin order to do this, i have to create a static Utils class inside o.a.l.search, pass in the Query and searcher, and have the static method call the protected createWeight method\nthis should not be necessary\n\nThis could be fixed in one of 2 ways:\n1. make createWeight() public on Query (breaks back compat)\n2. add the following method:\n\npublic Weight createQueryWeight(Searcher searcher) throws IOException {\n  return createWeight(searcher);\n}\n\n\n\ncreateWeight(Searcher) should then be deprectated in favor of the publicly accessible method",
