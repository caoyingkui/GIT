            "content": "PKIAuthenticationPlugin doesn't report errors in case the key provided is invalid and instead just returns garbage. This causes the authorization to break as well.\n\nOriginal text:\n\nHere are the list of steps that you'd need to run to see that things are fine for you without the read permission:\n\n\tUntar and setup Solr, don't start it yet\n\tStart clean zookeeper\n\tPut the security.json in zk, without anything other than a security-edit permission. Find the content of the file below. Upload it using your own zk client or through the solr script:\n> solr-5.3.1/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh -zkhost localhost:2181 -cmd putfile /security.json ~/security.json\n\n\n\nsecurity.json:\n{\"authentication\":{\"class\":\"solr.BasicAuthPlugin\",\"credentials\":{\"solr\":\"IV0EHq1OnNrj6gvRCwvFwTrZ1+z1oBbnQdiVC3otuq0= Ndd7LKvVBAaZIF0QAVi1ekCfAJXr1GGfLtRUXhgrF8c=\"}},\"authorization\":{\"class\":\"solr.RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin\",\"user-role\":\n{\"solr\":[\"admin\"]}\n,\"permissions\":[\n{\"name\":\"security-edit\",\"role\":\"admin\"}\n]}}\n\n\n\tStart solr:\n> solr-5.3.1/bin/solr start -e cloud -z localhost:2181\n\n\n\nYou would need to key in a few things e.g. #nodes and ports, leave them at the default values of 2 nodes and 8983/7574, unless you want to run Solr on a different port. Then let it create a default collection to just make sure that everything works fine.\n\n\n\tAdd the collection-admin-edit command:\n> curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authorization -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{\"set-permission\" : {\"name\":\"collection-admin-edit\", \"role\":\"admin\"}}'\n\n\n\nAt this point, everything should be working fine. Restarting the nodes  should also work fine. You can try 2 things at this point:\n1. Create a new collection with 1 shard and 1 replica and then try adding a replica, here's how:\n> curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=testcollection&collection.configName=gettingstarted&numShards=1\n\n> curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=ADDREPLICA&collection=testcollection&shard=shard1\n\nThis should work fine.\n\n2. After this, try restarting the solr cluster. Here's how you can do so, assuming you didn't change any of the defaults and you are running zk on localhost:2181. If not, just change those values below:\n> bin/solr stop -all\n\nAfter this, check that Solr was actually stopped. I'd also suggest you tail the logs on both nodes when they are coming up to see any errors, if any. The logs would be here: example/cloud/node1/logs/solr.log and example/cloud/node2/logs/solr.log\n\n> bin/solr start -c -p 8983 -s \"example/cloud/node1/solr\" -z localhost:2181\n> bin/solr start -c -p 7574 -s \"example/cloud/node2/solr\" -z localhost:2181\n\nIf you get to this checkpoint fine, try adding a read permission.\nAdd a permission:\n> curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authorization -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{\"set-permission\" : {\"name\":\"read\", \"role\":\"read\"}}'\n\nAdd a user:\n> curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authentication -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{\"set-user\" : {\"solrread\":\"solrRocks\"}}'\n\nAssign a role to the user:\n>curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authorization -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{\"set-user-role\" : {\"solrread\":[\"read\"]}}'\n\nAfter this, you should start having issues with ADDREPLICA.\nAlso, as you would at this point have a collection with a shard that has a replication factor > 1 (remember the ADDREPLICA we did earlier), you would have issues when you restart the cluster again using the steps I mentioned above.

I've also made a few things final in this patch where I thought it made sense.\nThe rest looks good to me.\n\nI tested this out with:\n\n\tStart a 2 node cluster with external zk and security.json in place\n\tTry creating a collection and adding a replica - positive\n\tAdd collection-admin-edit rule and make sure that credentials are required - positive\n\tRestart one of the nodes and see there are no errors - positive\n\tAdd read user and permission, then create a collection - positive\n\tAdd a replica on the new collection - positive\n\tRestart one of the nodes and make sure there are no errors and the replicas are healthy once the node is up - positive\n\n\n\nIt'd be good to add a test here so that we don't regress. It could be a PKI test or a Chaos monkey test perhaps, but then we'll need to figure a way to get Chaos monkey to work with MiniSolrCloudCluster so we could upload the security conf etc. \nFor now, I think we should commit this as I'm not sure how long would the test itself take considering we're close to cutting the 5.4 branch and this is a blocker.
