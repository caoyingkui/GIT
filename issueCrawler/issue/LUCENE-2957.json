Xerces 2.11 needs it, because it ships with Java 6's JAXP release (containing STAX & Co. not available in Java 5). ",

For Solr 3.1, we will not be upgrading the Carrot2 library, since it's so close to the release, so it would not help for the release.\n\nBut for Solr 3.2, which will very likely be the next release, and which will still require Java 1.5, a Mavenized (i.e. published in a Maven repository) Java 1.5 version of Carrot2 3.4.3 would definitely be useful.\n\nA Mavenized Java 1.5-compiled 3.4.2 version would be useful for the 3.1 release, but it's understandable if you don't want to do this work for an older version.
