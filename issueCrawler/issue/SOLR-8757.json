    "description": "I have created a Solr CoreAdminHandler extension with the goal to swap two cores and remove the old one.\n\nMy code looks like this:\n\nSolrCore core = coreContainer.create(\"newcore\", coreProps)\ncoreContainer.swap(\"newcore\", \"livecore\")\n// the old livecore is now newcore, so unload it and remove all the related dirs\ncoreContainer.unload(\"newcore\", true, true, true)\n\nAfter the last statement get executed the Solr log starts printing the following messages forever\n\n61424 INFO (pool-1-thread-1) [ x:newcore] o.a.s.c.SolrCore Core newcore is not yet closed, waiting 100 ms before checking again.\n\nI tried to call the close() method on the SolrCore instance before and after the unload but the result is the same.",

The CoreAdmin can already do it without custom code.\n\nJust ask CoreAdmin to swap the two cores, then unload the \"old\" one.\n\nI personally just keep two cores for every index \u2013 a build core and a live core.  I swap them as needed with the HTTP API, and never unload either one.  The directory names for these cores do not include \"live\" or \"build\" ... for the cores named s0build and s0live, the directories are s0_0 and s0_1. ",
