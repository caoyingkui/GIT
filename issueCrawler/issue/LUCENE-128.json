One is\n\"Enumerations\", which required to add the new keyword enum.\n\nI just made a grep (grep -lrw) over some sources and found some Apache projects\nusing enum as a word.\n\nTo be compliant with the new specification, please check that enum is not used\nas a variable, field or method name.\n\nRegards,\nRobert",
