    "description": "As part of SOLR-9513 we added a Solr authentication plugin which uses Hadoop security framework. The HTTP client interface provided by Hadoop framework does not send the authentication information preemptively. Instead it sends an OPTIONS request first. If the server responds with 401 error, it resends the request with the proper authentication information. This jira is to handle the OPTIONS request as part of the Solr authentication plugin for Hadoop.",
