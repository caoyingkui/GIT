The first thing that comes to mind with a regular expression configuration in Solr is the highlighting component and indeed it uses \"regex\", so it's best to stick to that.\n\nhave expplicit strings like regex.flag=case_sensitive&regex.flag=multiline \nYeah... I had this feeling as well, but I thought it might be too many extra parameters just for the regular expression support. If you think that's best I can add it.\n\nI'll make the changes tonight and submit a new patch. "
