The only way to get around this is to go on to the host and manually remove the orphaned directories.",

I tried to create a new collection named \"foo\" that had a problem in the solrconfig.xml, which failed but still left cruft in the solr home (e.g. foo_shard1_replica1). Next, I fixed the config problem and re-created collection \"foo\", which worked. I still don't think a create should leave around cruft if it fails but it seems that is now benign cruft. ",
