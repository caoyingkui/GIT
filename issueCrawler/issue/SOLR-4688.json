            "content": "CoreContainerCoreInitFailuresTest and CoreAdminHandlerTest  should be a good inspiration for what we want to sanity check about lazy loaded cores.\n\na logic flow path i wonder about specifically...\n\n1) does attempting to lazy load a core that has an init failure (ie: bad config) result in a 500 error being returned and does the init failure get recorded so that it is included in core admin STATUS requests?\n2) does subsequently fixing the problem (ie: fix the bad config) cause future core admin STATUS requests to no longer report that previous init failure?
