    "description": "If I execute a query in the Solr Admin Query UI, the default XML \"writer\" displays only the raw text of the Solr response XML element values, but none of the XML syntax itself, rendering the response display on the Query page almost completely useless. JSON, Ruby, et al display very reasonably formatted output, but XML does not.\n\nYou can click on the icon next to the generated query URL to display the response in a browser tab of its own and then it does display the XML very reasonably, but the framed display on the query page is simply not readable.\n\nMy recollection is that the old UI had this same problem.",

Is there maybe some add-on that might be needed? Or maybe some option(s) that need to be enabled or disabled?\n\nI would add that when I do display the XML by clicking on the URL icon, Chrome does also inform me that \"This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.\" It still formats the XML properly though. I get the same exact message in Firefox if I click on the URL icon.\n\nSomebody must have some clue as to while this specific feature of the Solr UI would behave differently on my system. My current suspicion is that the Solr UI is dependent on some add-on that your average Solr committer happens to have also installed.\n "

I vote for Ruby/indented. Not a default return type at the backend, just start the UI page with those options pre-selected. "
