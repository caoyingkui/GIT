    "description": "While digging through SOLR-9363, I realized that the reason the failures reproduced when running the entire -Dtestcase but not the individual -Dtests.method was because TestInjection was behaving differently in those cases.\n\nThis is because TestInjection uses a static Random instance \u2013 allthough it is initialized based on the tests.seed sysprop to try to be reproducible, it's behavior still very much depends on how many testcases are run in that slave JVM, and/or how many test methods are run.",
