    "description": "When sending commands in the Java binary format to the BinaryUpdateRequestHandler it does not process them in the order received.  It processes all add/updates then delete by id then delete by query regardless of what is sent.  See SOLR-1162 for related issue and patch that covers both issues (they are intertwined since some classes are shared on both sides of the wire)\n\nI wanted a separate issue covering this so that it is seen from the server viewpoint and not just as a client API issue as other clients writing the binary form would be unable to maintain order of commands as well.",
