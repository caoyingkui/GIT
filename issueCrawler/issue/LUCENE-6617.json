    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-6199, pulling out just the FST RAM reduction changes.\n\nThe FST data structure tries to be a RAM efficient representation of a sorted map, but there are a few things I think we can do to trim it even more:\n\n\n\tDon't store arc and node count: this is available from the Builder if you really want to do something with it.\n\n\n\n\n\tDon't use the \"paged\" byte store unless the FST is huge; just use a single byte[]\n\n\n\n\n\tSome members like lastFrozenNode, reusedBytesPerArc, allowArrayArcs are only used during building, so we should move them to the Builder\n\n\n\n\n\tWe don't need to cache NO_OUTPUT: we can ask the Outputs impl for it",

Seems like pennies to me compared to what the actual data does?\n\nYou're right, it's just a constant byte reduction on the starting size of an FST, but for tiny FSTs, if you have many of them, this can add up.\n\nFST aims to be a very memory efficient data structure so I don't think we should waste bytes if we don't need to ...
