    "description": "Right now, 'ant compile' at the top level compiles Lucene core, all non-test Solr sources, and all Lucene modules on which Solr depends.  lucene/codecs/, e.g., doesn't get compiled, because 'ant compile' is an alias for 'ant compile-core' under lucene/.\n\nSimilarly for 'ant jar' (except there is no top-level target for this right now), with some problems under solr/.\n\nThere is no top-level 'ant compile-test'.\n\nAll these targets should recurse at all levels.\n\nUnder lucene/ and solr/, 'ant jar-core' and 'ant compile-core' should be aliased to running the operation under core/.",

            "content": "+1, man is this confusing.\n\nIt should be dead simple to compile all the code and make jars for lucene. compile in /lucene/ should NOT be a alias for compile-core (imo), instead it should recurse across all modules. Same with jar (not an alias for jar-core).\n\nSeparately the confusion a user has when they run 'ant -p' (e.g. from lucene): there is a huge list of targets but which one should i use to just compile stuff or make jars? some of these should probably be hidden (separate issue: LUCENE-4416). But we can fix this separately of course! ",

I intentionally left it out - it seems pretty clear to me that test-framework belongs in the same bucket as */src/test/**, which gets compiled via 'ant compile-test'.  (I should go test that assumption  ).\n\nthe 'jar' target seems more clear that everything is jar'ed (including test-framework)\n\nYeah, test-framework jar is externally consumable, so excluding it from 'ant jar' seemed wrong.

But there is no top-level 'ant compile-test'.  I'll add it.\n\nOK: in any case I just wanted to make sure it was intentional. Maybe just add a comment?\n\nGood idea, I'll do that. ",
