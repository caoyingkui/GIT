    "description": "I have a dih config with a SqlEntityProcessor that retrives a table. I then have a sub-entity with the XPathEntityProcessor type, this takes a value from the table as input to parse through an xml doc. \nI find that the first document is created correctly, but then the xpathReader of the XPathEntityProcessor does not reinitialize for the following documents so the initial documents input is used. \n\n\n<dataSource name=\"hivseqdb\" driver=\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\"\n\t   url=\"l\"\n           user=\"hivseqdb\" password=\"hivseqdb\" batchSize=\"1\"/>\n           \n    <dataSource name=\"xmlFile\" type=\"FileDataSource\" />\n    \n\t<document><entity name=\"Sequence\" dataSource=\"hivseqdb\" pk=\"se_id\" query=\"SELECT * FROM hivseqdb.sequenceentry where se_id != '1'\">\n\t\t\t\n            <entity name=\"FMA_Tissue_Hierarchy\" \n            \t\tdataSource=\"xmlFile\"\n            \t\tpk=\"fma-id\"\n            \t\tforEach=\"/tissue-samples\" \n            \t\tprocessor=\"XPathEntityProcessor\" \n            \t\turl=\"/opt/hivseqdb/solr/conf/sub_ontology_translated.xml\" \n            \t\tstream=\"true\">\n                <field column=\"tissue-antology-parent-path\" xpath=\"/tissue-samples/tissue[@fma-id='${Sequence.sampleTissueCode}']/parent-path\"/>\n            </entity>\n\n\nDocBuilder dose call init on the XPathEntityProcessor but there is a conditional in the init method to check if the xpathReader is null:\n\n  public void init(Context context) {\n    super.init(context);\n    if (xpathReader == null)\n      initXpathReader();\n    pk = context.getEntityAttribute(\"pk\");\n    dataSource = context.getDataSource();\n    rowIterator = null;\n\n  }\n\n\nSo the xPathReader is used again and again. Is there away to reinitialize the xPathReader for every document? Or what is the specific design reason for preserving it?",

If the xpath has a variable such as \n\n \nxpath=\"/tissue-samples/tissue[@fma-id='${Sequence.sampleTissueCode}']/parent-path\" \n\n\nthen it needs to be recreated before starting with each XML file.\n\n Solutions:\n\n\n\tmake XPathRecordReader aware of the templates and recompute them before each XML\n\tIf templates are present in  xpath or forEach , discard the XPathRecordReader instance before every XML\n\n\n\nFor sake of simplicity I would recommend #2 "
