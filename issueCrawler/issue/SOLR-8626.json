The issue existed - and has been fixed - in both the flat graph view and the radial view. Additionally, when one was in the radial view and clicked on the link for a node, it would switch back to flat graph view when navigating to the other node, so the patch also improves the link in the radial view so that it preserves the user's current view type on the URL when navigating between nodes.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/treygrainger/lucene-solr SOLR-8626\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/23.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #23\n\n\ncommit dc4a490eb4edf49972849eb42b604fe490a88d75\nAuthor: Trey Grainger <code@treygrainger.com>\nDate:   2016-03-20T04:21:16Z\n\n    SOLR-8626: Fix urls for nodes in cloud graph view\n\n ",
