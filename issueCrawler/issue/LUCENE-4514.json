    "description": "Today Scorer.freq() is somewhat useless: because in general it returns the number of matches, but other times it returns a strange floating point value (essentially an intermediate score).\n\nI think it should just return the number of matches in the document. This makes it well-defined and useful to consumers (e.g. if they are going to iterate over the positions or whatever in the future).\n\n\n   /** Returns number of matches for the current document.\n-   *  This returns a float (not int) because\n-   *  SloppyPhraseScorer discounts its freq according to how\n-   *  \"sloppy\" the match was.\n    *\n    * @lucene.experimental */\n-  public abstract float freq() throws IOException;\n+  public abstract int freq() throws IOException;",
