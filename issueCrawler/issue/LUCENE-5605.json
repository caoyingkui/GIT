    "description": "Currently in our Field API we use the FieldType class that contains the information about data type and stuff like the numeric precisionStep.\n\nUnfortunately in NumericRangeQuery/NumericRangeFilter, we still require the precisionStep given in the query. For the user this is hard to understand, leading to problems like passing a different precisionStep than the one which was used for indexing. If we change that parameter in NRQ/NRF to take FieldType, we can extract the precStep as an implementation detail. We just have to check that the field type is a numeric one and is indexed. The user cannot do anything wrong anymore, unless he creates a new, incompatible field type.",
