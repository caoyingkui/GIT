But it doesn't, and causes NPE with CloudDescriptor.getNumShards() when running custom code.\n\nI can recreate the core correctly via property.name=value but this is not obvious in the documentation.\n\nThis is core.properties before unloading:\n\n#Written by CorePropertiesLocator\n#Fri Apr 01 13:07:11 UTC 2016\nnumShards=2\ncollection.configName=logs\nname=logs_shard1_replica1\nshard=shard1\ncollection=logs\ncoreNodeName=core_node4\n\n\n\nThis is after unloading and recreating:\n\n\n#Written by CorePropertiesLocator\n#Mon Apr 04 15:42:59 UTC 2016\nname=logs_shard1_replica1\nshard=shard1\ncollection=logs\ncoreNodeName=core_node4",
