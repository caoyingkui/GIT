            "content": "The error message in the patch says \"Could not find necessary SLF4j logging jars. If using Jetty, the SLF4j logging jars need to go in the jetty lib/ext directory. For other containers, the corresponding directory should be used.\"\n\nWhen I read this, I thought: we should direct people to a fuller discussion of what \"SLF4j logging jars\" refers to, but http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrLogging is not it - it has apparently not been updated since the logging jars were removed from the war.\n\nThe CHANGES.txt entry is similarly devoid of specifics:\n\n\n\n\tSlf4j/logging jars are no longer included in the Solr webapp. All logging\n  jars are now in example/lib/ext. Changing logging impls is now as easy as \n  updating the jars in this folder with those necessary for the logging impl \n  you would like. If you are using another webapp container, these jars will \n  need to go in the corresponding location for that container. \n  In conjunction, the dist-excl-slf4j and dist-war-excl-slf4 build targets \n  have been removed since they are redundent.  See the Slf4j documentation, \n  SOLR-3706, and SOLR-4651 for more details.\n\n\n\nShouldn't we provide specifics here, somehow?  I don't think the error message in the patch will reduce mailing list traffic at all - the questions will just be \"what slf4j jars do I need now?\" instead of \"why I am I getting a class not found exception?\"  "
