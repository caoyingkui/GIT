Also switches lock strategy to \"artifact-lock-nio\", as recommended on a comment on IVY-1489.\n\nI'm not sure whether we have a minimum version check for ivy, or whether we are using any features that require a minimum version check.\n\nWe do have a check for disallowed ivy versions, in ivy-availability-check; I updated the regex to also disallow 2.3.X.  \"artifact-lock-nio\" is new in 2.4.0, so 2.3.X will have to be disallowed.\n\nWith this patch I interrupted ant resolve with ctrl-c a couple times, and each following invocation succeeded, so I think it's an improvement over 2.3.0.\n\nIf there are no objections, I'll commit tomorrow.
