            "content": "Thorny issue.  Geo3dShape (in Lucene spatial) implements Shape (a Spatial4j interface), and I've always thought it ideally would exist and be provided by Spatial4j, and thus be tested there too.  This is the only bit of integration there right now.  It's been on my todo list.  I think I vote to mark these tests as @Ignore for now, but Geo3dRptTest can stay as it's not impacted and fundamentally is a Lucene (spatial) thing.  Feel free to do so with a comment, obviously. "
