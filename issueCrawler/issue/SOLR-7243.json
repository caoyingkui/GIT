    "description": "We found this problem while upgrading Solr from 4.4 to 4.10.3. Our integration test is similar to this Solr unit test,\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/core/src/test/org/apache/solr/schema/TestCloudSchemaless.java\n\nSpecifically we test if the Solr server returns BAD_REQUEST when provided with incorrect input.The only difference is that it uses CloudSolrServer instead of HttpSolrServer. The CloudSolrServer always returns SERVER_ERROR error code. Please take a look\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/817303840fce547a1557e330e93e5a8ac0618f34/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/impl/CloudSolrServer.java#L359\n\nI think we can improve the error handling by checking if the first exception in the list is of type SolrException and if that is the case return the error code associated with that exception. If the first exception is not of type SolrException, then we can return SERVER_ERROR code.",

            "content": "Shawn Heisey A new patch against the trunk. \n\nImproved the error handling such that\n1. error code corresponding to first exception is used (if possible) while throwing the RouteException.\n2. Ensure that the SolrServerException does not gobble up the SolrException (which contains the actual error code). Note that as per the documentation, SolrServerException should be used only for communication / parsing issues associated with talking to SOLR. Hence it can not represent valid errors returned by the Solr server (since it does not have error-code associated with it).\n\nAlso added a unit test to verify the changes. ",
