    "description": "It's a pain to upgrade Tika's jars all the times when we release, and if Tika fails it messes up the ExtractingRequestHandler (e.g., the document type caused Tika to fail, etc). A more reliable way and also separated, and easier to deploy version of the ExtractingRequestHandler would make a network call to the Tika JAXRS server, and then call Tika on the Solr server side, get the results and then index the information that way. I have a patch in the works from the DARPA Memex project and I hope to post it soon.",
