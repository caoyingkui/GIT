This is not documented.  Maybe build the \"online only\" documentation in a separate folder.

My suggestion would be to use the same logic like for the Lucene Javadocs URL (same \"if\" statement) and if the URL is offline, leave it empty. The XSL would just do a check on empty solr-javadoc-url (if its empty) - and not the version - and then print the 2 variants (online or offline).\n\nIn addition, The first line of the groovy script misses type declaration, should be String version = ....
