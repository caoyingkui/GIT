I changed test case to use the reloadCache feature.\n\nBefore patch, the test must add dummy doc before commit to visible the external file change, I patched like this:\n\n\n-    assertU(adoc(\"id\", \"10000\")); // will get same reader if no index change\n-    assertU(commit());\n+    assertU(h.query(\"/reloadCache\",lrf.makeRequest(\"\",\"\")));\n\n\n\nI think this is ready to commit.
