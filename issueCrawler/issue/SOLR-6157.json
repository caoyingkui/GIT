Maybe I try to reproduce this locally, passing -Dtests.slow=true (the problem with this test is: its also marked as @Slow, so the normal user would never run it. And nightly it hangs a lot of times....).\nMaybe the test just does too many iterations or has too large indexes (I am not sure why it takes so long!). We may tone it down. "
