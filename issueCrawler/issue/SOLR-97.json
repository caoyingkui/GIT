The test server activation was converted from two independent functions into a singleton class with start() and stop() methods.\n\nThe functional tests have been wrapped with a ensure clause so that the solr test server will always be shut down--even if an exception was tossed during testing.\n\nBy default the solr test server will not log startup messages to STDERR, however if it's desirable to see these you can:\n\n   rake SOLR_CONSOLE=true",
