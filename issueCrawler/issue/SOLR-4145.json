However, if the resultSet is null, a NPE is thrown.\n\nIn line 254, the null check is done (if (resultSet == null))\nThe contents of line 250 should occur after the null check.\n\nI am getting the NPE after trying to delete some data in my DB using the DIH. The DIH is probably not meant for that but it would benefit me if it worked and I don't see a big change in the code in order to do it.",
