    "description": "The analyze Stream Evaluator uses a Solr analyzer to return a collection of tokens from a text field. The collection of tokens can then be streamed out by  the cartesianProduct Streaming Expression or attached to documents as multi-valued fields by the select Streaming Expression.\n\nThis allows Streaming Expressions to leverage all the existing tokenizers and filters and provides a place for future NLP analyzers to be added to Streaming Expressions.\n\nSample syntax:\n\ncartesianProduct(expr, analyze(analyzerField, textField) as outfield )\n\n\n\n\n\nselect(expr, analyze(analyzerField, textField) as outfield )\n\n\n\nCombined with Solr's batch text processing capabilities this provides an entire parallel NLP framework. Solr's batch processing capabilities are described here:\n\nBatch jobs, Parallel ETL and Streaming Text Transformation\nhttp://joelsolr.blogspot.com/2016/10/solr-63-batch-jobs-parallel-etl-and.html",

In the first pass I was mostly interested in getting the token stream from the analysis chain. What I had envisioned in the future was having analysis chains that perform sentence chunking, entity extraction, noun phrase extraction etc... I was seeing these as a finished token streams.
