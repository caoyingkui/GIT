            "content": "I think there are two problems here. One is that we are registering the request handlers twice, once on RequestHandlers.initHandlersFromConfig(...) and once in SolrResourceLoader.inform(...). The other problem is that we are using the RH classname as the name of the MBean. This will cause problems when you have multiple request handlers of the same class. I think the correct way would be to use the name defined for the request handler in the solrconfig.xml file (as we currently do with SearchComponents). I'll upload a patch for this.  "

            "content": "This fixes the issue. I chose not to modify the RequestHandler interface to add a \"setName\" method because I think it may be too much impact for this issue, Instead of it I edited the RequestHandlerBase class, but because of that I had to do some instanceofs to set the name. I'm open to other opinions on that. \nThe RH are still being registered twice now, but now with the same name, not sure if we should change that because there is no real impact.  "

I think it might be a better check than relying on names because we don't really ever want to add the same object twice - especially considering SOLR-6586.\n\n\n    for (SolrInfoMBean bean : arr) {\n      if (!infoRegistry.containsValue(bean)) {\n        try {\n          infoRegistry.put(bean.getName(), bean);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n          log.warn(\"could not register MBean '\" + bean.getName() + \"'.\", e);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n "
