And maybe DirTaxoWriter will need it in the future too. I'm fine w/ removing it for now, but note that it may be restored in the future, if a real need arises. ",

I.e., DirTaxoWriter adds indexed but not tokenized fields. Previously, you had to set an Analyzer, even if you added NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS, or otherwise you'd hit NPE.\n\nIf the tests pass, it means it's ok, because DTW is not extendable in a way that it allows you to control how documents are added. But if in the future we'll need to, we'll add this dependency back. ",
