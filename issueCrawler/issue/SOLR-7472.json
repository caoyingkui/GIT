    "description": "The SortingResponseWriter, which is the response writer for the /export handler, does not log the error that is thrown when an fl is specified that does not exist.\n\nThe reason for this is that an unchecked SolrException is being thrown from the IndexSchema. All other exceptions in SortingResponseWriter are wrapped in an IOException. \n\nFor reasons I'm not entirely sure of the ResponseUtils class doesn't log the stacktrace for errors with codes between 500 and 100. It considers these to be normal error conditions. So the unchecked SolrException was not being logged.\n\nThe short term fix for this is to catch the exception from the IndexSchema and wrap it in a IOException like the other exceptions from the SortingResponseWriter.\n\nLonger term I think it makes sense to review the ResponseUtil exception logging logic.",
