    "description": "JIRA for Jan's comments on SOLR-6513:\n\nI thought we agreed to prefer the term \"shard\" over \"slice\", so I think we should do this for this API as well.\nThe only place in our refguide we use the word \"slice\" is in How SolrCloud Works [1] and that description is disputed.\nThe refguide explanation of what a shard is can be found in Shards and Indexing Data in SolrCloud [2], quoting:\nWhen your data is too large for one node, you can break it up and store it in sections by creating one or more shards. Each is a portion of the logical index, or core, and it's the set of all nodes containing that section of the index.\nSo I'm proposing a rename of this API to BALANCESHARDUNIQUE and a rewrite of [1].\n[1] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\n[2] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Shards+and+Indexing+Data+in+SolrCloud\n\nNote Mark's comment on that JIRA, but I think it would be best to continue to talk about \"shards\" with user-facing operations.",
