    "description": "offshoot of LUCENE-3930, where shawn reported...\n\n\nI can't get either branch_3x or trunk to build now, on a system that used to build branch_3x without complaint.  It\nsays that ivy is not available, even after doing \"ant ivy-bootstrap\" to download ivy into the home directory.\nSpecifically I am trying to build solrj from trunk, but I can't even get \"ant\" in the root directory of the checkout\nto work.  I'm on CentOS 6 with oracle jdk7 built using the city-fan.org SRPMs.  Ant (1.7.1) and junit are installed\nfrom package repositories.  Building a checkout of lucene_solr_3_5 on the same machine works fine.\n\nThe root cause is that ant's global configs can be setup to ignore the users personal lib dir.  suggested work arround is to run \"ant --noconfig\" but we should also try to give the user feedback in our failure about exactly what classpath ant is currently using (because apparently ${java.class.path} is not actually it)",
