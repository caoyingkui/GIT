    "description": "Hello Guys,\n\nI am using apache solr 3.3.0 with Tikka 1.0.\n\nI have pdf files which I am pushing into solr for conent searching. Apache solr is indexing pdf files and I can see them in apache solr admin interface for search. But the issue is apache solr is not indexing whole file content. It is indexing upto only limited size.\n\nAm I missing something, some configuration, or this is the behavior of apache solr?\n\nI have tried to update solrconfig.xml. I have updated ramBufferSizeMB, maxFieldLength. \n\nThanks\nManoj Saini",
