            "content": "The source of the newline is the original newline in Codec.java ... the way we're using <containsregex/> to only pass through the line we want, and to replace the entire line with only the codec name doesn't do anything to remove the newline ... oddly enough removing $ from the pattern and using flags=\"s\" to get the final . to match (and thus ignore) the line ending doesn't seem to help.\n\nIn this patch I've added an <deletecharacters/> to remove the newline, preceded by an explicit <fixcrlf/> to ensure \\n is the only thing we might have at the end of that line, regardless of the platform defaults.\n\n\n\nThis doesn't explain why Ant 1.9.4 was converting the newline to a non-breaking space (probably something changed in the xslt tag?) but honestly i don't care as long as we fix the root problem.\n\nMy bigger concern is why documentation-lint isn't failing if/when our links have newlines in them like this?
