I peeked in the code but saw nothing obvious.",

If so .. have a look at your solrconfig.xml L1730-1736:\n\n\n<queryResponseWriter name=\"json\" class=\"solr.JSONResponseWriter\">\n  <!-- For the purposes of the tutorial, JSON responses are written as\n  plain text so that they are easy to read in *any* browser.\n  If you expect a MIME type of \"application/json\" just remove this override.\n  -->\n  <str name=\"content-type\">text/plain; charset=UTF-8</str>\n</queryResponseWriter>\n\n\nThat should do the trick?\n\nbtw: curl -I http://localhost does the same as your command, but is a bit shorter "
