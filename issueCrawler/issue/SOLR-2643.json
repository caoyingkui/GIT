    "description": "The original DisMaxQParser seems to have support for handling multiple aliases so someone could do query rewrite on more than just the default field.  If the ExtendedDisMaxQParser supported this and exposed this capability we'd be able to build more powerful rewrite capabilities such that could reduce the size of an index.  For instance say we have a scenario where we have 3 fields first_name, last_name and name.  In this situation we don't completely control the input, we may have first_name and last_name or just name.  In this case given 2 documents as follows:\n\nDoc 1\nfirst_name: John\nlast_name: Doe\n\nDoc 2\nname: Jane Doe\n\nif the user did a query on name:Doe we would be able to rewrite the query to return both documents such that the query would be name:Doe OR first_name:Doe OR last_name:Doe",
