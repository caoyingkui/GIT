    "description": "With the removal of index-time boosts, we should make it easy to combine the score with index-time factors stored in a doc-values field. We already have BoostedQuery that does it but it uses the old values source API and forcefully multiplies the value of the function with the score.\n\nI think we should move it to core, improve it and make it work with the new values source API, hopefully in a way that makes integrating expressions easy?",
