    "description": "The list expression contains a list of streams. It opens, reads and closes each stream sequentially. Sample syntax:\n\n\nlist(expr,expr, ...)\n\n\n\nThe cell expression gathers the tuples from a stream and flattens them into a list in a single celled tuple. Sample syntax:\n\n\ncell(name, expr)\n\n\n\nIn the tuple emitted by the cell expression the name param is the key which points to the flattened list.",
