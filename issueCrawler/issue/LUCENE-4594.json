    "description": "The Spatial PrefixTreeStrategy will index the center-point of a non-point shape it is given to index, in addition to the shape itself of course.  The rationale was that this point could be picked up by PointPrefixTreeFieldCacheProvider for distance/sorting.  However this approach is buggy since the distinction of grid cells between the center point and the shape itself is lost when the shape gets indexed down to max-levels precision \u2013 each grid cell therein appears to be another point that needs to be brought into memory.  It's also possible that the shape is a LineString or some other non-trivial shape in which its center point isn't actually in the shape.\n\nEven if you knew this problem would never happen, I think you're better off indexing center points into another spatial field if you want them.  Perhaps arguably this strategy could do that internally?  Wether or not that ends up happening, I just want to remove the problematic behavior now.",

Pretty simple as it just removes the undesired behavior.\n\nBack compat CHANGES.txt entry:\n\n* LUCENE-4594: Spatial PrefixTreeStrategy no longer indexes center points of\n  non-point shapes.  If you want to call makeDistanceValueSource() based on\n  shape centers, you need to do this yourself in another spatial field.\n  (David Smiley)\n\n\n\nBug CHANGES.txt entry:\n\n* LUCENE-4594: Spatial PrefixTreeStrategy would index center-points in addition\n  to the shape to index if it was non-point, in the same field.  But sometimes\n  the center-point isn't actually in the shape (consider a LineString), and for\n  highly precise shapes it could cause makeDistanceValueSource's cache to load\n  parts of the shape's boundary erroneously too.  So center points aren't\n  indexed any more; you should use another spatial field. (David Smiley)\n\n\n\nIf there are no objections or discussion then I intend to commit this Monday. ",
