    "description": "When a shape is given to a PrefixTreeStrategy (index or query time), it needs to know how many levels down the prefix tree to go for a target precision (distErrPct).  distErrPct is basically a fraction of the radius of the shape, defaulting to 2.5% (0.0025).\n\nIf the shape presented is extremely wide, > 180 degrees, then the internal calculations in SpatialArgs.calcDistanceFromErrPct(...) will wrongly measure the shape's size as having width < 180 degrees, yielding more accuracy than intended.  Given that this happens for unrealistic shape sizes and results in more accuracy, I am flagging this as \"minor\", but a bug nonetheless.  Indeed, this was discovered as a result of someone using lucene-spatial incorrectly, not for an actual shape they have.  But in the extreme [erroneous] case they had, they had 566k terms  generated, when it should have been ~1k tops.",

            "content": "A solution is to calculate the distance from a bbox corner to its center, instead of the current algorithm which takes half of the distance from opposite corners.  The only small issue to consider is that the distance from a bbox corner to its center will vary up to ~4x (worse case) depending on wether you take a top corner or bottom corner, so I could do both and take the shorter (resulting in a little more accuracy than taking the longer).

For a pathological case of nearly 360 degrees and barely any height, it would generate so many indexed terms (> 500k) that it could even cause an OutOfMemoryError. Fixed. (David Smiley)\n\n ",
