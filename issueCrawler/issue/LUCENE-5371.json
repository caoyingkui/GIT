    "description": "Today, Lucene's dynamic range faceting uses a simple linear search to\nfind which ranges match, but there are known data structures to do\nthis in log(N) time.  I played with segment trees and wrote up a blog\npost here:\n\n  http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2013/12/fast-range-faceting-using-segment-trees.html\n\nO(N) cost is actually OK when number of ranges is smallish, which is\ntypical for facet use cases, but then scales badly if there are many\nranges.",
