Passing null as CoreDescriptor was working atleast till the 14th-Aug nightly.\n\nI want to get an instance of SolrCore and am slightly confused with the CoreDescriptor, CoreContainer etc. that have been recently introduced.  The best thing for me would be a code snippet which shows how to create a SolrCore if I have a SolrConfig object and an IndexSchema object.\n\nBTW, I had posted this issue on the mailing list also and it is being discussed there also.
