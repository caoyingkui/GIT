    "description": "After creating the initial index the SpellChecker class does not provide methods to add/remove words.\n\nThe user is able to add/remove words to the F_WORD field and doing this is separate from the SpellChecker.  The down side is that the added word is not available as a suggestion because it has not been added to the other 'out of the box' fields such as start/end/gram fields.\n\nPlease consider providing public addWord/removeWord methods.",
