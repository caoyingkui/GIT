Since I know we've been collaborating on GitHub, can you create a branch, apply the change (both of which you probably have already) and send a pull request upstream referencing this issue ID in the title?  For some odd reason I can't apply your patch but it's not clear it's a problem with the patch or user-error on my part.  FYI when patches are attached to issues, they are named \"LUCENE-5825 optionalcomment.patch\" ",

The new one you posted is definitely wrong as it only includes your last commit \u2013 most likely because you've been merging trunk into your branch (please don't do that next time).  I generated a diff this way:\ngit diff --no-prefix --no-color origin/trunk...shenoy/lucene-5825 \u2013 lucene/benchmark/ > LUCENE-5825.patch\n\n\t--no-prefix: chops off the a/ & b/ git does by default on the paths.\n\t--no-color  when I redirected stdout to a file it included the color codes which rendered the file corrupt. I don't remember having to set this in the past, but whatever.\n\t-- lucene/benchmark:  I think because you merged trunk, it included stuff outside of the benchmark module, so this filtered it.\n\n\n\nIntelliJ at least applied this patch fine.\n\nI'll commit in a sec.
