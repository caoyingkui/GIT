In your \ncase, you're using a date range that expands to more than this number.  Two options that immediately \ncome to mind are to increase the number of allowed boolean clauses (at the expense of resources used \nduring the query) or to index (and query) a field by year (or quarter) such that there are far fewer terms \nthat match.
