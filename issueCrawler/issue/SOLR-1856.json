    "description": "I propose that ExtractingRequestHandler / SolrCell literals should take precedence over Tika-parsed metadata in all situations, including where multiValued=\"true\". (Compare SOLR-1633?)\n\nMy personal motivation is that I have several fields (e.g. \"title\", \"date\") where my own metadata is much superior to what Tika offers, and I want to throw those Tika values away. (I actually wouldn't mind throwing away all Tika-parsed values, but let's set that aside.) SOLR-1634 is one potential approach to this, but the fix here might be simpler.\n\nI'll attach a patch shortly.",

            "content": "Initial patch. Notes:\n\n\tWe allow literal values to override all other Tika/SolrCell stuff, including 1) fields in the Tika metadata object, 2) the Tika content field, and 3) any \"captured content\" fields\n\tCurrently literalValuesOverrideOtherValues is always true. This could be made a config option, but my intuition so far is that it's not worth the complication.\n\tIncludes an initial unit test\n\tInterestingly, all the old (and unmodified) unit tests still pass.\n\n "
