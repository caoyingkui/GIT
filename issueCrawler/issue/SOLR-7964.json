Instead the highlighted field is set while building final Solr response. The Lucene response remaining unchanged. This helps avoid unnecessary loop and data copy.\n\n\n\n\n\tAll tests are passing\n\n\n\nPlease Michael McCandless, could you be kind enough to have a look when you have the chance.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n ",
