    "description": "The LBHttpSolrClient  is referenced by HttpShardHandlerFactory.\nIn my solrcloud, I config all collection with 2 replicas.\nWhen one node of the solrcloud was stopped by a long time gc ,before  the liveNodes of zookeeper drop it , half of the requests would be timeout.\n\nShould we add a counter of connection count of all nodes?\nIf one node is stopped by gc(The node is not dead ),the connection count of this node would be larger than the other node. So most of the requests will lead to the low connection count node.",
