            "content": "patch that adds the neccessary logic to CoreContainer to throw 500 exception from getCore(name) if the name is in the list of core's with init failures.\n\nI've updated CoreContainerCoreInitFailuresTest and done some manual testing with the example webapp to verify this works right.\n\nthe one thing i'm not 100% sure of is if this is behaving the way it should when dealing with lazy loaded transient cores. From what i can tell, this should already already work because of how lazy loaded cores are created on demand, but i'm not 100% certain that i understand what's happening in all cases here.  Either wya it would be good to have a test of this.\n\nErick Erickson: if you could take a look and give me some guidance on how it should work, and how to write a good test for that it would be appreciated.

I took a look at your tests and I think I can just add a test for the return code == 500 to the ones that I've already written verifying that the tests return the message I expect. There's some infrastructure over in TestLazyCores for creating lazy core defs that I can leverage. Take me about 5 minutes.\n\nDoes that work for you? "
