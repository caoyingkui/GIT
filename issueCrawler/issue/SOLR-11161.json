Not yet fully tried but I think this will fix the plain bin/solr stop scenario but would break bin/solr stop -all and perhaps also bin/solr stop -p ...' usage.\n\nSeparately it might be nice to factor the 'SOLR_PORT minus 1000' logic into a little function (it's currently repeated in at least two places).
