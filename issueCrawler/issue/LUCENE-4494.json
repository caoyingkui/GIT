Thanks! Feel free to email.\n\nFYI: It my first contribitution so be gentle  C# is my native.\n\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_rating_approach",

In short, if I knew how to do it I would, I'm still a bit of a newbie you see!\nI received some advice previously (not sure how good it was now) that indicated that the codecs are rarely touched, so I decided to add the patch to the Lucene solution and hope that someone with more experience that I, would do some handholding with me or relocate it.\nJe suis desole  ",
