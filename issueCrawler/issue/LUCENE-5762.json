    "description": "Currently, because of updatable docvalues, ancient codecs are not really read-only... this is a real problem because we can get confused about backwards compatibility or even introduce bugs.\n\nIts only necessary to make BINARY and NUMERIC work here, we should throw UOE every other possible place and prevent use of old codecs to the greatest extent possible.",
