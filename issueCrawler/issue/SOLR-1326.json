    "description": "There is no way for a plugin to know the information of the attributes mentioned in the tag itself (like name). We should have a new interface to initialize with PluginInfo such as \n\npublic interface PluginInfoInitialized{\n  public void init(PluginInfo pluginInfo);\n}\n\n\nThe PluginInfo class has been enhanced to allow sub components as well. So the current syntax of UpdateprocessorChain/highlighter can also be supported by implementing this interface .",
