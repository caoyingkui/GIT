    "description": "Servlet Engines (Tomcat & Jetty) do not allow you to write binary payload when the HTTP response code is not 200. Therefore, when an error occurs during a request and wt=javabin then although the response to the client has the correct HTTP response code (4xx/5xx), it has no binary payload. Instead, tomcat sends out a character stream with stack traces which causes an exception in the clients because they were expecting a binary payload.",

The default version for javabin is 1.0 whereas for xml is 2.3. But if we start writing XML payload on error, then XMLResponseWriter uses javabin's version (1.0) which corresponds to the older XML format (which is again unparseable by the solrj client). "
