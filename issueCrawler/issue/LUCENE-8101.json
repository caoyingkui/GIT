    "description": "If I sort my index by a doc values field A, then run a query like NumericDocValuesField.newSlowExactQuery(A, 10), it should somehow be possible to run that query efficiently, i.e. it will be a compact range of doc ids that match.\n\nThe challenge is, without an inverted structure, how will we know exactly which range of docIDs?  If the field is also indexed e.g. as points, we could use that to locate the min/max docID, maybe?",
