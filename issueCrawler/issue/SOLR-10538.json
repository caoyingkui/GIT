    "description": "In some cases it is necessary to index unchanged keywords and phonetic mapped text in just one field. In my example it is needed, to add ids in the form \"prefix<letters>+number<digits>\"\nThe current implementation of the BeiderMorseFilter strips the digits and maps the remaining letters. As result, all ids with the same prefix become equal. \n\nTo avoid this, the BeiderMorseFilter should respect the keyword attribute.\nI prepared a patch for the implementation and the test class, which adds the evaluation of keywordAtt.isKeyword().",
