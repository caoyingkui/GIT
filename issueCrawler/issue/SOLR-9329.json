    "description": "We just upgraded Solr version from 3.6 to 5.5.1 but the replication does not seem to work as expected. We would like to replicate index on slaves only after optimize but what I noticed is that if I restarted solr master it lost the info related to last replicable index and calling /replication?command=invexversion is getting the last committed index not the last optimized one.\nIf I leave it running, after first optimize command happens it works as expected and command=invexversion gives me last optimized index.\nWe're running it as docker container.\n\nThis is the requestHandler section we're using in both master and slaves:\n\n <requestHandler name=\"/replication\" class=\"solr.ReplicationHandler\">\n        <lst name=\"master\">\n            <str name=\"enable\">${solr.master.enable:false}</str>\n            <str name=\"replicateAfter\">optimize</str>\n            <str name=\"backupAfter\">optimize</str>\n        </lst>\n        <str name=\"maxNumberOfBackups\">${solr.numberOfVersionToKeep:3}</str>\n        <lst name=\"slave\">\n            <str name=\"enable\">${solr.slave.enable:false}</str>\n            <str name=\"masterUrl\">${solr.master.url:}/replication</str>\n            <str name=\"pollInterval\">${solr.replication.pollInterval:00:00:30}</str>\n        </lst>\n    </requestHandler>",
