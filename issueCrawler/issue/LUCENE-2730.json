DocumentsWriter idles all other threads before calling abort so we don't need to sync.  I'll also remove this from trunk and 3.x.\n\nTestAtomicUpdate's deadlock only happens when autoCommit=true, when one thread has called commit and the flush by that commit tries to spawn new merges, which enters CMS who then hits the max merge thread count and waits for merge threads to finish while another merge thread is attempting an autoCommit.  I don't think we need to make any changes to 3.x/trunk for this (autoCommit is gone). ",

IW still calls freeRAM in 3.x/4.0, but it's a no-op there since we don't recycle RAM as aggressively anymore.  So likely we could remove sync from TermsHash on 3.x/trunk, but let's do that another day... ",
