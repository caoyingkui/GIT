This is blocking the usage of latest updates from S3.\n\nIt would be greatly helpful if someone could revise the jackson-core jar in Solr to the latest version.

Hadoop stopping at 2.7.x is surprising to me, but it looks like they are planning on jackson 2.8.x in hadoop 3 (which will happen may or may not happen in our lifetimes).\n\nWhile I'd generally suggest using the last patch release of the minimum supported version we need to get things working (2.6.7) for client compat reasons, the security fixes in only present in 2.7.x+ push me towards that instead.\n\ntl;dr: I trust Jackson to be largely compatible across the board, and where possible we should not hold ourselves to Hadoop's \"latest and greatest of 2005\" philosophy.
