It doesn't change the error-case handling around each of this uses though.  The direct ClusterState methods will return null when the collection information cannot be found; the non-deprecated replacement calls throw a SolrException instead.  Ends up causing a lot of test failures with the patch as is.\n\nIn the process of changing out the error handling for some of these calls.  Will update the patch when I can get tests passing locally.

Though I see in hindsight that my comment was ambiguous.\n\nReferences to the \"attached patch\" above are referring to the patch added in July of last year.  I'm working on an updated patch locally, but I'm still coaxing it through some test failures and making error-handling tweaks surrounding those method calls where appropriate.  Hope to have it up later today.\n\nRelatedly, this JIRA only explicitly covers getSlicesMap, getSlices, and getActiveSlices.  The July-2016 patch limits its changes to those methods.  But there are a number of other deprecated methods in ClusterState.  Should usage of these methods be removed as well?\n\n\tgetLeader\n\tgetReplica\n\tgetSlice\n\tgetActiveSlicesMap\n\tgetCollections\n\tgetZkClusterStateVersion\n\n ",

All tests pass locally.\n\nAs I mentioned above, two questions about this issue:\n\n\n\tClusterState has a number of other deprecated methods not mentioned in the issue title.  Should any remaining usage of these also be cleaned up?  (I've held off from doing so in this version of the patch, but I can add that in you want).\n\tI've removed all usage of the 3 clusterState methods.  I've also removed those 3 deprecated methods.  We're approaching the 7.X branch and I've seen a lot of traffic lately around removing deprecated methods prior to that, so it seemed like the right thing to do.  If I made the wrong call here though, it's quick enough to reverse, and I'm happy to do that.\n\n ",

            "content": "Updated patch removes the usage of all deprecated methods from ClusterState, with the exception of getZkClusterStateVersion.  All tests pass locally.\n\ngetZkClusterStateVersion has no successor in the DocCollection class, so removing the few places it is used is a less obvious swap.  Since the method is used to determine whether the ClusterState has changed since some access/read, my first hunch is that ClusterState.hashCode might be a suitable replacement for determining this.\n\nClusterState.hashCode bases the hash largely off of the ZK-node-version.  Since getZkClusterStateVersion was deprecated out of concerns for its use of Zk-node-version (see javadocs), it doesn't really seem in the spirit of the deprecation to replace calls with ClusterState.hashCode.  At least as hashCode is written now.\n\nDo you have any advice/suggestions/opinions on what we can replace those getZkClusterStateVersion calls with? ",

            "content": "Ishan Chattopadhyaya any suggestions on how to replace that last deprecated method (getZkClusterStateVersion)?\n\nBased on my somewhat-naive understanding of the code involved, my suggestion/vote would be to work towards a solution where ZkStateWriter maintains a node with the express purpose of tracking the versioning of the ClusterState nodes.  The reason for deprecating getZkClusterStateVersion wouldn't be relevant anymore, and we could un-deprecate the method.  \n\nBut that would stretch the scope of this JIRA beyond the initial aim.  Would it be reasonable to split the resolution of getZkClusterStateVersion into a separate JIRA, since it appears more involved than a find-replace?   ",
