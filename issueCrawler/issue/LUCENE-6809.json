    "description": "DictionaryCompoundWordTokenFilter is very useful for building German search indices. However this can also lead to ambiguities as words might be extracted which have a completely different meaning. Most often this happens if the remaining parts of the word are too small.\n\nExample: schwein (German for pig) contains wein (German for wine). Even if minSubwordSize is set to 4, wein gets extracted though sch is shorter than 4 characters.\n\nWe could solve this by requiring all word parts to be part of the dictionary (at most 3), but this creates problems with compound words of more than three nouns.\n\nTherefore we have built an alternate solution where minSubwordSize is also applied to the rest of the fragments. We have tested this in several (large) customer indices and it is working much better than before.",
