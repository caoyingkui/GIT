I think we should entirely change the way this query can be introspected, by removing getTermData, adding a getter for the field like you did, and also adding a way to get access to the term bytes using a standard java collection, similarly to PointInSetQuery.getPackedPoints (which is TermInSetQuery's equivalent for points).
