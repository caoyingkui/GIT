    "description": "Add full support for long searches executed in steps.\n\nQueryFilters only support narrowing down a set of results, they don't allow extending it with OR clauses. They also don't allow to add new clauses to SpanQueries.\n\nThis facility is needed because repeatedly creating new queries and executing a full, more complicated query at each step is not efficient for search sessions where you may have chains of hundreds of such steps.",
