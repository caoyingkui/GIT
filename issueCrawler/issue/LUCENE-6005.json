    "description": "Auto-prefix terms (LUCENE-5879) is blocked because it's impossible in\nLucene today to add a simple API to use it, and I don't think we\nshould commit features that only super-experts can figure out how to\nuse: that's evil.\n\nThe only realistic \"workaround\" for such new features is to instead\nadd them directly to the various servers on top of Lucene, since they\nall already have nice schema APIs.\n\nI opened LUCENE-5989 to try do at least a baby step towards making it\neasier to use auto-prefix terms, so you can easily add singleton\nbinary tokens, but even that has proven controversial.\n\nNet/net I think we have to solve the root cause of this by fixing the\nDocument/Field/FieldType API so that new index-level features can have\na usable API, properly defaulted for the right types of fields.\n\nTowards that, I'm exploring a replacement for\nDocument/Field/FieldType.  The idea is to expose simple methods on the\ndocument class (no more separate Field and FieldType classes):\n\n\n    doc.addLargeText(\"body\", \"some text\");\n    doc.addShortText(\"title\", \"a title\");\n    doc.addAtom(\"id\", \"29jafnn\");\n    doc.addBinary(\"bytes\", new byte[7]);\n    doc.addNumber(\"number\", 17);\n\n\n\nAnd then expose a separate FieldTypes class, that you pass to ctor of\nthe new document class, which lets you set all the various per-field\nsettings (stored, doc values, etc.).  E.g.:\n\n\n    types.enableStored(\"id\");\n\n\n\nFieldTypes is a write-once schema, and it throws exceptions if you try\nto make invalid changes once a given setting is already written\n(e.g. enabling norms after having disabled them).  It will (I haven't\nimplemented this yet) save its state into IndexWriter's commitData, so\nit's available when you open a new IndexWriter for append and when you\nopen a reader.\n\nIt has methods to set all the per-field settings (analyzer, stored,\nterm vectors, norms, index options, doc values type), and chooses\n\"reasonable\" defaults based on the value's type when it suddenly sees\na new field.  For example, when you add a number, it's indexed for\nrange querying and sorting (numeric doc values) by default.\n\nFieldTypes provides the analyzer and codec (a little messy) that you\npass to IndexWriterConfig.  Since it's effectively a persistent\nschema, it knows all about the available fields at search time, so we\ncould use it to create queries (checking if they are valid given that\nfield's type).  Query parsers and highlighters could consult it.\nDefault UIs (above Lucene) could use it, etc.  This is all future .. I\nthink for this issue the goal should be to \"just\" provide a \"better\"\nindex-time API but not yet make use of it at search time.\n\nSo with this change, for auto-prefix terms, we could add an \"enable\nrange queries/filters\" option, but then validate that the selected\npostings format supports such an option.\n\nI know this exploration will be horribly controversial, but\nrealistically I don't think Lucene can move on much further if we\ncan't finally address this schema problem head on.\n\nThis is long overdue.",

You can skip the\nAPI entirely and it will \"learn\" your schema by seeing which Java\ntypes you are adding to your documents and setting sensible defaults\naccordingly.  It's quite a bit simpler than the current oal.document\nAPI: no more separate XXXField nor FieldType classes.\n\nIndexed binary tokens work, via Document2.addAtom(...) (LUCENE-5989).\n\nYou can turn on/off sorting for a field, and this \"translates\" to the\nappropriate DV type; I want to improve this by letting you specify the\ndefault sort order, and also [eventually] specify collator.  I plan to\nsimilarly enable highlighting.\n\nI also added search-time APIs, e.g. newSort, newTermQuery,\nnewRangeQuery.  These methods throw clear exceptions if the field name\nis unknown, or it wasn't indexed with a type that \"matches\" that\nmethod.\n\nThere are still many issues and nocommits:\n\n\n\tAnalyzer is passed to FieldTypes now; I would like to remove it\n    from IndexWriterConfig.  To do this, I think I need to push\n    multi-valued field handling out of IndexWriter up into \"user\n    space\"... I already removed IndexableFieldType.tokenized as a\n    first step.\n\n\n\n\n\tAnalyzers can't be serialized, so the app will have to\n    re-initialize them on startup (like they must do anyway today with\n    PFAW).  Same for Similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\tYou can only set per-field DVF and PF.\n\n\n\n\n\tI only cutover a couple tests, but they lose randomness since\n    FieldTypes provides the default IWC, vs LTC.newIWC().\n\n\n\n\n\tI had to suck in a fork of KeywordTokenizer.\n\n ",
