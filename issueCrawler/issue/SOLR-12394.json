    "description": "NodeConfig has a property called managmentPath config which doesn't appear to serve any coherent function and is in fact documented in https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_3/format-of-solr-xml.html\u00a0as:\nmanagementPath\n\nCurrently non-operational.\nThe code appears to have been added initially in SOLR-695, and that ticket appears to relate to\u00a0an elimination\u00a0of a special case for single core configurations. It seems that this may have been an attempt to support single cores that had no name (a legacy mode of operation I guess, but before my time) and yet still allow such single core setups to later have additional cores added?\n\nSo this ticket is a suggestion that we remove this configuration that\u00a0allegedly isn't working anyway, OR we make it work and give it good clear documentation in code and in the ref guide so that folks don't have to waste a lot of time figuring out what it does(n't do) to understand the code.\n\nAttaching patch to remove it.",
