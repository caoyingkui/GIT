    "description": "After the patch for SOLR-4972 was introduced, the usage for zkcli.sh -cmd makepath changed to\n\nzkcli.sh -zkhost localhost:9983 -cmd makepath /apache/solr/data.txt 'config data'\n\nYet that is not what the command expects, it expects just a single path to create, no data can be supplied.\n\n\"put\" is the new way to create an actual file in ZK.\n\nAm assuming makepath should have stayed as it was (so command is correct, but usage is wrong), alternatively usage might be right and makepath could be a superset of PUT (but that seems unlikely)",
