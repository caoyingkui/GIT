However, it's useful also to report non-numeric values such as eg. version, disk type, component state, some system properties, etc.\n\nCodahale Gauge<T> metric type can be used for this purpose, and convenience methods can be added to SolrMetricManager to make it easier to use.",

            "content": "Initial patch. Some classes have been converted to use the new style for Gauge registration eg. SolrIndexWriter. See SolrCore.initializeMetrics for an example of non-numeric registrations.\n\nAlso, I added the ability to produce a much more compact NamedList format in MetricUtils, which is used in the output from /admin/metrics. We should consider using it by default, although it's not back-compatible with the format in 6x. ",
