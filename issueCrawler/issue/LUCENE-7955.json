    "description": "Hi Karl Wright,\n\nI propose to add new type of shape for GeoPaths that have a cutoffangle < MINIMUM_RESOLUTION. We can define it as a shape consisting of points exactly on the path.\nIt would be a much lighter version of GeoStandardPath and created only when the cutoff angle is between 0 and MINIMUM_RESOLUTION.\n\nThanks!\n\nIgnacio",
