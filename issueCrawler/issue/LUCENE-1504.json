Just leave the default, that get removed on 3.0. As the code was not released before the deprecation, there would be nobody using it and it does not make sense to add APIs that are deprecated from the beginning.\n\nTrieRangeFilter was also included after the change and never implemented bits() [it implemented it in the past, but at this time it was in another package outside of lucene, so deprecation is out of responsibility for lucene].\n\nPaul:\nIn case you prefer to use one of these, a dependency on the corresponding contrib module may have to be added in the build process of the spatial contrib.\n\nVery interesting, on thinking about how to include TrieRangeQuery with spatial contrib, I was thining about a dependency, but I was not sure, if it is possible. How can it be done in the build.xml of the contrib? ",

When we move this to core, I suggest to use OpenBitSet here. Just change the method signature, it is unreleased code and so we can change it easily. But you must then rewrite spatial to also use OpenBitSet (but it is just a search'n'replace).\n\tISerialChainFilter seems to be a strange name, I have never seen such in Lucene Core. Do you mean \"I\"nterface with it (but its an abstract class). I would suggest to use SerialChainFilter as it is, and for the chained filters itsself use ChainFilter.\n\tThere are some of these autogenerated catch blocks in the code, please remove them and pass the Exception through the method declaration. So bits() should throw IOException and so on (this is one of the things, why I hate Eclipse..., searching through the internet you see everywhere this code with these auto-generated blocks!)\n\n ",

FilteredDocIdSet doesn't handle the SERIALOR case, but, nothing uses SERIALOR now (I think?) so I think that's OK.  I'll change LatLong/GeoHashDistanceFilter to extend FilteredDocIdSet. ",

In my opinion, this is not, what the new DocIdSet should do. The Filter chaining should be done in the iterator.\n\nAnother approach would be to use the BooleanFilter from contrib/search! It has all the functionality provided by Ryans class. We would only need to have build dependency between contrib/spatial and contrib/queries. ",

If this improvement can not get the attention it deserves before 2.9 release, the SerialChainFilter could still be removed/moved/modified at a later release. ",
