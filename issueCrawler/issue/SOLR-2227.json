    "description": "Hi guys,\n\nI am having weird problem. I am currently using solr 1.5-dev. Wanted to switch to 4.0. Have dropped my indexes as they are not backward compatible and have run DIH. All data have been indexed and were even searchable for a short while, after that all have been suddenly dropped.\n\nAll is working fine on 1.5 so it force me to thinking that it must be some kind of bug in 4.0\n\nP.S.\nSorry for posting twice but couldn't see it under solr 4.0 section\n\ncheers,\n/Marcin",
