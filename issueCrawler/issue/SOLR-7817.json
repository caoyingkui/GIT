    "description": "We have solr.test.sys.prop1 and solr.test.sys.prop2 system properties in the widely used solrconfig.xml and it would make sense to move these to a different solrconfig which can be used by the tests that need this.\n\nSetting this system property in the test base class isn't good, specially as writing a new test that doesn't extend on the existing test base classes requires the knowledge of setting these if you want to use the widely used solrconfig.xml.\n\nHere's another conversation about the same from 2007:\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-dev/200703.mbox/%3Cc68e39170703291430w5a57f603p7f0b7412d7cbb419@mail.gmail.com%3E",
