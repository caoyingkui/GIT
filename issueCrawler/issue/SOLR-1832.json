    "description": "In 1.4 setting the \"abortOnConfigurationError\" config option to \"false\" only affects RequestHandlers and schema related classes (ie: FieldType and Token*Factories).\n\nValueSourceParsers, QParserPlugins, and ResposneWriters which fail to initalize properly in Solr 1.4 will cause the entire SolrCore to fail to initialize.  This changed from previous version: In Solr 1.3 a failure to init any of these types of plugins when abortOnConfigurationError=false would result in errors being logged on init, but the SolrCore itself would still work and only attempts to use those plugins  would result in an error.",
