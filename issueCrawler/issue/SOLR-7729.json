    "description": "Some of the methods in ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient accept an aditional collection parameter, some of this methods are: add(String collection, SolrInputDocument doc) and request(SolrRequest, String collection). \n\nThis collection parameter is being ignored in this cases but works for others like commit(String collection).\n\nShawn Heisey noted that:\n\nLooking into how an update request actually gets added to the background\nqueue in ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient, it appears that the \"collection\"\ninformation is ignored before the request is added to the queue.\n\nFrom the source, when a commit is issued or the UpdateParams.WAIT_SEARCHER is set in the request params the collection parameter is used, otherwise the request UpdateRequest req is queued without any regarding of the collection.",

It fixes the issue on my development environment (solrj 5.2.1).\n\nI added two unit tests to ConcurrentUpdateSolrClientTest:\n\n\tthe simple testCollectionParameters, duplicated from BasicHttpSolrClientTest\n\ta second test using SendDocsRunnable to send multiple concurrent add requests, using the collection parameter\n\n\n\nFeel free to modify it (or ask me to rework it) if it doesn't meet solr's quality standards.
