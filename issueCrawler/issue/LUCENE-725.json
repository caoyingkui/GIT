    "description": "This is a class I have found to be useful for analyzing small (in the hundreds) collections of documents and  removing any duplicate content such as standard disclaimers or repeated text in an exchange of  emails.\nThis has applications in sampling query results to identify key phrases, improving speed-reading of results with similar content (eg email threads/forum messages) or just removing duplicated noise from a search index.\n\nTo be more generally useful it needs to scale to millions of documents - in which case an alternative implementation is required. See the notes in the Javadocs for this class for more discussion on this",
