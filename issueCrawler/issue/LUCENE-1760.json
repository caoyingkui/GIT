I'd still like to look over and polish a bit - but I think this covers the broad strokes.\n\nOne thing I would like to clear up, but I'm not exactly sure what its saying:\n\n\n\t{@link TokenStream} now extends {@link AttributeSource}, which provides\n * access to all of the token {@link Attribute}s for the {@link TokenStream}\n.\n\tNote that only one instance per \n{@link AttributeImpl} is created and reused\n * for every token. This approach reduces object creation and allows local\n * caching of references to the {@link AttributeImpl}\ns. See\n\t{@link #incrementToken()}\n for further details.\n\n ",

Should I add the remove when api is removed reminder here? The Javadoc appears a bit misleading.\n\n*edit\n\nI guess my issue is, it appears ambiguous as to what method must be implemented. @depreacted gives you the hint, but I'm just going to reword to make clear.
