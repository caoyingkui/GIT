            "content": "Hmmm, this is an invalid field definition, you have to have at least one tokenizer or your field doesn't do anything.\n\nI can mask the error with a couple of trivial changes (see patch attached) but I don't think that's really a good fix. It seems we should (in order of my preference, either of my two <1>'s work for me)\n\n1> fail hard at startup and force a valid fieldType definition before continuing.\n1> default to WhitespaceTokenizer if no analysis chain defined. I can make get onboard with this being reasonable behavior\n2> do nothing. I think this is a bad solution, violates the \"fail early\" policy, doesn't fail until someone happens to do a wildcard\n3> put in a trivial fix (two places have to test for null like in the patch). I don't like this either, I'm sure Junaid's next question would be that results weren't as expected, everyone wastes time then.\n\nAnyone want to weigh in? "

            "content": "Actually, on a second look I think the original patch is the right thing to do. There is actually a default tokenizer assigned to a TextField, admittedly it is rudimentary, but it's still defined. So my original statement was entirely wrong, a TextField type with no analysis chain is perfectly correct, it was entirely a problem with the MultiTermAware code. Fixing it with the original patch is fine. I'll add a test too. "
