    "description": "(from email by Robert Oschler)\n\n(Would be useful to have)... a convenient \"playground\" for testing index and query filters?\n\nI'm  imagining a utility where you can select a set of index and query\nfilters, and then enter  a string as a test \"document\" and a query string\nand see what kind of scores come back during a matching attempt.  This\nwould be a big aid in crafting an indexing/query scheme to get the desired\nmatching profile working.  Otherwise the only technique I can think of is\nto iteratively modify the schema file and retest with the admin panel with\neach combination of filters.",

            "content": "Well, that was possible with static schema too, really. Just rewrite the file, reload the core.\n\nThe issue is making user-friendly UI. Which means:\n*) Having a list of all possible analytizers\n*) Having all their various options described/self-described\n*) Running the same query through several stacks at once\n\nOtherwise, it is not a playground but a slog. Hence a question of whether it is worth the effort to do that. ",
