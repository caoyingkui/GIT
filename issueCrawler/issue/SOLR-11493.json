    "description": "I thought I'd found another bug because one of 4 variants didn't have a loop, but then I noticed that the method in question was being fed a list, and the very first thing it does is loop that list... so it seems there is no need to loop the list, create and pass in a singleton list, and then have the method loop that singleton list to process a single item... \n\nFixing this should save us a bit of object creation & therefore reduce GC load.",
