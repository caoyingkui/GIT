    "description": "I'd like to change Multi/DirIndexReader so that they no longer implement the low level methods of IndexReader, and instead act more like an ordered collection of sub readers.  I think to do this we'd need a new interface, common to atomic readers (SegmentReader) and the composite readers, which IndexSearcher would accept.\n\nWe should also require that the core Query scorers always receive an atomic reader.\n\nWe've taken strong initial steps here with flex, by forcing users to use separate MultiFields static methods to obtain Fields/Terms/etc. from a composite reader.  This issue is to finish this cutover.",
