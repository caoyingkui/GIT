    "description": "Hello\n\nI encoutered a problem when i tried to index large document collections\n(about 20 mio documents).\nThe indexing failed with the IOException:\n\n\"Cannot delete deletables\"\n\nI tried different times (with the same document collection) and allways \nreceived the error, but after a different number\nof documents.\n\nThe exception is thrown after failing to delete the specfied file at\nline 212 in FSDirectory.java.\nI found the following cure:\n\nafter the lines\n   if (nu.exists())\n      if (!nu.delete()){\n\ni replaced\n<   throw new IOException(\"Cannot delete \" + to);\n\nwith\n>        while(nu.exists()){\n>            nu.delete();\n>            System.out.println(\"delete loop\");\n>            try \n{\n>                Thread.sleep(5000);\n>            }\n catch (InterruptedException e) \n{\n>                throw new RuntimeException(e);\n>            }\n\nThat is, now i retry deleting the file until it is successful.\n\nAfter the changes, i was able to index all documents.\n\nFrom the fact that i observed several times\n\n  \"delete loop\"\n\non the output console, it can be deduced that the \nbody of the while loop was reached (and left) several times.\n\n\nI am running lucene on windows xp.\n\nRegards\nThilo",
