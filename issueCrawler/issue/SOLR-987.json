    "description": "Need a way to use Data Import Handler to index non-XML (i.e. simple text) files (either via HTTP or FileSystem)?  This would assist in putting the entire contents of a text file into a single field of a document for which the other fields are being pulled out of another DataSource.  An EntityProcessor looks like the right place for this as it may help us add more attributes if needed.  We could also consider support for other file formats (PDF, office, etc.), which may overlap with some of the Extraction/Tika work.",
