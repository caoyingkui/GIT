If this workaround won't work for you, there is currently no fix for this \u2013 the patch attached to this issue is a test case that shows the problem, not a fix.\n\nThe issue claims that the problem doesn't exist in 4.x, and based on the overall lack of interest in the year since it was filed, it probably won't receive any committer attention.  If I had any idea how highlighting worked, I would be willing to give it a try. "
