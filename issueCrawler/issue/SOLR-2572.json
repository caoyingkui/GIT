    "description": "Spinoff from SOLR-2567.\n\nCurrently configuration of a mergepolicy in solr is by lucene classname (must have no-arg ctor), and \nsome merge-policy specific configuration parameters are not per-mergepolicy, but instead with the rest of the index configuration.\n\nI think we should make this more pluggable, so that we can fully configure things like TieredMergePolicy,\nand also so that if someone wants to plug in their own MP they can do that too.",
