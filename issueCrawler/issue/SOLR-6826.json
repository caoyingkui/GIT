    "description": "For legacy reasons, both fieldtype and fieldType are acceptable in schema.xml. However, XML is case sensitive and this causes confusion when people see both fieldtype and fieldType used in official examples. \n\nThis causes them to assume that maybe our particular XML is not case sensitive and then they mis-case other elements, such as dynamicField, which are then silently ignored.",
