            "content": "Thanks Alexander. We shouldn't use replaceAll directly because that will cause the Pattern to be recompiled on each replace which is very wasteful. So I've reverted the code to use the original getPattern method but we return the original value if the regex doesn't match. I've added a test as well. "
