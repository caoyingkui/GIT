    "description": "This ticket proposes to refactor the existing preferLocalShards implementation (from SOLR-6832 and SOLR-8298) based upon the recent (in SOLR-8332) ReplicaListTransformer addition.\n\nThe intention of the refactor is to encapsulate the local shard url selection logic within the HttpShardHandlerFactory.getReplicaListTransformer method (it is currently spread across the public HttpShardHandler.prepDistributed and the private HttpShardHandler.getURLs method) and to thus remove the ResponseBuilder.preferredHostAddress field.",
