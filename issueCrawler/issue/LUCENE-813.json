            "content": "I fixed the PREFIX definition in QueryParser.jj, changed:\n         (<_TERM_START_CHAR> | \"\") (<_TERM_CHAR>) \"*\" >\nto \n         (\"\") | ( <_TERM_START_CHAR> (<_TERM_CHAR>) \"*\" ) >\nwhich I think is more correct, and this solved the problem. \n\nHowever this caused another parsing test (testSimple) to fail - aparently from other reasons: the standard analyzer used in that test is lower casing the query tokens, which have umlauts - and this fails, because the lower casing is done char by char (Character.lowercase). I think that the wrong definition of PREFIXTERM was masking this behavior before. I am not sure yet if this is a bug, but for testSimple to pass for now I would modify the test to use a non lowercasing analyzer when umlauts are present. Please comment if you think this is a bug.\n\nAnother tehnical issue that came up is line endings - compiling on XP, using cygwin, the javacc result files had wrong line endings.\nFixed that with \n   perl -p -e 's/(\\r\\n|\\n|\\r)/\\n/g'  QueryParser.java_fromJavacc > QueryParser,java\nDo others have this problem?\nIs there is a standard solution for this (other than installing *Nix?)\nIf not I may look into allowing to fix this by build.xml.\n\nWill have a patch with the fix later today.
