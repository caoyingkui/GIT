    "description": "We have a product which indexes some files. The indexer and the query parser use\nthe same analyzer. This analyzer applies the LowerCaseFilter to the terms. The\nprocedure works just fine for most of our queries, but there's a problem when a\nmore complex query is issued. I will describe the problem in the following examples:\n\nQuery: term1 +term2 term3\nResult: Works\n\nQuery: term1 +term2* term3\nResult: Works\n\nQuery: term1 +Term2* term3\nResult: Doesn't work\nIt seems that terms containig wildcards are not processed by the analyzer. \nAs the indexes contain only lowercase words, there will never be hits for this\nquery.",
