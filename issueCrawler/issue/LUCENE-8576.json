    "description": "We currently have two ways for polygon queries when using Geo3DPoint, newPolygonQuery and newLargePolygonQuery. This is due to the fact that there are two implementation for creating polygons in spatial3d.\n\nIn LUCENE-8220, it was added a new polygon factory method that chooses the best polygon implementation to use depending on the provided polygon. We could simplify the interface by using this factory method in newPolygonQuery and probably deprecate newLargePolygonQuery.",
