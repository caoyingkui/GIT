I want to get this into jenkins to see the affects on chaosmonkey tests.\n\nI think SOLR-5593 was hiding / protecting against some issues around this. It also fits with some fails even before that I was trying to figure out and seemed to make no sense unless the client was resending the same update even while we were internally retrying to send an update to a leader.
