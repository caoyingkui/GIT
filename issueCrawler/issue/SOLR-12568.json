    "description": "I've seen cases where a node that was out of service, once it reconnects, all the replicas hosted in it will try to recover at the same time. In some cases this can cause the host to run out of disk space (for reasons that can cause replication to duplicate the index size, like a new leader, or simply segment churn). I'm mostly thinking in throttling the number of parallel recoveries in a node, but maybe it's also useful to throttle per collection/cluster for other reasons",

            "content": "Hmmm, seems like you'd also get replicas back faster if I/O throttling so this seems like a good idea.\n\nLet's say you've throttled I/O to 100MBPS and have 4 replicas recovering at once. And for simplicity, let's also claim the indexes are all exactly the same size. They'd all come back at once T seconds from now in parallel, whereas if they're only recovering one at a time you'd get one back live every T/4 seconds. ",
