Specifically:\n\n\n\ttimeToString calls Calendar.getInstance on every call.\n\tdateToString calls timeToString(date.getTime()), which then instantiates a new Date(). I think we should change the order of the calls, or not have each call the other.\n\tround(), which is called from timeToString (after creating a Calendar instance) creates another  Calendar instance ...\n\n\n\nSeems that if we synchronize the methods and create the Calendar instance once (static), it should solve it.",

Since we're both on the fence, and you'll be the one committing it, I'll let you make the call \n\nIf you decide to remove the sync, I can either post a new patch, or you can apply the current one and remove the sync before committing.

The first two lines look like this right now:\n\ncalInstance.setTimeInMillis(round(time, resolution));\nDate date = calInstance.getTime();\n\n\n\nInstead, it can simply be:\n\nDate date = new Date(round(time, resolution));\n\n\n.\n\nSecondly... I think a good deal of logic can be cleaned up in the other methods instead of a bunch of if-else statements that is a bad code smell.  Most of the logic of 3 of those methods could be put into Resolution and be made tighter. ",

But performance-wise I don't think it would make such a big difference, as we're already comparing instances, which should be relatively fast.\n\nHow will moving the logic of timeToString, stringToDate and round to Resolution make the code tighter? Resolution would still need to check its instance type in order to execute the right code. Unless we subclass Resolution internally and have each subclass implement just the code section of these 3, that it needs? ",

            "content": "Applying the attached patch shows the improvements to DateTools.java that I think should be done.  All logic that does anything at all is moved to instance methods of the inner class Resolution.  I argue this is more object-oriented.\n\n1. In cases where Resolution is an argument to the method, I can simply invoke the appropriate call on the Resolution object.  Formerly there was a big branch if/else.\n2. Instead of \"synchronized\" being used seemingly everywhere, synchronized is used to sync on the object that is not threadsafe, be it a DateFormat or Calendar instance.\n3. Since different DateFormat and Calendar instances are created per-Resolution, there is now less lock contention since threads using different resolutions will not use the same locks.\n4. The old implementation of timeToString rounded the time before formatting it.  That's unnecessary since the format only includes the resolution desired.\n5.round() now uses a switch statement that benefits from fall-through (no break).\n\nAnother debatable improvement is putting the resolution instances into an array indexed by format length.  This would mean I could remove big-ish switch in lookupResolutionByLength() and avoid the length constants there... but I don't think that's a big deal. ",
