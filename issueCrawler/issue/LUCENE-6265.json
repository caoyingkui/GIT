So if the operating system makes .DS_Store, thumbs.db, .nfsXXXXX, it shouldnt matter.\n\nA few tests are sensitive to exact file names (they tend to be a pain for us anyway, when we change codecs and so on), these tests can use SuppressFileSystems annotation in LUCENE-6264 to prevent this.",

            "content": "Cool. Maybe instead of extraXXX as file name also use the list of known offenders like .DSStore to emulate more real-world examples. We can just have a list of them. Another idea would be to let it create \"backup\" files by adding another file with \"~\" or \".bak\" at end whenever an IndexOutput is created. This is also interesting, because those files could somehow match our file name patterns. "
