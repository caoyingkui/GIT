    "description": "I'm indexing a document with a field which is aaa bbb ccc ddd bbb eee fff.\n\nI'm running a Bool Query which contains 2 should Phrase queries: aaa bbb and eee fff.\n\nI'm using an FVH with two tags <1></1> and <2></2>.\n\nIt gives the correct result: <1>aaa bbb</1> ccc ddd bbb <2>eee fff</2>\n\nWith same settings, I'm now running with 2 should Phrase queries: aaa bbb and bbb eee.\n\nI'm getting back a wrong result: <1>aaa bbb</1> ccc ddd <1>bbb eee</1> fff where I'm expecting <1>aaa bbb</1> ccc ddd <2>bbb eee</2> fff.\n\nWhy this?\n\nApparently the FVH is getting back as sequence numbers in the first case 0 and 1 but in the second case 0 and 2.\n\nThe problem is when we call then getPreTag, we are getting the first tag instead of the second one:\n\n\n  protected String getPreTag( String[] preTags, int num ){\n    int n = num % preTags.length;\n    return preTags[n];\n  }\n  \n  protected String getPostTag( String[] postTags, int num ){\n    int n = num % postTags.length;\n    return postTags[n];\n  }\n\n\n\nI did not find yet how to fix that. But I believe it is somewhere in org.apache.lucene.search.vectorhighlight.FieldQuery class\n\n\n    private void markTerminal( int slop, float boost ){\n      this.terminal = true;\n      this.slop = slop;\n      this.boost = boost;\n      this.termOrPhraseNumber = fieldQuery.nextTermOrPhraseNumber();\n    }\n\n\n\nThis call to nextTermOrPhraseNumber() increments the term number I guess because we have already seen the term BBB previously.\n\nI'm going to join a test case patch.",
