I thought that we could just turn off the other indexing options for the drill-down terms, but then the entire field gets screwed up.\n\nIf we're going to fix that, we'll need to provide index migration utilities, either on the fly or as a one op (preferably on the fly). The drill-down terms are used only for drill-down .. well in the case of associations it may not be so, but nm them for now.\n\nIf we cutover to DV, we need index migration too. So maybe we stop everything and develop some migration abilities?  ",
