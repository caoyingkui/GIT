            "content": "\n\tUpdated patch with more javadocs, logging and tests.\n\tManagedTriggers is renamed to ScheduledTriggers. The two maps inside the class are now folded into one.\n\tScheduledTriggers uses a scheduled executor thread pool with 4 core pool threads and uses a separate single threaded executor to fire the actions associated with a trigger.\n\tTriggerThread is renamed to OverseerTriggerThread\n\tThe generics used in the interfaces are now much more saner.\n\tActions specified during trigger creation are now executed but this issue doesn't implement any of them. It is likely that the TriggerAction interface and the way they are fired by ScheduledTriggers will undergo revision.\n\n\n\nThis is ready to commit, IMO. Reviews appreciated. ",
