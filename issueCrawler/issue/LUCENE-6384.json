    "description": "This method is causing bugs in tests, I think its a trap.\n\nI don't think people understand the semantics of it, and i don't like that its difficult for it to return false in tests\n\nSo its unlikely to return false in tests, only in production. Broken just like java 7 string hashing.\n\nI think we should either remove it, rename it, fix the javadocs let IndexWriter create a random and intentionally return false from this method say 1% of the time to make it less trappy, something.",
