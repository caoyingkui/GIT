The edit box is then full size, as it should be. It doesn't seem to have a big impact on anything else so maybe that was never really required.\n\nThere are likely going to be other changes required of the stylesheet, but this is the most glaring problem at the moment and prevents investigating what other issues are in the content that need to be resolved. I'll file another issue for general style changes once I figure them out. "
