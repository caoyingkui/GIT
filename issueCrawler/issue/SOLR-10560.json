    "description": "Looking at the docs for mergeindex[1][2], I don't see any equivalent operations for SolrCloud. That it, while we can merge a single index, if we have replicas we would need to merge into each one separately.\n\nIt would be useful to be able to be able to execute something like:\n/admin/collections?action=mergeindexes&collection=coll1&shard=shard1&indexDir=/tmp/updatedIndex\n\nPart of the problem with separate merges is that if one fails, the operator has to manually trigger recoveries. Doing this at the collection level would let Solr internally enforce an all-or-nothing level of success.\n\n[1]: https://wiki.apache.org/solr/MergingSolrIndexes\n[2]: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/CoreAdmin+API#CoreAdminAPI-MERGEINDEXES",
