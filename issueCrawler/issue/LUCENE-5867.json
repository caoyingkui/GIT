Like the previous patch, it does score regardless of index statistics, document length or term freq. However it does not take the index time boost into account for scoring (only query-time boost) and encodes norms the same way as BM25Similarity, ClassicSimilarity or SimilarityBase. The benefit is that it would allow to switch between the BM25, Classic or Boolean similarity after the index has been created. ",

And in the case that you do not need phrase matching, you could also index with IndexOptions.DOCS_ONLY rather than IndexOptions.DOCS_AND_FREQS since freqs are not used for scoring either. ",
