The regex now looks for whitespace after the number.  A quick test seemed to work, but I will need to do some more extensive testing. ",

Google says it's supported on OpenBSD, so it's probably also supported on all the other BSD variants.\n\nI would be interested in knowing whether there are any *nix systems where -w is not supported on the native grep, and how common those systems are.
