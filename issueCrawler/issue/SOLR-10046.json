    "description": "Create a merge policy that can detect schema changes and use UninvertingReader to uninvert fields and write docvalues into merged segments when a field has docvalues enabled.\n\nThe current behavior is to write null values in the merged segment which can lead to data integrity problems when sorting or faceting pending a full reindex. \n\nWith this patch it would still be recommended to reindex when adding docvalues for performance reasons, as it not guarenteed all segments will be merged with docvalues turned on.",
