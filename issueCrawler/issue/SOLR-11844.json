    "description": "I am using Suggest component in solr 6.5 version. I have configured BlendidInfixLookupFactory to sort suggestions based on the search keyword. \n\nBelow is my current configuration:\n\n\n    <searchComponent name=\"suggest\" class=\"solr.SuggestComponent\">\n        <lst name=\"suggester\">\n          <str name=\"name\">mySuggester</str>\n          <str name=\"lookupImpl\">BlendedInfixLookupFactory</str>\n    \t  <str name=\"dictionaryImpl\">DocumentDictionaryFactory</str>   \n          <str name=\"field\">title</str>\n    \t  <str name=\"suggestAnalyzerFieldType\">text_general</str>\n    \t  <str name=\"blenderType\">position_linear</str>\n    \t  <str name=\"numFactor\">20</str>\n    \t</lst>\n      </searchComponent>\n\n      <requestHandler name=\"/suggest\" class=\"solr.SearchHandler\" startup=\"lazy\">\n        <lst name=\"defaults\">\n          <str name=\"suggest\">true</str>\n          <str name=\"suggest.count\">10</str>\n        </lst>\n        <arr name=\"components\">\n          <str>suggest</str>\n        </arr>\n      </requestHandler> \n\nBut it is not sorting based on the position of keyword and it is returning in random order and not sure what order is being followed. As per solr documentation, it should sort based on the position, but it is not working in that order. \n\nFor Example: My search keyword is blue,\nMy Expected results: blue, blue whale, blue water, sky blue\nActual results: sky blue, blue whale, blue water, blue",
