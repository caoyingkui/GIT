    "description": "The fix revision 698487 was aimed to remove an NPE bug (LUCENE-1404) on the returned value  of  \"min()\" in the method \"isPayloadAvailable\" of the file \"/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/spans/NearSpansUnordered.java\" , but it is incomplete. \n\nSince the  returned value  \"min()\" could be null during the runtime execution, its value should also be null-checked before being dereferenced in other methods. \n\nThe buggy code locations the same fix needs to be applied at are as bellows: \n\nLines 159 , 170 , and 196 of the methods \"next()\" \nLine 216 of the methods \"skipTo()\"\nLine 230 of the methods \"doc()\"\n230  public int doc() \n{ return min().doc(); }\n\nLine 232 of the methods \"start()\"\n232  public int start() \n{ return min().start(); }\n\nLine 315 of the methods \"atMatch()\"\n\tprivate boolean atMatch() \n{\n315    return (min().doc() == max.doc())\n\t        && ((max.end() - min().start() - totalLength) <= slop);\n\t  }",
