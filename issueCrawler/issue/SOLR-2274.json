Here's the problem: when the core\nfails while being loaded (in this case because the core configuration\nwas bogus) it left the index/ directory locked. It did not flush out\nthe new empty index (just the segment* files).\n\nSo, if a core has no index, and fails during loading, it should either\nwrite out an empty index as it intended to, or remove the half-built\ndata/index/ directory. Or just not make the empty index until loading\ncompletes?",
