I do see errors in the network console that three *.min.js.map files are 404; this is an Angular source code thing that can be ignored though?\n\nNot seeing any other errors in the loading of the page, though if I do try to select something from the narrow drop-down and analyze a string, I get this error: \n\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'join' of null\n    at getShortComponentName (analysis.js:74)\n    at mangle (analysis.js:119)\n    at processAnalysisData (analysis.js:133)\n    at analysis.js:163\n    at angular-resource.min.js:32\n    at processQueue (angular.js:13193)\n    at angular.js:13209\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$eval (angular.js:14406)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$digest (angular.js:14222)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$apply (angular.js:14511)\n\n ",

Hopefully it is something in there that is causing this.\n\nSecondly, could you set a breakpoint at line 37 of js/angular/controllers/analysis.js, and see what happens there? At that point, it has received the data from the back-end, and is joining the field names and field types into a single array \"fieldsAndTypes\" which are then used to populate your (empty) dropdown. I suspect something will be obvious in there.\n\nThx!\n ",

            "content": "Both parts resolved, I hope.\n\nFirstly, the 'chosen' library was making the drop down too narrow, for reasons I did not fathom. I took the hacky approach of fixing the width to 130px. Less than perfect, but better than what was there.\n\nSecondly, I added code to store the analysis parameters in the URL some time after implementing the analysis tab initially. What I didn't fully appreciate is the fact that Angular re-renders the view (rerunning the controller) once you change the URL. This meant that a heap of parameters were set correctly, then the view would reload without them. Some reasonable moving about should have resolved this. When the user clicks the \"analyse\" tab, all that happens is the URL is rewritten. Then, when Angular reloads the view, the view initialisation causes the actual analysis work to happen. ",
