            "content": "the first thing i thought when reading the description of this issue was that it seemed like a strnage bastardization of the StopFilter class ... looking at the patch i see it's not even implemented in the StopFilter - it's a new \"GoFilter\" class which makes me feel a lot better.\n\nI'd rather see a new \"GoFilterFactory\" class be added then to have a conditional switch in StopFilterFactory ... people skimming a schema may not notice a requireWord boolean on a StopFilterFactory declaration that completely reverses the meaning of the declaration ... it would be better to make it more obvious.
