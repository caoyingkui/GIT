    "description": "Due to investigations on my part in looking into a possible misbehaviour (or\nmisunderstanding of the correct behaviour) of the filter cache this commit\nadds in the ability to assert that the form of items presented to solr caches\nare valid and expected.\n\nThe interface for this is known as a CacheGuarantor, by default this interface\nresolves a NoOp implementation that does nothing (and should be nicely\neliminated by the JIT as dead code).\n\nFor the filterCache a basic (and potentially incorrect) guarantor is setup\nthat demands all keys presented to the filter cache are FilterQueries.\n\nThis currently makes function queries fail unit tests, which may (or may\nnot !) be a bug (and I am guessing probably not here since I am clearly missing some deeper truth)\n\nI tend to work off github so the patch is also on the tip of this branch https://github.com/GregBowyer/lucene-solr/commits/cache-guarantors",
