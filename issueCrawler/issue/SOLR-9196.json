There are many cases where the content in the old wiki is completely replaced/superseded by the current Solr Ref Guide, and those can just be updated without a lot of additional discussion. It would be nice if we could do a band-aid style migration of everything, but at this point the reality is that no one is volunteering to do that so there's no point in waiting. ",
