But this was discussed in the mailing list and the community thinks it's better to give it some more time for the API's on the new QP to get stable and allow more time for review of the new queryparser.\n\nI think there is an understanding to move the new QueryParser to core, when 3.1 is released.\n\nWhen the new messages and the queryparser is moved to core, it will be more usable.  If we keep it on contrib, in my opinion we should leave it as is for release 2.9 and 3.0\n\nWe should re-look at this issue when 3.0 is done, by moving message and the queryparser to core.\n ",
