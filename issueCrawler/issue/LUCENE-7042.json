    "description": "Followup of LUCENE-7039.\n\nI started consolidating encode/decode functions into XYZField, but its still pretty messy. Specifically, duplicated code because indexer wants packed byte[] and queries want byte[][] and so on.\n\nWe can do a bit more cleanup: by defining everything in terms of encodeDimension() and decodeDimension(). This way, the logic is only in one place. \n\nAlso the new NumericUtils methods here are confusing I think. Its scary how they take a \"dimensional index\" when parsing from a byte[]. I think they should just take 'offset' and not try to be fancy, its easier to understand.",
