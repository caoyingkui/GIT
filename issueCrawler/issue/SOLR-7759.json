    "description": "Currently when we use debugQuery to see the explanation of the matched documents, the query fired to get the statistics for the matched documents is not a distributed query.\n\nThis is a problem when using distributed idf. The actual documents are being scored using the global stats and not per shard stats , but the explain will show us the score by taking into account the stats from the shard where the document belongs to.\n\nWe should try to implement the explain query as a distributed request so that the scores match the actual document scores.",
