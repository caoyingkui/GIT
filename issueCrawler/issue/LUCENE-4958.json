    "description": "In DocFieldProcessor, on line 353, there is this assert:\n\n      assert docValuesConsumerAndDocID.docID < docState.docID;\n\nIs this assert necessary? I don't see in the indexing pipeline that this guarantee is needed. Can we remove this?\n\nWe have implemented a custom indexingchain that rewrites docState.docID is reverse order and it is working well. But we have to do ugly workarounds in our test to avoid this assert.",
