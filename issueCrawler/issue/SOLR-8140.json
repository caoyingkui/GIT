I haven't yet seen any clear use-cases documented to give me any real idea of how it would be used.\n\nI didn't see a clear issue tracking this, so i'm openeing one to discuss the merits of the feature and track implementing if (if that's the final decision)",

The primary usecase i remember was for linking to \"custom admin screens\" generated from Velocity templates (ie: to create a custom search page with specific fields corrisponding to the usecase)\n ",

Menus extras were a bit better, but also did not integrate in any meaningful way. All of this also caused continuous log message issues, polluted access log, and so on. \n\nI am going ahead with removing admin-extra from Angular UI. I would welcome a new ticket with a discussion of a concrete use case to implement this better later.  ",
