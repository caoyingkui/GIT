    "description": "Hello everybody,\n\nI am using SolrJ and I would really appreaciate if there was an annotation that maps the localizable fields in a map of <Locale, String>. Just like this:\n\n\npublic class Product {\n\n    @LocaleField\n    private Map<Locale, String> name;\n}\n\n\n\ninstead of \n\n\npublic class Product {\n    @Field\n    private String name_en;\n\n    @Field\n    private String name_fr;\n    \n    @Field\n    private String name_de;\n\n    //etc\n}",
