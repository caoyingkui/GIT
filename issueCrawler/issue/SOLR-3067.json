    "description": "If you add &group=on&group.field=inStock to the URL in the /browse requesthandler, it throws a 500 error, due to a missing hitGrouped.vm file. \n\nThis works correctly in trunk. Copying hitGrouped.vm from 4.0 to 3.5 prevents the error, although some of the other grouping support still isn't present.\n\nOne could just remove the #parse(hitGrouped.vm) from browse.vm, and avoid the error, but it's probably about as easy to backport it.",
