    "description": "The bundled Guava 14.0.1 JAR blocks deploying Solr 4.4 in Glassfish 4.x.\n\nThis failure is a known issue with upstream Guava and is described here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1433\n\nBuilding Guava guava-15.0-SNAPSHOT.jar from master and bundling it in Solr allows for a successful deployment.\n\nUntil the Guava developers release version 15 using their HEAD or even an RC tag seems like the only way to resolve this.\n\nThis is frustrating since it was proposed that Guava be removed as a dependency before Solr 4.0 was released and yet it remains and blocks upgrading: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3601",

This is one reason why Solr may no longer be a WAR in the future. Solr is a separate s erver like mysql and should run in an isolated process.  "
