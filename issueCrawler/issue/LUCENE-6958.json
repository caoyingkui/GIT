    "description": "Currently CustomAnalyzer only allows to specify the SPI names of factories. As the fluent builder pattern is mostly used inside Java code, it is better for type safety to optionally also specify the factory class directly (using compile-time safe patterns like .withTokenizer(WhitespaceTokenizerFactory.class)). With the string names, you get the error only at runtime. Of course this does not help with wrong, spelled parameter names, but it also has the side effect that you can click on the class name in your code to get javadocs with the parameter names.\n\nThis issue will add this functionality and update the docs/example.\n\nThanks to Shai Erera for suggesting this!",

Do you think we should delegate all the variants now to a private e.g. withTokenizer(TokenizerFactory) which will also set components added, call applyResourceLoader etc.?\n\nAlso, should you mention it in CHANGES?\n\nOtherwise, +1 to commit and thanks for taking care of this so quickly!

It is only one method call and the boolean flag change. If we have further refactoring this would make sense, but now it adds 3 methods for nothing (and makes it unreadable). "
