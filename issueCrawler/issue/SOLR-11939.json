But this is still a discrepancy between the docs and the API. I've spent\u00a0an hour figuring this out, patching\u00a0a Chef's cookbook adding these properties and figured out that this doesn't work as described in the docs.\u00a0 ",

            "content": "Hi\u00a0Alexander ,\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen you say there is\u00a0discrepancy b/w the docs and the API which docs are you referring to? Anything from http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/\u00a0?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn general since you are creating a 4 shard collection , internally the collections api will creates 1 replica per shard which internally is a core . \"property.name\" won't work since you can't pass all 4 names.\n\nPerhaps if you use the add-replica command ( http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide//collections-api.html#addreplica\u00a0)\u00a0 you could specify the name but in general it's best if you let Solr pick a generic name.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo unless you find anywhere in the solr ref guide that confused you to believe that you need to specify \"property.name\" I'd like to close out the Jira.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 ",

See the section\u00a0Defining core.properties\u00a0for details on supported properties and values.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll shards and replicas are created on separate Solr instances so a single name for all cores would work in this case.\n\nWell, I started working on core names mostly because the WEB UI (at least in 5.3.1) doesn't work with collections so I wasn't aware that query requests would work with collection\u00a0names also. Core name doesn't matter that much then and we're fine with generic core names.\n\nIt would be good to mention this in the docs somewhere.\n\nBest,\n\nAlexander S. ",
