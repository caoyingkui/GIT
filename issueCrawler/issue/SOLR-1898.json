    "description": "Recently indexing some data where I had mismatched types going in (schema was an int, I was sending in a float) and got:\n\nApr 30, 2010 3:48:46 PM org.apache.solr.common.SolrException log\nSEVERE: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"0.0\"\n        at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:48)\n        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:458)\n        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:499)\n        at org.apache.solr.schema.TrieField.createField(TrieField.java:426)\n\n\n\nI think our indexing exception handling needs to add at least two things (we also need per document handling of errors during batch, but that is covered by SOLR-445, see also SOLR-482)\n1. If there was an error creating the field, the exception should specify what the field name is.\n2. All document exceptions should, if there is a unique key, report the unique key of the document that failed.",
