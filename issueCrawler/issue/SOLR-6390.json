The javadoc update made me remember just how incomplete the javadocs for CloudSolrServer constructors are, and I would recommend using the javadocs I created on SOLR-5852.  Look at the latest patch on that issue, from 23/Jul/14.  That one never got committed, and probably needs to be closed.\n\nDo you want to make a new patch, or leave it for me? "
