    "description": "Hi\n\nIs there any way I can set the Tokenizer to Keyword Tokenizer instead of StandardTokenizer by default for all known fields as well as unknown fileds ( In schema less mode ).\u00a0 Basically I don't want Solr to break the terms I index into multiple terms. It also affects faceting. when I try to facet on a term CPU in an example Data Set ( CPU=\"Quad 2 Core\" , CPU=Intel I3 ) , i get 5 facets ( Quad , 2, Core , Intel and I3 ) which is not the behavior I'm expecting. I'm expecting only 2 facets.\n\nCan it be made configurable too. For example can a user define the Analyzers for all the unknown fields through a wildcard syntax or something\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks\n\nZyan",
