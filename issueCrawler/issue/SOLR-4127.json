    "description": "The atomic update feature described in SOLR-139 seems to depend on having an <updateLog /> configured in solrconfig.xml.\n\nWhen used without an update log, the update commands like set or add don't result in an error and the transaction being aborted, but produce garbled documents instead. This is the case for both the XML and JSON formats for the update message.\n\nExample:\n\nI initially created some content like this:\n\n\n$ curl 'localhost:8983/solr/update?commit=true' -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '\n[{\"id\":\"7cb8a43c\",\"Title\":\"My original Title\", \"Creator\": \"John Doe\"}]'\n\n\n\nWhich resulted in this document:\n\n\n<doc>\n    <str name=\"id\">7cb8a43c</str>\n    <str name=\"Title\">My original Title</str>\n    <str name=\"Creator\">John Doe</str>\n</doc>\n\n\n\nThen I attempted to update that document with this statement:\n\n\n$ curl 'localhost:8983/solr/update?commit=true' -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '\n[{\"id\":\"7cb8a43c\",\"Title\":{\"set\":\"My new title\"}}]'\n\n\n\nWhich resulted in this garbled document, with the fields that weren't updated missing:\n\n\n<doc>\n    <str name=\"id\">7cb8a43c</str>\n    <str name=\"Title\">{set=My new title}</str>\n</doc>",
