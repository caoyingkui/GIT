    "description": "Tokenizers/Filters can now produce graphs instead of a single linear\nchain of tokens, by setting the PositionLengthAttribute, expressing\nwhere (how many positions ahead) this token \"ends\".\n\nThe default is 1, meaning it ends at the next position, to be\nbackwards compatible.\n\nSynonymFilter produces graph output tokens, as long as the output is a\nsingle token, but currently never sets the pos length to express this.\nEG for the rule \"wifi network -> hotspot\", the hotspot token should\nhave pos length = 2.  With LUCENE-3940 this will allow us to verify\nthat the offsets for such tokens are correct...",
