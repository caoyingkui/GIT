    "description": "A recent mailing list thread brought up a common point of confusion: it's difficult for new users to tell what URL/path should be given as the solrServerUrl SolrClient param.\n\nCurrently, the top-level HttpSolrClient Javadocs explain this.  But none of the other SolrClient implementations provide any guidance to unfamiliar users.\n\nWe should add consistent documentation for this parameter to each of the SolrClient implementations.",

Thanks for the reminder to make use of the checked-in-documentation!\n\nAs a side note, the \"Using SolrJ\" page probably needs a little attention in general.  It has a lot of references which are are a bit out of date (it's missing LBHttpSolrClient and ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient from its list of implementations, it refers to the classes at several points as \"SolrServer\" instead of the \"SolrClient\", etc.)  But in the interest of making the patch easy to review, I'll create a separate JIRA for those proposed doc changes.
