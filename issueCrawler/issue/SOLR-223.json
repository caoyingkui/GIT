    "description": "as recently mentioned on the mailing list, when using SolrQueryParser a simple term query will fail if the field name used is not a valid field according to the schema (because it consults the IndexSchema to get the Analyzer) \u2013 but a wildcard, fuzzy, or prefix query will not trigger such an error (because no analysis is done)\n\nwe should make SolrQueryParser more aware of these types of errors.\n\nwe should probably also make it more aware of when fields aren't indexed, attempting to query on them should be an error as well.",
