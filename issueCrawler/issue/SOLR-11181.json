For example:\n\nPUT /<path>/org/apache/lucene/lucene-core/<version>/lucene-core-4.10.4-fs.31-sources.jar \nPUT /<path>/org/apache/lucene/lucene-core/<version>/lucene-core-4.10.4-fs.31-sources.jar.sha1 \nPUT /<path>/org/apache/lucene/lucene-core/<version>/lucene-core-4.10.4-fs.31-sources.jar.md5\n...\nPUT /<path>/org/apache/lucene/lucene-core/<version>/lucene-core-4.10.4-fs.31-sources.jar \n...\n\nThe maven repo I am using does not allow the second PUT and, hence, the build fails.",

I'm not sure how to deal with this problem, since the project we use to upload artifacts (Maven Ant Tasks) has been discontinued, and the likely alternative (Aether Ant Tasks) has also been discontinued.  I'm guessing we'll have to switch to Ivy for artifact upload in order to address this issue.  This likely will not be a small task.

Both these targets are run by Jenkins via the jenkins-maven-nightly target.\n\nThe problem is that validate-maven-dependencies first removes all Lucene/Solr artifacts from the local Maven repository, and then attempts to resolve each artifact's dependencies from the local repository by disabling remote resolution.  Apparently because of the re-ordering of the artifact:deploy and artifact:install tasks (as a result of your patch), (some?) depended-on artifacts are no longer populated in the local repository.\n\nSince validate-maven-dependencies needs only artifact:install, and not artifact:deploy, I'm thinking we could add an m2-install macro to be used instead.  I'm not yet sure how m2-deploy is called via validate-maven-dependencies though.\n\nAnything I can do to help?\n\nIf you're up for it, you could a) investigate whether generate-maven-artifacts currently does any local repository installation (if not, that's a problem); and/or b) look into the feasibility of, and possibly implement, my above m2-install idea.
