    "description": "Imagine a one-field yellow page search using eDisMax across fields\n\nqf=firstname middlename lastname companyname category^10.0 subcategory products address street zip city^5.0 state\n\n\n\nNow this of course works well. But what if I want to offer my users fielded search on \"who\", \"what\" and \"where\".\nA way to do this now is copyField into three new fields with these names. But then you lose the internal weight between the sub fields.\nA more elegant way would be allowing virtual field names mapping to multiple fields, so user can search where:london and match address, street, zip, city or state automatically.",
