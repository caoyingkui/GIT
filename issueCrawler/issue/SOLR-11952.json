    "description": "The current olsRegress\u00a0function works on an in-memory matrix. It would be nice to also have an online updating multivariate regression implementation that works with data sets of any size.\n\nThis ticket will add support for Miller Updating Regression, which can be used with data sets of any size. An OnlineRegressionStream\u00a0Stream Decorator will be added to support this functionality. The function name will likely be called onlineRegress.\n\nThe implementation will be provided by Apache Commons Math.",
