            "content": "Quoting my suggestion from SOLR-10574. Guess this could be done both with \"simple\" and \"edismax\" parsers, but thought \"simple\" was \u2013 eh ... simpler  :\n\nLet's consider an ability for the ootb default configsets to auto search all fields if neither df or qf are specified. A potential fast-track solution is to extend SimpleQParserPlugin to interpret qf=* as a catch-all mode where it simply iterates all indexed fields in schema and searches across these. We could then add to our /select and /query handlers in the default config sets: defType=simple&qf=*...\n\nTo make this less intrusive the catch-all mode could be triggered only if qf=* is explicitly configured, something we could enable by default in the data driven config sets. Then it is easy to turn it off my editing qf and df in the request handlers. ",
