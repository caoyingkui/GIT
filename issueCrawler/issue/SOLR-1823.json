            "content": "Nice catch Frank.\n\nFWIW: the original intent was that any of those types of objects could be used as the value of a Map, not the key \u2013 but that's still no excuse to just cast the key instead of using stringification (i could have sworn it was already doing that)\n\nThe one subtlety that your patch broke however is that if someone uses null as a key in the Map, that has always been written out as an entry w/o a key \u2013 but by using String.valueOf your patch allways produces a non-null string value (ie: the 4 character string \"null\") so i modified your patch to just use toString() with an explicit null check.\n\nCommitted revision 925031.
