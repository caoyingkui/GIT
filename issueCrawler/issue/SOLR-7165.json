    "description": "It seems that when creating a collection to HDFS with the \" bin/solr create -c \" command, the authentication is always simple, even with\n\n<bool name=\"solr.hdfs.security.kerberos.enabled\">true</bool>\n<str name=\"solr.hdfs.security.kerberos.keytabfile\">key.tab</str>\n<str name=\"solr.hdfs.security.kerberos.principal\">principal</str>\n\nI have two Hadoop clusters, one with simple auth and one kerberized. I can correctly add a collection to the first one. I duplicated the solrconfig.xml, added the kerberos parameters and I can't add a collection to the second one. Here's the bin/solr log:\n\nbin/solr create -c collectionsecurehdfs -d Solr/collection1/\n\nSetup new core instance directory:\nSolr/server/solr/collectionsecurehdfs\n\nCreating new core 'collectionsecurehdfs' using command:\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=collectionsecurehdfs&instanceDir=collectionsecurehdfs\n\nFailed to create core 'collectionsecurehdfs' due to: Error CREATEing SolrCore 'collectionsecurehdfs': Unable to create core [collectionsecurehdfs] Caused by: hadoop.security.authentication set to: simple, not kerberos, but attempting to  connect to HDFS via kerberos.",
