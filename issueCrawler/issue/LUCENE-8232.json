I think if we do, there should be two implementations so that we know the api is correct.\n\na couple of things, I think it's good to have a second impl. There is one in the a test but I am happy to remove the interface here and make it a concrete class. The refactoring and cleaning up in ReadersAndUpdates is good I think. We can then handle and discuss if we want this abstraction in a separate issue. ok with this Robert Muir? ",

From what i saw in the first patch it didn't seem really worked out.\n\nFor example there is a protected method in indexwriter referring to a pkg-private class, i would expect javadocs linter to fail there. So for this new protected method to work correctly it'd probably require ReadersAndUpdates stuff to become a publicly visible class, too.\n ",
