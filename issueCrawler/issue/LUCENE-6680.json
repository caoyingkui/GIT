    "description": "I expect the following test to pass, but it's failing in the latest Lucene 5.2.1: \n\nFailingTest.java\npublic void testBlendedInfixSuggesterDedupsOnWeightTitleAndPayload() throws Exception {\n\n//Only the payload is different\n    Input[] inputDocuments = new Input[]{\n        new Input(\"lend me your ear\", 7, new BytesRef(\"uid1\")),\n        new Input(\"lend me your ear\", 7, new BytesRef(\"uid2\")),\n    };\n\n    Analyzer a = new MockAnalyzer(random(), MockTokenizer.WHITESPACE, false);\n    BlendedInfixSuggester suggester = new BlendedInfixSuggester(newDirectory(), a, a, AnalyzingInfixSuggester.DEFAULT_MIN_PREFIX_CHARS,\n        BlendedInfixSuggester.BlenderType.POSITION_RECIPROCAL, 10, false);\n\n    InputArrayIterator inputArrayIterator = new InputArrayIterator(inputDocuments);\n    suggester.build(inputArrayIterator);\n\n    List<Lookup.LookupResult> results = suggester.lookup(TestUtil.stringToCharSequence(\"ear\", random()), 10, true, true);\n\n    suggester.close();\n    a.close();\n\n    assertEquals(2, results.size());\n\n  }\n\n\n\n\nThis test is failing because the BlendedInfixSuggester internally uses a TreeSet for storing the results and the corresponding Comparator only uses text+weight meaning that results with different payloads are collapsed into one.\n\nMichael McCandless, The idea here is that if two ingested documents have the same title and weight, but different payloads, then they are two different things and folding them into a single document would mean loosing the payload information.",
