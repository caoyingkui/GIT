(other characters have the same affect as commas)\n\n=========\n\n\n2.\n---------\n\nFor a document with phone numbers:\n2124225100\n212 422 5100\n212-422-5100\n(212) 422-5100\n(212)4225100\n(212)422-5100\n(212) 422.5100\n(212) 422 5100\n212.422.5100\n212.422-5100\n\n\n2.a\nIf I do a search:\n212*422*5100~0.9\n\nMultiPhraseQueryParser.parse(term) returns a query for:\ncontent:\"(212.422-5100 212-422-5100 2124225100 212.422.5100)\"\n\nI do not get a match on 212)422-5100 \u2013 Doesn't find anything that starts with (212)...\n\n\n2.b\nSearch term:\n212*422*5100\n\nMultiPhraseQueryParser.parse(term) returns a query for:\ncontent:212*422*5100\n\nand does not match 212)422-5100 \u2013 Doesn't find anything that starts with (212)...\n\n\n2.c\nIf I try to work around that by searching with proximity for:\n\"212 422*5100\"~1\n\nMultiPhraseQueryParser.parse(term) returns a query for:\ncontent:\"(422-5100 422.5100 4225100)\"~1\n\nand again does not find anything with (212)... like (212) 422-5100 or (212)422-5100\n=========",
