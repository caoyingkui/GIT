            "content": "Patch, moves *solrtest* from server/etc/ to server/etc/test/ - this directory and its contents are excluded when building the binary .tgz and .zip packages.\n\nIn the patch I also removed the commented-out SSL configuration in server/etc/jetty.xml, which referred to solrtest.keystore - Shalin Shekhar Mangar told me offline that under Jetty 9 this will no longer be used: HTTPS and SSL config is done in other files.  I've already removed the solrtest.keystore references in this file on branch_5x and lucene_solr_5_0, so this part of the patch won't get backported to those branches.\n\nCommitting shortly. ",
