I seem to be\ngetting the same results he is, which is certianly.  see attached test case.\n\nwhile this definitely seems like a bug, it also seems like a fairly\ninefficinent way of approaching hte problem in general, instead of:\n  BooleanQuery containing:\n    a) FilteredQuery wrapping:\n        Query for \"all\" \u2013 filtered by \u2013 RangeFilter #1\n    b) FilteredQuery wrapping:\n        Query for \"all\" \u2013 filtered by \u2013 RangeFilter #2\n\n...it seems like it would make more sense to use...\n\n  FilterQuery wrapping:\n    Query for all \u2013 filtered by \u2013 ChainedFilter containing:\n      a) RangeFilter #1\n      b) RangeFilter #2\n\n-------------------------------\n\nI'll attach the testcase momentarily",
