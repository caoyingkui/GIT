Maybe its an svn prop?\nMaybe something needs to be specified to the tar/zip process?\nCurrently the 'source release' is really an svn export...\n\nPersonally i always do 'sh foo.sh' rather than './foo.sh',\nbut if it makes it more user-friendly we should figure it out\n\nJust opening the issue since we don't forget about it, I think solr cloud\nadds some more shell scripts so we should at least figure out what we want to do.",

Unfortunately there is no portable way to store these permissions. Ant uses the algorithm used by Info-Zip's implementation of the zip and unzip commands - these are the default versions of zip and unzip for many Unix and Unix-like systems.\n\nI remember we used to ZIP with unix permissions and they unzipped just fine (with permission sets).

            "content": "Yes, it also works for ZIP.\n\nI checked Solr's build.xml: It already does what I propose (haveing several tarfilesets and zipfilesets). But it looks like it only sets mode to 755 for example/**.sh, not globally.\n\nSo the fix is to extend that to include all .sh files (just change some properties).\n\nI checked both that TGZ and ZIP files for 3.x, too - they have (partly) incorrect attributes (binary tgz is correct, it has +x on example post.sh), so something is wrong with the src filesets (I think they are outdated as they dont respect the root). The files in scripts have no *.sh extension but are still shell scripts. Those have no 755, too.\n\nI will look into this and provide patch fro trunk. 3.x is too late. "
