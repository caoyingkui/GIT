    "description": "Now that replication has some better tests and bugs fixed, we may be able to stop forcing a replication on every replication call and let the snap pull determine if one is actually needed. This never worked quite right in the past, so I got around it by forcing a replication on recovery whether it was needed or not - the peer sync phase made this not the biggest deal. However, there are cases where it would still be useful - see SOLR-4519.",
