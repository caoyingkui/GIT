            "content": "To make it clear, this issue is about recommending (not executing) possible optimizations to the cluster. This is different that what triggers do, which is to detect and execute (control) actions to keep cluster parameters to fit within configured bounds.\n\nTrend detection is a complex topic in general so we probably should not work any any sophisticated solutions in Solr for this - we have the metrics history API (SOLR-11779) so that external tools can analyze this data and implement their own rules and trend detection, and decide on possible optimizations (eg. \"add more replicas on Fridays\").\n\nSolr may provide only some basic trend detection, eg. linear regression for detecting monotonic trends, and Fourier transform for detecting cyclic trends.
