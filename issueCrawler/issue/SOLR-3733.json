            "content": "I agree that a cleanup is in order, but i'm torn on whether it makes sense for Solr to get rid of the \"all javadocs\" directory like we did for lucene-core.\n\nThe key issue in my mind is that most Solr users aren't java devs/users, but the majority of documentation about what \"plugins\" are available in solr OOTB comes from the javadoc \"known subclasses\" information.  So while individual javadoc dirs for solr-core/solrj/contribs/test-framework are nice because they make it really clear what features available in each individual jar, having hte \"all javadocs\" directory gives us URLs for each type of \"plugin\" that we can point people to that not only give a basic summary of what that plugin type is used for, but also get a simple list of the implementations available in the entire solr distribution, regardless of what contrib it's in...\n\n\n\thttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/api-4_0_0-BETA/org/apache/solr/update/processor/UpdateRequestProcessorFactory.html\n\thttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/api-4_0_0-BETA/org/apache/solr/handler/component/SearchComponent.html\n\thttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/api-4_0_0-BETA/org/apache/solr/response/QueryResponseWriter.html\n\thttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/api-4_0_0-BETA/org/apache/solr/schema/FieldType.html\n\tetc...\n\n\n\nIn any case ... i just wanted to bring it up for consideration.  Not sure if anyone else has an opinion. "
