            "content": "Just throwing an exception is not very elegant. We could mask the exception and return empty list without further notice but that would render the API inconsistent. Here are two options:\nA) Fail the whole request with temporary error code (e.g. 503 Service Unavailable)\nB) Fail only the request for this dictionary, returning empty list and an error code (SuggesterResult)\n\nI'm tempted to suggest A here for the sake of simplicity. If requesting multiple dictionaries in one request, you'll not get a response before all dictionaries are available and working. ",

            "content": "This may not be as severe as I first thought, as the JSON response is well formed, containing an error element and no msg node explaining why. A more direct handling of the situation where fst==null with a proper msg code would be good. Perhaps also SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE is better than the current 500 server error. ",
