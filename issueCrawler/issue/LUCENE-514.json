I think what is needed is something like this:\n\n  public List getTerms() {\n    List nestedList = new ArrayList();\n    for (Iterator iter = termArrays.iterator(); iter.hasNext() \n{\n      Term[] terms = (Term[]) iter.next();\n      nestedList.add(Arrays.asList(terms));\n    }\n    return Collections.unmodifiableList(nestedList);\n  } ",
