    "description": "I added query time join domain changes to json faceting in SOLR-10583 - but didn't document it in the ref guide since json faceting iddn't exist in the ref guide at all\n\nwe now have json faceting in the ref guide, but there isn't really a cohesive section explaining domain changes - so it's still not trivial to add this feature.\n\nin general we should take responsibility for beefing up the docs on domain changes, including the block join domain features (to parents & to children) as well as this query domain change i added",
