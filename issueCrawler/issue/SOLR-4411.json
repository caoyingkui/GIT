    "description": "The parameter facet.mincount provides a good way of filtering counts less than a given number in a faceted query. facet.maxcount would be the upper bound counterpart for this. Currently I'm doing this inside FacetComponent,by filtering the facet counts explicitly, but this is expensive. I would like to know the challenges in implementing this feature both in sharded/non-sharded environments. Willing to implement the feature with tests. \n   On first pass, it looks like I need to change the facet count algos for termenum, fieldcache, uninverted as well as DistribFieldFacet.",
