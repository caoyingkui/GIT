    "description": "filter queries are not properly filtering results when using a join query in solr4\n\nTo replicate, use the attached patch file which contains a test method that will fail (but should pass).\n\nOR\n\nrun the solr example:\n\ncd solr\nant example\njava -jar start.jar\ncd exampledocs\njava -jar post.jar *.xml\n\nThen try a few of the sample queries on the wiki page http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Join.  In particular, this is illustrates the issue:\n\nFind all manufacturer docs named \"belkin\", then join them against (product) docs and filter that list to only products with a price less than 12 dollars\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=\n{!join+from=id+to=manu_id_s}\ncompName_s:Belkin&fq=price:%5B%2A+TO+12%5D\n\nWhen you run that query, you will get two results, one with a price of 19.95 and another with a price of 11.5  Because of the filter query, I'm only expecting to see one result - the one with a price of 11.99.\n\nI was able to track this down to a change in revision #1188624 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1188624 : LUCENE-1536: Filters can now be applied down-low, if their DocIdSet implements a new bits() method, returning all documents in a random access way).  Prior to that revision (i.e. 1188613 and before) the test method will pass and the example will work as expected.",
