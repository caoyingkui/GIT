I don't have time to work on it now...\n\nWe have a number of sources that are generated (eg using tools like JFlex, JavaCC.\n\nI think we should strive to have the nightly build recreate these files, if possible.  This would help us catch mistakes more quickly, eg where we accidentally make a fix to the generated file.\n\nWe'd have to get jflex/javacc/etc. installed onto lucene.zones to do this (not sure if they are already).",
