    "description": "In SOLR-7681 we discovered that methods other than GET will work for Solr HTTP requests. However, in HttpSolrCall we assume that only a GET method is possible when returning an error message.\n\nLooking into the specific usage, I don't think this assumption is dangerous, but it would be nice to extract the actual method and use that instead.\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/servlet/HttpSolrCall.java#L621",
