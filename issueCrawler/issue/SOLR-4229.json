    "description": "the new tag \"swappable\", introduced in SOLR-1028 is too easily confused with swapping cores. Rename to \"dynamic\"? \"transient\"? I think \"transient\" captures the notion best.\n\nMarking \"blocker\" just because I want to insure it's changed before the whole notion is released the first time, patch real soon now. I think we can justify changing the names of things like this more easily before it's in \"official\" circulation.",
