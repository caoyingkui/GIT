It should be <<Example Manual Collection Creation with a Configured Policy>>. But I would argue that the correct section title is a bit long...the way you have it in the link to the section might really be a better title for the section (so, I'm suggesting to change the name of the section instead of fixing the link to it).\n\tI think you might want to read it over one more time before committing. There are several sentences that run a bit long, particularly the opening paragraph of the first section and the first sub-bullet. These make the meaning a bit harder to follow easily.\n\tAlso, you have a single top-level bullet with two sub-bullets. If you don't have a 2nd top-level bullet, you can probably just get rid of the one you have, integrate it with the hanging sentence fragment above it, and make the 2 sub-bullets top-level bullets.\n\n ",
