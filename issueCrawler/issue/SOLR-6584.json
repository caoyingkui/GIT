    "description": "When there are very few documents in the index the ExportQParserPlugin is creating a dummy docList which is larger then the number of documents in the index. This causes a bug during the prefetch stage of the QueryComponent.\n\nThere really needs to be two fixes here.\n\n1) The dummy docList should never be larger then the number of documents in the index.\n\n2) Prefetch should be turned off during exports as it's not doing anything useful.",

            "content": "Patch that ensures that the doclist will never be larger then the number of docs in the index.\n\nActually turning off prefetch will involve adding new parameters to Solr. The dummy doclist will be cached in the document cache after the first run anyway so the pre-fetch will have very little impact on performance. So I think it can remain for now. ",
