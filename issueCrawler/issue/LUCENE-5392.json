Currently it just points them at the package documentation for more details:\n\n+\n+## Removed Reader from Tokenizer constructor (LUCENE-5388)\n+\n+The constructor of Tokenizer no longer takes Reader, as this was a leftover\n+from before it was reusable. See the org.apache.lucene.analysis package\n+documentation for more details.\n\n\n\nI'm running full documentation-lint checks now, when it passes ill commit. Thanks Benson! ",
