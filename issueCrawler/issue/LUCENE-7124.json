    "description": "Followup from LUCENE-7123:\n\nLatitude/longitude values are encoded by GeoPointField/LatLonPoint with 1E-6 or 1E-7 error. \n\nHowever, the sloppy distance formula is far too accurate to the actual (10nm), making it slower and relying on large tables. We should only do as good as we need, and especially try to reduce the huge tables.",
