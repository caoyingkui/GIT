    "description": "Relevant Search demystifies relevance work and shows you that a search engine is a programmable relevance framework. You'll learn how to apply Elasticsearch or Solr to your business's unique ranking problems. The book demonstrates how to program relevance and how to incorporate secondary data sources, taxonomies, text analytics, and personalization. By the end, you\u2019ll be able to achieve a virtuous cycle of provable, measurable relevance improvements over a search product\u2019s lifetime.\n\n*Here is the link to the book on our website: https://www.manning.com/books/relevant-search",

Yes or no does not affect whether the book is listed, I just know that sometimes publishers do this kind of offers. ",
