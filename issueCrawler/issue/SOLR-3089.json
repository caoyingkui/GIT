    "description": "Hi,\n\ni have posted this issue on a mailing list but i didn't get any response.\n\nI am trying to write distributed search component (a class that extends SearchComponent). I have checked FacetComponent and TermsComponent. If I want that search component works in a distributed environment I have to set ResponseBuilder's isDistrib to true, like this (this is also done in TermsComponent for example):\n\n\tpublic void prepare(ResponseBuilder rb) throws IOException {\n\t\tSolrParams params = rb.req.getParams();\n\t\tString shards = params.get(ShardParams.SHARDS);\n\t\tif (shards != null) \n{\n\t\t\tList<String> lst = StrUtils.splitSmart(shards, \",\", true);\n\t\t\trb.shards = lst.toArray(new String[lst.size()]);\n\t\t\trb.isDistrib = true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nIf I have my component outside the package org.apache.solr.handler.component this doesn't work. Is it possible to make isDistrib public (or is this the wrong procedure/behaviour/design)?\n\nMany thanks,\nRok",
