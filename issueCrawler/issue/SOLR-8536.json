    "description": "I'm using SLF4J MDC to log additional Information in my WebApp. Some of my\nMDC-Parameters even include Line-Breaks.\nIt seems, that Solr takes all MDC parameters and puts them into the\nThread-Name, see\norg.apache.solr.common.util.ExecutorUtil.MDCAwareThreadPoolExecutor.execute(Runnable).\n\nWhen there is some logging of Solr, the log gets cluttered:\n\n[11.01.16 09:14:19:170 CET] 000002a3 SystemOut     O 09:14:19,169\n[zkCallback-14-thread-1-processing-My\nCustom\nMDC\nParameter ROraqiFWaoXqP21gu4uLpMh SANDHO] WARN\ncommon.cloud.ConnectionManager [session=ROraqiFWaoXqP21gu4uLpMh]\n[user=SANDHO]: zkClient received AuthFailed\n\n\n(some of my MDC-Parameters are only active in Email-Logs and are not\nincluded in the file-log)\n\nSolr should only put its own MDC-Parameter into the\nThread-Name.\n\nPossible Solution: Since all (as far as i can check) invocations in Solr of\nMDC.put uses a Prefix like \"ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient\" or\n\"CloudSolrClient\" etc., it would be possible to put a check into\nMDCAwareThreadPoolExecutor.execute(Runnable) that process only those\nPrefixes.\n\n\nSee also discussion on mailing list:\nTopic:Possible Bug - MDC handling in org.apache.solr.common.util.ExecutorUtil.MDCAwareThreadPoolExecutor.execute(Runnable)\nDate: Mon, 11 Jan 2016 09:00:43 GMT",
