This adds a maxCommitTime to the AddUpdateCommand - that only takes one document at at time, but the command is shared between everything updated together.\n\nAs implemented, If you post 1000 docs in a single request with an maxCommitTime=500.  It will fire a commit 500ms after the first document is added - even if there are still more coming. "
