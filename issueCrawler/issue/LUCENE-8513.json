            "content": "The result of this patch is that the sole usage remaining is org.apache.lucene.codecs.FieldsConsumer#merge. I didn't move this class to that package and weaken the visibility because there presently are a bunch of static methods still here but soon there won't be via LUCENE-7875. That one should have happened first but I got interested in this one this weekend. \u00a0It doesn't matter.\n\n\tRemoved static getFields and an inner class related to that.\n\tUpdated various tests accordingly \u2013 where most changes were. It'd be nice if getIndexedFields were sorted order but wasn't hard to get around.\n\tSlowCompositeReaderWrapper (now in Solr) is the primary non-test user. It was straight-forward to update using MultiFields.getTerms.\n\tFixed bug in MultiFields.getTerms that created a ReaderSlice with a readerIndex one smaller than it should have been. This was my bug. Apparently there has been no consumer of this bit of metadata to date that also got it via MultiFields.getTerms or else the bug would have been identified already. When I made SlowCompositeReaderWrapper switch to use getTerms, it uncovered this\u00a0bug\u00a0by code elsewhere in\u00a0Solr\u00a0related to faceting.\n\n ",
