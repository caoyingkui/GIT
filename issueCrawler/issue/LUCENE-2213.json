            "content": "Algorithm looks good.  The addition of the mandatory second argument works\nwell. Nice work.\n\nLooks like there's a typo in the currently unused constant \"NUM_BYTES_DOUBLT\".\n\nAs for the tests... Testing that optimizations like these are working properly\nis a pain, so I understand why you zapped 'em.  Sometimes inequality or\nproportional testing can work in these situations:\n\n\n  assertTrue(t.termBuffer().length > t.termLength());\n\n\n\nThat assertion wouldn't always hold true for this object, because sometimes\nthe term will fill the whole array.  And in a perfect world, you'd want to test that \neach and every array growth happens as expected \u2013 but that's not practical.  \nStill, in my opinion, a fragile, imperfect test in this situation is OK.

            "content": "Thanks Marvin, I fixed the typo.\n\nI don't really like that test, since conceivably (though, unlikely) it could fail with a false positive.\n\nSo I made a new test case (TestArrayUtil), which in fact uncovered serious problems with my first patch, due to overflowing int!  Sigh.  I've fixed those problems and the test now passes.  The test measures the amortized copying cost over a series of reallocations, and then [somewhat arbitrarily] asserts that the cost per element is less than 10.0 through all reallocations up to size Integer.MAX_INT.\n\nAlso I found one more place where we were assuming ArrayUtil.grow(X) returned the same value regardless of type, which is no longer true.  Amazing how tricky such a low-level utility function is.... ",

            "content": "Not to be picky, Michael, but is long promotion required here? Would it be easier to see if you overflow into negative integers and if so, set to MAX_VALUE?\n\nAnother thing \u2013 given the fact that the parameter is an int, you'll never be able to grow beyond Integer.MAX_VALUE (because no int value exists). I'd change the contract to reflect this fact \u2013 if the signature takes two parameters (int currentSize, int expectedAdditions) then it's easy to throw an unchecked exception if you simply can't meet the contract:\n\nif (currentSize + expectedAdditions < 0)\n  throw new RuntimeException(\"Cannot allocate array larger than: \" + Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n\nWhen reallocating, you can call it with grow(currentSize, 1), just to make sure the array will be at least one element larger than previously; the method can then make its best effort in estimating the growth ratio, but have a cap on MAX_SIZE before overflowing into negative integers (and avoid looping endlessly when Integer.MAX_VALUE is passed as an input argument).\n\nThese are just thoughts of course \u2013 I've just finished implementing something like this for another project...
