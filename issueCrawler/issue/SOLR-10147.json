    "description": "Currently in the Cloud -> Graph view there is a legend with color codes, but that is for replicas only.\n\nWe need a way to quickly see the state of the shard, in particular if it is active or inactive. For testing, create a collection, then call SPLITSHARD on shard1, and you'll end up with shards shard1, shard1_0 and shard1_1. It is not possible to see which one is active or inactive.\n\nAlso, the replicas belonging to the inactive shard are still marked with green \"Active\", while in reality they are \"Inactive\".\n\nThe simplest would be to add a new state \"Inactive\" with color e.g. blue, which would be used on both shard and replica level. But since an inactive replica could also be \"Gone\" or \"Down\", there should be some way to indicate both at the same time...",

I completely understand that would be somehow not suited to the eyes, less human-readable but for an inactive shard, there will be a leader and the nodes will have their own state (active,down,recovering) which will not be serving requests.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, along with feedback from others, I would like to write the patch for this after we decide on what we need.

We could use italics or bold, or even strikethrough in order to not being dependent on colors. BTW, it is bad practice to rely on colors only, ref color blind people or if you print the page on a B/W printer \n\nSo to try to improve on the existing states as well, what if we create a scheme with combinations of color and style, here is an attempt where we use bold to signify Leader, italic to mean recovering and strike-through means inactive, while double strikethrough means Gone.

Getting leader replica 'bold' is apt, but we can stick to 'green' as it is more soothing to the eyes to be honest.\nPF screenshot-2 and screenshot-3\n2. Double striking 'Gone' is making it difficult to read. If a node is gone, it should be in readable format for the user to pay attention, with double strike it looked messy.\n3. _italics_for 'Recovery' and 'Recovery failed' stands out.\nPF screenshot-4\n4. Striking 'inactive' both replicas and shard are apt. On screen, it is likeable.\n\nI have uploaded a patch 'SOLR-10147-v1.patch' considering the following for now:\n1. Bold for Leader, color still 'green'.\n2. Line-through for Inactive nodes and shard (no matter what condition it is).\n3. italics for 'Recovery' and 'Recovery failed'.\n3. Added Legend 'Inactive'.\n\nPF screenshot-5 and screenshot-6\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. ",
