Could behaviour be changed on branch_6x and branch_5x or only in master?\n\n#2 Consider this (intended or unintended) existing behaviour, deprecate the flag and add a new similar flag (updatesToLeadersOnly?) with the default value of the new flag preserving existing behaviour.\n\n#3 <something else>",
