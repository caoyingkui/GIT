    "description": "Scenario - Lets assume we have 10000 docs in solr and around 100 employees in an organisation .When an user queries the solr index , we filter the results based on department field and display it to the users. Now i wanted to implement spellcheck feature to that index.If spellcheck is implemented to solr index , when an user queries the index , the number of docs returned will be from the whole index while the docs displayed will be less as we have filtered based on department .\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuggest me a way to fix this .",
