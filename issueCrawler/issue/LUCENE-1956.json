    "description": "With LUCENE-1856 I removed some old, deprecated search methods, and with the HitCollector work new ones were introduced in 2.9. We need to fix the javadocs now in the search package, especially in classes like Searcher, Searchable, MultiSearcher, ParallelMultiSearcher, package.html, etc. \n\nWe should also make the javadocs more intuitive for the user: currently we call all search methods in Searchable \"low-level\" and most of them \"expert\". I think it's currently very confusing for the user to understand which methods to use.",
