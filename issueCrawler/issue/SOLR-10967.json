For example, comments like these are outdated \n\n\n This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named \"schema.xml\" and\n should be in the conf directory under the solr home\n (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default) \n or located where the classloader for the Solr webapp can find it.",

If we rely on a \"latest\"-based redirect, we would never notice if document-fields-and-schema-design.html goes away due to unrelated doc changes.  We would also never notice if the redirect itself changes in the future.  (I'm still in favor of making use of the redirect mentioned above, just wanted to mention this in case others think this is a big deal) ",
