Please see Bug 38911 (http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38911) for more information.\n\nThe commons-lang implementation has been heavily optimized as of version 2.2 (3x speed-up). I have reported the new implementation to TRStringDistance.",

I haven't analyzed them individually to know for sure, but if this is a much better implementation, then we should think about using it for FuzzyQuery, too.  \n\nThe FuzzyQuery (FuzzyTermEnum) version claims to have a fast-fail mechanism, too:\n\n<p>Embedded within this algorithm is a fail-fast Levenshtein distance\n\n\talgorithm.  The fail-fast algorithm differs from the standard Levenshtein\n\tdistance algorithm in that it is aborted if it is discovered that the\n\tmimimum distance between the words is greater than some threshold.\n   *\n\t<p>\n\n\n\nCedrik, since you seem to know about these things, would you have time to look at FuzzyTermEnum?  A 3x speedup there would be great for users, too. ",
