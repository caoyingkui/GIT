    "description": "Today a TermInSetQuery on field F and terms A, B, C returns this from toString:\n\n\n  F:A F:B F:C\n\n\n\nBut this gets misleading when you embed it in a BooleanQuery as a negated clause, which then renders like this:\n\n\n  -F:A F:B F:C\n\n\n\nMaking it look like only the first clause is negated when in fact they all are.\n\nSo ... I'd like to instead change it to:\n\n\nF:(A B C)\n\n\n\nI know Query.toString is simply best-effort, is not guaranteed to make something you can then parse in any query parser back to itself, etc., but I think we should still try to make a string that is not misleading when humans stare at it?",
