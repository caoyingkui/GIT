            "content": "A first version, some tests may use old API, which therefore not compile.\n\nThis is a very tricky pert, because you can do lots of errors. Things from 2.9 which were not 100% correct:\n\n\tCompoundFileReader.list() was there (deprec), but no listAll(). Renamed function. Does listAll/list difference has any effect in CFR?\n\tThere was one class to list() in SegmentInfos, replaced by listAll()\n\n\n\nThis patch also makes FSDir abstract and removes all deprecated methods and also the hell of reflection and the system properties.\n\nPatch still needs fine-tuning and test adaption.
