    "description": "We are using the RuleBasedAuthorization plugin. We are using the\ncollection-admin-edit permission to secure the collections API.\n\nWhat I have found is that if I try to, say, create or delete a\ncollection using a GET request I am prompted to authenticate as\nexpected.\n\nIf I try the same operation using a POST request, it lets me straight\nthrough and I can delete collections without authenticating.\n\nI emailed Noble Paul directly about this initially and he has confirmed this as a bug.",
