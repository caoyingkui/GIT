            "content": "Here is a patch which sums up term frequencies for each unique norm value in the impacts. I also did some refactorings to the way impacts are leveraged by TermScorer by introducing a new ImpactsDISI which abstracts how to leverage impacts to efficiently skip non-competitive documents. It is used by TermQuery, FeatureQuery and SynonymQuery, and maybe soon PhraseQuery as well.\n\nI hacked luceneutil to run disjunctions as synonym queries to check the impact of this change when total hit counts are not tracked:\n \u00a0\n\n                    TaskQPS baseline      StdDev   QPS patch      StdDev                Pct diff\n       HighTermMonthSort      158.74     (10.5%)      144.83     (10.2%)   -8.8% ( -26% -   13%)\n                HighTerm     1460.56      (5.3%)     1395.35      (3.5%)   -4.5% ( -12% -    4%)\n   HighTermDayOfYearSort       66.81      (9.3%)       64.08     (11.7%)   -4.1% ( -22% -   18%)\n             AndHighHigh       33.33      (5.0%)       32.15      (3.5%)   -3.5% ( -11% -    5%)\n                 MedTerm     1738.21      (4.9%)     1687.75      (3.2%)   -2.9% ( -10% -    5%)\n                 LowTerm     3582.99      (3.4%)     3496.28      (3.9%)   -2.4% (  -9% -    5%)\n              AndHighMed      154.32      (3.7%)      151.61      (2.7%)   -1.8% (  -7% -    4%)\n                 Prefix3       89.89      (5.0%)       89.15      (5.6%)   -0.8% ( -10% -   10%)\n                  IntNRQ       34.35     (13.9%)       34.21     (15.0%)   -0.4% ( -25% -   33%)\n               LowPhrase     1815.14      (3.1%)     1809.71      (3.0%)   -0.3% (  -6% -    6%)\n               MedPhrase      163.59      (1.4%)      163.20      (1.3%)   -0.2% (  -2% -    2%)\n        HighSloppyPhrase       12.22      (4.8%)       12.19      (4.8%)   -0.2% (  -9% -    9%)\n                 Respell      195.28      (2.4%)      194.94      (1.9%)   -0.2% (  -4% -    4%)\n                Wildcard      103.19      (2.7%)      103.02      (2.9%)   -0.2% (  -5% -    5%)\n                  Fuzzy2      159.47      (4.9%)      159.23      (7.6%)   -0.2% ( -12% -   13%)\n         MedSloppyPhrase       58.26      (4.2%)       58.22      (4.5%)   -0.1% (  -8% -    8%)\n         LowSloppyPhrase       61.14      (2.4%)       61.19      (2.6%)    0.1% (  -4% -    5%)\n             LowSpanNear       92.96      (3.7%)       93.13      (3.4%)    0.2% (  -6% -    7%)\n             MedSpanNear       48.08      (3.4%)       48.22      (3.3%)    0.3% (  -6% -    7%)\n                  Fuzzy1      312.46      (6.6%)      313.81     (11.1%)    0.4% ( -16% -   19%)\n            HighSpanNear        7.00      (5.5%)        7.03      (5.6%)    0.4% ( -10% -   12%)\n              HighPhrase       27.40      (2.6%)       27.53      (2.9%)    0.5% (  -4% -    6%)\n              AndHighLow     1219.32      (3.6%)     1233.33      (4.1%)    1.1% (  -6% -    9%)\n               OrHighMed       30.41      (7.7%)      141.92     (13.6%)  366.6% ( 320% -  420%)\n              OrHighHigh       23.02      (7.3%)      145.78     (16.6%)  533.4% ( 474% -  601%)\n               OrHighLow       35.95      (7.7%)      234.72     (19.9%)  552.9% ( 488% -  628%)\n\n ",
