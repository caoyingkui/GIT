    "description": "SNAPSHOT's cannot actually be used and released by Lucene/Solr, but we use them downstream in some cases during development - we have to harmonize jars across multiple projects.\n\nIt would be nice if we could avoid doing the check sum check on SNAPSHOT's, but still do the license check (dev adds any dependency, dev must add license immediately).\n\nThis first patch adds a new system property called skipSnapshotsChecksum - if you set it to true, SNAPSHOT dependency's will not be check sum compared.\n\nI think this change makes the license checker more consumable.",
