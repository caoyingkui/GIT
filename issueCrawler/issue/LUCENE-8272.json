This change refactors\n    this non-trivial code to share the same code path and only differ in\n    if we provide a binary or numeric instance. This also allows us to\n    iterator over the updates only once rather than twice once for numeric\n    and once for binary fields.\n\n    This change also subclass DocValuesIterator from DocValuesFieldUpdates.Iterator\n    which allows easier consumption down the road since it now shares most of it's\n    interface with DocIdSetIterator which is the main interface for this in Lucene.",
