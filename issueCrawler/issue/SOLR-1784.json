Other errors in facet expressions are reported as a successful request with an element called 'exception' giving a stack trace.\n\nAll requests to Solr should succeed completely or fail, and failures should return as an appropriate HTTP protocol error.",

Excluding an undefined tag has been defined to be the same as excluding nothing, hence the facet counts will be unchanged.  Can you provide an example where no facet results are returned? "
