    "description": "had some time on a plane this weekend, so I adapted some of the clover hooks from Java-Lucene to Solr's build.xml and also put in hooks for running PMD (a bug pattern finding tool).\n\nthe PMD hook actually teste the PMD ruleset twice, once warning about any violations, and once failing the build if any serious violations were found ... the goal would be to hook this into the \"ant test\" target so you can't successfully build if you have any serious rule violations.\n\ni strarted with a custom ruleset based on some of the bigger rules from PMD ... the theory being that as well clean up the code base we can add more nit-picky rules if we want to \n\nUser is required to provide their own copy of PMD and/or clover on in an ANT_LIB. Clover requires (ASF committer) license, PMD is freely available...\n\nhttp://pmd.sourceforge.net/",

            "content": "my thinking is that initially PMD would be a completely optional step, which committers are encouraged to run before committing, and which the nightly build runs with the \"serious\" threshold low enough that only extreme rules cause a build failure. ... the main goal would be having a report on the live site showing where in the nightly builds questionable behavior is (mush as the goal of clover is to have the reports about hte nightlies to see where we need more test coverage)\n\ni agree \u2013 it PMD shouldn't be mandatory just to build Solr.\n\nI can't make any specific comments about PMD being better then the tools that various IDEs have ... as i understand it many IDEs use either PMD or FindBugs ... my goal was just to have something that could be run as part of theautomated builds.\n\n(by all means: people using IDEs with code inspectors should run them and fix anything that looks suspicious) "

They run during \"site\" generation which generates reports, although they can also be used to fail a build if desired.\n\nThe eclipse plugin for PMD is great, because it includes links to the detailed description on why the issues are a bad practice.  There were a few links missing, but I added a patch to add the missing links.  However there is a bug in the eclipse plugin where the links stop working if you export the ruleset.
