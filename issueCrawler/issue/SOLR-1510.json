Originally solrj knew how to handle different cores.\n\nWhat is the advantage of a single EmbeddedSolrServer talking to multiple cores vs an EmbeddedSolrServer for each core?

There is no reason why an EmbeddedSolrServer should not be able to use those features. We can always add a 'core' parameter to the commands and it should work fine. Yes, adding a core parameter is inconsistent with the standard http mode but it is definitely better than not having the feature at all "
