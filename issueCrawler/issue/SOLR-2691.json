    "description": "With the trunk build, running SolrCloud, if I issue a PERSIST CoreAdmin command,\nthe solr.xml gets overwritten with only the last core, repeated as many times\nas there are cores.\n\nIt used to work fine with a trunk build from a couple of months ago, so it looks like\nsomething broke solr.xml persistence. \n\nIt appears to have been introduced by SOLR-2331:\nCoreContainer#persistFile creates the map for core attributes (coreAttribs) outside \nof the loop that iterates over cores. Therefore, all cores reuse the same map of attributes\nand hence only the values from the last core are preserved and used for all cores in the list.\n\nI'm running SolrCloud, using:\n-Dbootstrap_confdir=/opt/solr/solr/conf -Dcollection.configName=hcpconf -DzkRun\n\nI'm starting Solr with four cores listed in solr.xml:\n\n<solr persistent=\"true\">\n  <cores adminPath=\"/admin/cores\" defaultCoreName=\"master1\">\n    <core name=\"master1\" instanceDir=\"master1\" shard=\"shard1\" collection=\"hcpconf\" />\n    <core name=\"master2\" instanceDir=\"master2\" shard=\"shard2\" collection=\"hcpconf\" />\n    <core name=\"slave1\" instanceDir=\"slave1\" shard=\"shard1\" collection=\"hcpconf\" />\n    <core name=\"slave2\" instanceDir=\"slave2\" shard=\"shard2\" collection=\"hcpconf\" />\n  </cores>\n</solr>\n\nI then issue a PERSIST request:\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=PERSIST\n\nAnd the solr.xml turns into:\n\n<solr persistent=\"true\">\n  <cores defaultCoreName=\"master1\" adminPath=\"/admin/cores\" zkClientTimeout=\"10000\" hostPort=\"8983\" hostContext=\"solr\">\n    <core shard=\"shard2\" instanceDir=\"slave2/\" name=\"slave2\" collection=\"hcpconf\"/>\n    <core shard=\"shard2\" instanceDir=\"slave2/\" name=\"slave2\" collection=\"hcpconf\"/>\n    <core shard=\"shard2\" instanceDir=\"slave2/\" name=\"slave2\" collection=\"hcpconf\"/>\n    <core shard=\"shard2\" instanceDir=\"slave2/\" name=\"slave2\" collection=\"hcpconf\"/>\n  </cores>\n</solr>",

            "content": "patch of persistence tests at the CoreContainer level (since that's where the bug was)  that incorporates Yury's fix.\n\nthe assertions could definitely be beefed up to sanity check more aspects of the serialization, and we should really also be testing that \"load\" works and parses all of these things back in in the expected way as well, but it's a start.\n\nThe thing that's currently hanging me up is that somehow the test is leaking a SolrIndexSearcher reference.  I thought maybe it was because of the SolrCores i was creating+registering and then ignoring, but if i try to close them i get an error about too many decrefs instead.\n\nI'll let miller figure it out "
