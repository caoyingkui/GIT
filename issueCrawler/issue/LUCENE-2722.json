    "description": "I'm working on improving Lucene's performance with int block codecs\n(FOR/PFOR), but in early perf testing I found that these codecs cause\na big perf hit to those MTQs that need to scan many terms but don't\nend up accepting many of those terms (eg fuzzy, wildcard, regexp).\n\nThis is because sep codec stores much more in the terms dict, since\neach file is separate, ie seek points for each of doc, frq, pos, pyl,\nskp files.\n\nSo I'd like to shift these seek points to instead be stored in the doc\nfile, except for the doc seek point itself.  Since a given query will\nalways need to seek to the doc file, this does not add an extra seek.\nBut it saves tons of vInt decodes for the next/seke intensive MTQs...",
