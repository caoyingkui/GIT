Atleast that suggests the user that the feature is disabled .There can be a link alongside the disabled link which can point to the wiki page.\n\nwell, partly because it makes the index.jsp more complicated, but also because it doesn't seem any more straightforward from a user perspective.  we can put links to a wiki page directly on the replication/distribution JSPs just as easily as we can put them next to links on the main admin screen \u2013 but if you only put them on the main admin screen you've still got to worry about people with bookmarks directly to the page.
