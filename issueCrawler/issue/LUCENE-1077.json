            "content": "This is a fairly trivial start to to this, but it creates the sinks package in the contrib/Analysis section and adds a simple TokenRangeSinkTokenizer and test.  This can be used to siphon off tokens that fall in a range.  All it does is count the tokens that go by and add those that fall in the range.  It might be useful for documents that you know have certain structures.  For instance, if you know the first 5 tokens of your docs are X.\n\nMore to follow. ",
