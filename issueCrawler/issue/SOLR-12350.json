    "description": "When improving data-driven mode in\u00a0SOLR-9526 we discussed back and forth whether to set useDocValuesAsStored for the *_str copy of text fields. This dynamic field is currently defined as\n\n<dynamicField name=\"*_str\" type=\"strings\" stored=\"false\" docValues=\"true\" indexed=\"false\" />\n\nHaving lived with the current setting since 7.0, I think it is too noisy to return all the _str fields since this is redundant content from the analysed original field. Thus I propose to do as Hoss Man initially suggested, and explicitly set it to false starting from 7.4:\n\n<dynamicField name=\"*_str\" type=\"strings\" stored=\"false\" indexed=\"false\" docValues=\"true\" useDocValuesAsStored=\"false\" />\n\n\nNote that this does not change how things are stored, only whether to display these by default. The *_str fields will still be available for sorting, faceting etc.",

The *_str field is still \n  created and can be used for e.g. sorting, but to retrieve it you now need to explicitly list it in \"fl\" (SOLR-12350) \n\n\nWill commit tomorrow. ",
