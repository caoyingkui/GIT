    "description": "As follow up on SOLR-3982, the Auto-Refresh Option could be extended:\n\nThe current workflow could be describe as this:\nIf you click on \"Execute\", the full- or delta-import is started. afterwards a status update is triggered automatically. if the status is 'busy' and you check the auto-refresh option, it will schedule another status up in 2 seconds.\n\nHaving said that, what isn't catched at the moment is a \"External Import-Trigger\". The UI does not detected that, one has to trigger the Status Update at least once manually to join that \"status-circle\" which is described in the workflow.",
