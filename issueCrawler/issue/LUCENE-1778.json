    "description": "Following LUCENE-1774, this will add support for log.step per task name, rather than a single log.step setting for all tasks. The .alg file will support:\n\n\tlog.step - for all tasks.\n\tlog.step.<Task Class Name> - for a specific task. For example, log.step.AddDoc, or log.step.DeleteDoc\n\n\n\nI will post the patch soon",

Its not horribly off, but its off, and their are some tasks it doesn't list.\n\nRelating to this issue, it also still mentions: doc.tokenize.log.step, which is no longer used. Not fixed in my patch, but should this now be: log.step.ReadTokens ? I'm not sure offhand what used to use that log name. ",

Since we document log.step.[class] above it, I saw no reason to keep it there. ",
