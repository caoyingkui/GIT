    "description": "It would be good to be able to match any regex as part of a having expression etc...\n\nLucene/Solr does support regex queries but the match Evaluator would match against un-analyzed blocks of texts, so it would eliminate any confusion about what terms it was actually matching against.\n\nThis would support use cases like alerting on sensitive content that appear in documents such as SSN and credit card numbers.",
