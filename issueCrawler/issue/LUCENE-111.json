    "description": "Hi,\n\nWe are using lucene search engine 1.2 to search for images in our imaging web \nsite .\n\nEverytime we add a new image to the database, an index also get created based \non the image name and search keywords using lucene index creator.\n\nWe have around 180,000 images in the database, but after creating about 80,000 \nindexes, the upload program gives the following error:\n\n\"Too many files open\". Cannot open the file \"_yaf.tii\"\n\nPls help us to resolve this matter?\n\nIs there any limitation of files when creating the indexes?\n\nThanks & Best Regards\n\nRalani",
