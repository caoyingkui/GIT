    "description": "(UnifiedHighlighter) Passage.java has a variety of package-level fields and methods that are accessed by FieldHighlighter.highlightOffsetsEnums (the kernel of the UH).  It should be possible for people to extend this method to tweak the process of producing passages.  That method is extensible but Passage.java is too closed.  Even if one were to write their own equivalent to Passage.java, it would be impossible to then use PassageScorer or PassageFormatter.",

Dawid Weiss helpfully pointed out that the OffsetsEnum class in the UnifiedHighlighter should also have it's methods be made public, otherwise someone subclassing to override FieldHighlighter#highlightOffsetsEnums can't really do anything useful.  And doing that is the primary motivation for making Passage extensible.\n\nAdditionally, it'd be good to add a basic test in TestUnifiedHighlighterExtensibility showing we got this right. ",
