    "description": "Taking a look to the current implementation for the Spellchecker, the first thing I noticed is that is a little bit spread across Solr and Lucene.\nActually it is not easy to place the issue in one or the other.\nAs a first observation it should follow the AutoSuggest structure, so it should be in Lucene.\n\nIn particular this issue reflects the requirement of having the possibility of a Spellchecker queryTime/ index Time aware of the analysis.\n\nCurrently the analysis is applied in Solr at query time , but it is not possible to configure the analysis that is going to be used to then build the Index time FST used for matching the spell corrections.\n\nWe should discuss a design  ( I know it would be quite a big work to refactor the spellcheck module, so maybe we are not going to do big changes but simply implement the requirement)",
