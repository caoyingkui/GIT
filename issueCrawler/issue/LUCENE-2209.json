The Javadoc compatibility contract is that future versions of javadoc won't add tags that have periods in their name so it's the way to avoid collisions (you should actauly see a warning about using a tag without a \".\" in it's name from javadoc when you declare these.\n\nSo i would suggest @lucene.internal, @lucene.expert, @lucene.experimental, etc...
