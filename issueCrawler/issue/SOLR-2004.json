    "description": "Using Solr example environment w/ small changes (set autowarmCount to 100 for all cache) and I see the size of filterCache is 11 in admin GUI just after query the following:\n\n\nq=*:*&facet=on&facet.field=cat\n\n\n\nThen execute ./post.sh to run autowarm. When I use LRUCache for the cache, its inserts count is 12 (I expected it would be 11, but actually 12?), however, if I use FastLRUCache, its inserts count is 0 (but size is 11. I think it shows that autowarm worked correctly).",
