Once loaded, a\n\tsynonym lookup via \n{@link #getSynonyms(String)}\ntakes constant time O(1).\n\tA loaded default synonym map consumes about 10 MB main memory.\n\tAn instance is immutable, hence thread-safe.\n\t<p>\n\tThis implementation borrows some ideas from the\n\tLucene Syns2Index demo that Dave Spencer\n\tdave@searchmorph.com originally contributed to Lucene. Dave's approach\n\tinvolved a persistent Lucene index which is suitable for occasional\n\tlookups or very large synonym tables, but considered unsuitable for\n\thigh-frequency lookups of medium size synonym tables.\n\t<p>\n\tExample Usage:\n\t<pre>\n\tString[] words = new String[] \n{ \"hard\", \"woods\", \"forest\", \"wolfish\",\n\"xxxx\"}\n;\n\tSynonymMap map = SynonymMap(new FileInputStream(\"samples/data/wn_s.pl\"));\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) \n{\n *     String[] synonyms = map.getSynonyms(words[i]);\n *     System.out.println(words[i] + \":\" +\njava.util.Arrays.asList(synonyms).toString());\n * }\n\t\n\tExample output:\n\thard:[arduous, backbreaking, difficult, fermented, firmly, grueling,\ngruelling, heavily, heavy, intemperately, knockout, laborious, punishing,\nsevere, severely, strong, toilsome, tough]\n\twoods:[forest, wood]\n\tforest:[afforest, timber, timberland, wood, woodland, woods]\n\twolfish:[edacious, esurient, rapacious, ravening, ravenous, voracious,\nwolflike]\n\txxxx:[]\n\t</pre>\n\t\n\t@author whoschek.AT.lbl.DOT.gov\n\t@see <a target=\"_blank\"\n\thref=\"http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/man/prologdb.5WN.html\">prologdb\n\tman page </a>\n\t@see <a target=\"_blank\"\nhref=\"http://www.hostmon.com/rfc/advanced.jsp\">Dave's synonym demo site</a>\n */\n\n ",
