So your options are:\n\n\tdisable DIH completely (yeah, not so nice)\n\tupdate to later version\n\tinstruct your reverse proxy to remove \"dataConfig\" parameter before passing to Solr. I have seen configs for nginx doing similar things with the \"stream.body\" parameters.\n\trun Solr only on localhost\n\tinstall a firewall (that's a joke, you should have done this already)\n\n\n\nOne thing that might work (not sure yet):\n\n\tmake dataConfig a \"invariant\" in solrconfig.xml. Does anybody know if this works for DIH, too?\n\n ",
