There are numerous offenders, mostly wrt. white spaces around keywords and expressions, sample blow.\n\nfor( int i=0; i<res.size(); i++ ) {\nprivate List<Cluster> clusters=new LinkedList<Cluster>();\nfor(NamedList<Object> clusterNode:clusterInfo){\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIt'd be nice to submit patches as SVN diffs rather than IntelliJ's diffs (which contain additional stuff that may be problematic when merging?).\n\n\n\n\n\tI'd change Cluster#docs to Cluster#docIds which is more explicit.\n\n\n\n\n\tDon't know if it's possible but ideally I'd like the test to parse an actual output from the clustering handler... this way you could avoid having a hardcoded response which may go out of sync with the actual response. Shamefully I haven't kept track with solrj development recently so you'd need to dig the code and see if this is at all doable. If not, so be it, we'll live with the hardcoded response.\n\n ",
