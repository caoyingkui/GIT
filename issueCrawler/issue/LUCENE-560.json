    "description": "It seems that if you try to use a SpanNear query as the \"exclude\" argument to a SpanNot query, you encounter an NPE.  The stack trace looks like the following (as of trunk r398639) ...\n\n    [junit] java.lang.NullPointerException\n    [junit]     at org.apache.lucene.search.spans.NearSpans.doc(NearSpans.java:227)\n    [junit]     at org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNotQuery$1.next(SpanNotQuery.java:85)\n    [junit]     at org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanScorer.next(SpanScorer.java:51)\n    [junit]     at org.apache.lucene.search.Scorer.score(Scorer.java:47)\n    [junit]     at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:132)\n\npatch to TestBasics demonstrating bug will be attached shortly.  I believe the problem is that SpanNotQuery$1 is calling \"excludeSpans.doc()\" without ever calling \"excludeSpans.next()\" ... this \"works\" when the exclude query is a TermQuery becuase the value returned by doc() is -1 ... but with SpanNearQuery tries to pop the initial value off of a queue which hasn't been initialized yet.",
