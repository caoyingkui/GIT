            "content": "MultiTermsEnum and MultiDocsEnum both expose their subs\n\nI don't see this in the code of MultiTermsEnum. Both have the arrays private and MultiTermsEnum has no getter (at least in trunk). MultiDocsEnum has a getter (not sure why). In MultiTermsEnum there is one public getter, but this one returns a package private class, so unuseable to the user (this is a bug) - should be removed.\n\nThis patch is fine if you make the methods return List<Terms> and List<ReaderSlice>, both with Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(...)). But ReaderSlice is also a more or less \"private\" class (its just public for cross-package access).\n\nWhat's the reason to have those public at all? ",

These are expert level APIs that are not on the base class (hence will never be used casually).\n\nWhat's the reason to have those public at all?\n\nSometimes better efficiency, sometimes more information.  One example for this specific addition is that MultiTerms.size() always returns -1.  If we look at the sub-terms we can at least see what the number of terms for each segment is. ",
