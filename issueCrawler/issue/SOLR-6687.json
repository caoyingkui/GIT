    "description": "I am writing a search bar application with Solr which I'd like to have the following two features:\n\nphrase matching for user queries - results which match user phrase are boosted.\n\nField faceting based on 'tags' field.  \n\nWhen I execute this query:\n\nq=steve jobs&\nfq=storeid:527bd613e4b0564cc755460a&\nsort=score desc&\nstart=50&\nrows=2&\nfl=*,score&\nqt=/query&\ndefType=edismax&\npf=concept_name^15 note_text^5 file_text^2.5&\npf3=1&\npf2=1&\nps=1&\ngroup=true&\ngroup.field=conceptid&\ngroup.limit=10&\ngroup.ngroups=true\n\nThe phrase boosting feature operates correctly and boosts results which closer match the phrase query \"Steve Jobs\"\n\nHowever, when I execute the query after the user has selected a facet field (The facet fields are bought up from a seperate query) and execute the following query:\n\nq=steve jobs&\nfq=storeid:527bd613e4b0564cc755460a&\nfq=tag:Person&\nsort=score desc&\nstart=0&\nrows=50&\nfl=*,score&\nqt=/query&\ndefType=edismax&\npf=concept_name^15 note_text^5 file_text^2.5&\npf3=1&\npf2=1&\nps=1&\ngroup=true&\ngroup.field=conceptid&\ngroup.limit=10&\ngroup.ngroups=true\n\nThe phrase boosting does not work, even though the facet filtering does.  \n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug, but if it is not can someone point me to the relevant documentation that will help me fix this issue?  All queries were written using the SolrJ Library.",

It gets more eyes and you may well get a much faster response.\n\nWhen you do post over there, what assurance do you have that boosting \"doesn't work\"? Have you tried using &debug=all and examining the scores in the two cases? ",
