            "content": "Patch attached to this issue.\n\nDue to the fact that SolrCLI.CreateTool was delegating the job  of creating the collection/core via SolrCLI.ToolBase#runTool(CommandLine) to the coresponding tool (CreateCollectionTool/CreateCoreTool), the exit code of the operation was being lost.\n\nCalling instead  SolrCLI.ToolBase#runImpl(CommandLine) will generate an exception which will be caught in SolrCLI.ToolBase#runTool(CommandLine) and so, the invalid exit code status will be correctly returned when exiting from SolrCLI, while the functionality previously provided is still kept.\n\nVia SolrCloudExampleTest.java I've added new instructions to be used for verifying that a collection can't be created again, once that it exists. Unfortunately, the test case is annotated with @LuceneTestCase.BadApple reason why it won't be taken into account by the tests. ",
