Sometimes one user is just one that thinks differently from the person who implemented it. Are lots of users confused?\n\nNo matter what, we disable some and then some user later is going to want all the stats for all the handlers and then we're in the same position as with example schemas. We tweak and tweak and tweak and then absolutely no one is happy.\n\nInstead of completely disabling some metrics we should instead explore making it easier to get to the metrics a user thinks are most important. I get the point about noise, but let's think of ways to reduce it with other ways - maybe user-controlled tags?  ",
