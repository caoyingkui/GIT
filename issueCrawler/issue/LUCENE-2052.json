Varargs are more for cases like instantiating a MultiReader with 5 IndexReaders or something like that. Or adding a bunch of clauses to a SpanQuery.\nThe varargs Set<?> is one unit, arrays are not needed (they are there because of BW compatibility). All these ctors except Set<?> should have been deprecated in 2.9. ",
