    "description": "This patch enables a Lucene-powered concordance search capability.\n\nConcordances are extremely useful for linguists, lawyers and other analysts performing analytic search vs. traditional snippeting/document retrieval tasks.  By \"analytic search,\" I mean that the user wants to browse every time a term appears (or at least the topn)  in a subset of documents and see the words before and after.  \n\nConcordance technology is far simpler and less interesting than IR relevance models/methods, but it can be extremely useful for some use cases.\n\nTraditional concordance sort orders are available (sort on words before the target, words after, target then words before and target then words after).\n\nUnder the hood, this is running SpanQuery's getSpans() and reanalyzing to obtain character offsets.  There is plenty of room for optimizations and refactoring.\n\nMany thanks to my colleague, Jason Robinson, for input on the design of this patch.",

After creating an account there, the workflow is: manually upload a patch, assign a reviewer (could be the \"lucene\" group, in which case review requests go to the dev list, or a RB account-holder, including yourself), then publish.  Thereafter anybody can review by clicking on one or more adjacent lines in a patch and attaching a comment, repeating till done, then publishing, and the original review request creator can update the patch, and anybody can view differences between any two patched versions, and also attach reviews to the patched version differences.

Here goes (apologies for some repetition with the issue description)...\n\nFor an example of concordance output, see these slides.  Slides 23 and 24 for LUCENE-5317 and slides 25-28 for LUCENE-5318.\n\nThe notion is that you present every time the term appears in the central column with x number of words to the left and right.  The user can sort on words before the target term to see what modifies it, or the user can sort on words after the target term to see what it modifies, or the user can sort on order of appearance within the documents to effectively read everything in their docs that matters to them. \n\n By target term, of course, I mean any term/phrase that can be represented by a SpanQuery.\n\nThis kind of view of the data is extremely helpful to linguists and philologists to understand how words are being used.  It also has practical applications for anyone doing \"analytic\" search, that is, they want to see every time a term/phrase appears \u2013 lawyers, patent examiners, etc.\n\nThis view of the data is fundamentally different from snippets, which typically show the three or so best chunks where the search terms appear, and they're typically ordered per document.  Snippets allow the user to determine if a document is relevant, then the user has to open the document.  Snippets are great if users are seeking the best document to answer their information need.  \n\nFor \"analytic searchers\", however, with concordance results, the user can be saved the step of having to open the document; they can see every time their term/phrase appears.  Also, for \"analytic searchers\", if their documents are lengthy, the concordance allows them to see the potentially hundreds of times that their term/phrase appears in each document instead of the three or so snippets they might see with traditional search engines.\n\n\"But you can increase the number of snippets to whatever you want...\"  Yes, you can, but the layout of the concordance allows you to see patterns across documents very easily.  Again, the results are sorted by words to the left or right, not by which document the target appeared in.\n\nThis link shows some output from a concordancer (AntConc).  Wikipedia's best description is under key word in context (KWIC). If you're into tree-ware, Oakes has a great introduction to concordances among many other useful topics! ",
