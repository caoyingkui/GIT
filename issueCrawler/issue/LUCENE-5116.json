No matter what I do \u2013 call IW.deleteDocuments(new MADQ()) or IW.deleteDocuments(new TermQuery()) \u2013 basically a query that matches all the documents in a segment, the segment is dropped on the next commit. Is it even possible to add a segment with all documents deleted?\n\nThe fix is general (compares segment.numDocs > 0), so it will capture those cases too ... only I currently fail to reproduce one. Any ideas how I can repro it? ",
