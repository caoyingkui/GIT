            "content": "Matt: As noted in SOLR-2915 and on the mailing list, i think you have a misunderstanding of how the UpdateRequestProcessor APIs work ... the  RunUpdateProcessor.processCommit method is what is responsible for executing the underlying commit on the index \u2013 it is not a callback method notified if/when a commit happens.  If you are looking for a callback method, please see the event listener API...\n\nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/Solr-trunk/javadoc/org/apache/solr/core/SolrEventListener.html\n\nfurthermore, i'm not sure i understand what you mean by \"when Lucene is intermittently committing documents during the process\" \u2014 The underlying Lucene IndexWriter does not intermittently commit anything ... perhaps you are asking about segment merging? or Solr's autoCommit?\n\nPlease follow up by starting a thread on the solr-user mailing list with more information about what exactly it is you are trying to achieve, and what behavior you are seeing \u2013 because from what i can tell there doesn't seem to be a bug here.
