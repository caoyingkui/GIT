    "description": "When asking for flags like OFFSETS or PAYLOADS with DocsAndPositionsEnum, the behavior was to always return an enum, even if offsets or payloads were not indexed.  They would just not be available from the enum if they were not present.  This behavior was carried over to PostingsEnum, which is good.\n\nHowever, the new POSITIONS flag has different behavior.  If positions are not available, null is returned, instead of a PostingsEnum that just gives access to freqs.  This behavior is confusing, as it means you have to special case asking for positions (only ask if you know they were indexed) which sort of defeats the purpose of the unified PostingsEnum.\n\nWe should make POSITIONS have the same behavior as other flags. The trickiest part will be maintaining backcompat for DocsAndPositionsEnum in 5.x, but I think it can be done.",

            "content": "I agree, Terms.hasPositions(), Terms.hasFreqs(), Terms.hasPayloads(), Terms.hasOffsets() should be used for these checks up-front.\n\nFor the backwards behavior, in 5.x we could use an internal flag to make this work. We still need to improve the flags anyway (e.g. to not overlap, and for the new ones to be a little simpler). This is probably good to do first, I sitll have the issue open for it. "

For a while I thought it was valid and I kept guarding against it and in one case wrote some ugly loop that downgrades bits until non-null.  I don't believe it happened in practice but the docs allowed it so...\n\nRyan Ernst If you don't want to do it or are too busy, I could simply update the javadocs on master & 7x.\nCC Alan Woodward as LUCENE-4524 was highly related and was the commit that actually has the current javadocs about null being permitted.
