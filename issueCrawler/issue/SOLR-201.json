    "description": "someone at work migrating from a pre-apache version of solr to the latest release ran into a nasty NegativeArraySizeException\ntoday today because of these lines in DocSetHitCollector...\n\n  static int HASHDOCSET_MAXSIZE= SolrConfig.config.getInt(\"//HashDocSet/@maxSize\",-1);\n  final int[] scratch = new int[HASHDOCSET_MAXSIZE];\n\n(apparently in the version she was migrating from, not having that option set worked fine, i'm guessing it just never used HashDocSets)\n\nwe should fix that so it either has a sensible default, or at the very least throws a usefull error message .. it's probably worth auditing all of the config options as well.  \n\n(i'm imagining a unit test using a solrconfig.xml file that is completely blank, and verifies that Solr starts up fine without exceptions, logs a bunch of warnings, and then sits there unable to do anything (since no request handlers are registered)",
