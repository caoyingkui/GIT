    "description": "TermsComponent class always tries to fetch all terms from all shards\u00a0for a further processing. There is\u00a0 java.lang.OutOfMemoryError\u00a0 exception if the resulting list is too long. Solr stops working on this shard after this exception, only restart helps.\u00a0\n\nThere is a very common use case when the full terms list is not required: a client needs to see\u00a0next N terms in alphabetically sorted list starting with a given value. Usually, this is needed for some autocomplete field on a page.\n\nExample URL:\u00a0\n http://localhost:8983/solr/mycollection/terms?terms.fl=fulltext&terms.sort=index&terms.lower=cat&terms.limit=50\n \u00a0\n In this example\u00a0TermsComponent needs to fetch only\u00a050 terms from each shard starting with a value provided in terms.lower URL parameter.\u00a0So, it should not reset TermsParams.TERMS_LIMIT parameter when generates a shard query in\u00a0createSmartShardQuery() method.\n\nThe patch\u00a0is attached.",
