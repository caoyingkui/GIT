    "description": "The ElisionFilterFactory is useful for removing french articles from words (e.g. l'avion -> avion, see its tests).\n\nBut the factory itself isnt very friendly, you need to provide an actual text file listing these, which is sorta overkill\nSuch a text file would look like:\n\n# below are my articles\nl\nm\nt\n...\n\n\n\nI propose instead of throwing a RuntimeException if you dont provide the articles param, to just use the default set\nalready in ElisionFilter: (l, m, t, qu, n, s, j)\n\nIt wont backwards break anyone as if they weren't providing it, they were getting RuntimeException before.",
