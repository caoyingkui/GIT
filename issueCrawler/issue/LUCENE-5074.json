    "description": "There is no way to specify an open-ended numeric range query using the XML query parser syntax.  To be consistent with the usage in the NumericRangeQuery API, which accepts <code>null</code> as an indicator of a missing range endpoint, I propose interpreting an empty or missing <code>lower</code> or <code>upper</code> attribute in the XML syntax in the same way.",

Also I have a RegexpQueryBuilder I could contribute.  In the interests of consistency, I'm including similar null-accepting patches for NumericRangeFilterBuilder (exactly like QueryBuilder), but I haven't added RangeQueryBuilder or RegexpQueryBuilder here - seems like a separate issue.\n ",
