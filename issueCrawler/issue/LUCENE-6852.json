    "description": "This is phase 2 for adding dimensional indexing in Lucene, so we can (eventually) do efficient numeric range filtering, BigInteger/Decimal and IPv6 support, and \"point in shape\" spatial searching (2D or 3D).\n\nIt's the follow-on from LUCENE-6825 (phase 1).\n\nThis issue \"just\" adds DimensionalFormat (and Reader/Writer) to Codec and the IndexReader hierarchy, to IndexWriter and merging, and to document API (DimensionalField).\n\nI also implemented dimensional support for SimpleTextCodec, and added a test case showing that you can in fact use SimpleTextCodec to do multidimensional shape intersection (seems to pass a couple times!).\n\nPhase 3 will be adding support to the default codec as well (\"just\" wrapping BKDWriter/Reader), phase 4 is then fixing places that use the sandbox/spatial3d BKD tree to use the codec instead and maybe exposing\nsugar for numerics, things like BigInteger/Decimal, etc.\n\nThere are many nocommits still, but I think it's close-ish ... I'll commit to a branch and iterate there.",

TestDimensionalValues forces SimpleTextCodec and test various usages (including showing how BigInteger range searching will work), and seems to pass.\n\nNext phase is to fix the default codec to also implement it ... I'll open a follow-on issue. "
