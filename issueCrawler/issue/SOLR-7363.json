In looking at the stack trace it appears that the DocList is not handled the same way with Grouped results, and the ExpandComponent relies on the DocList. \n\nIf you could explain your use case a little it would help in understanding why you need to use these two features together.\n\nJoel\n ",

            "content": "Sure. Our client requires that only one search result per product group be displayed on the search results page. So a red and a blue ipod would be collapsed to the most relevant result of the two. This is what we have been using the collapsing parser for since you created it. \n\nSome time after that was implemented, the client asked for a search results page that shows products grouped by product type. The results are still collapsed the same way as before, but then they are grouped by product type and displayed in different sections of the page. For example, a single page with a section for all the Merchandise and a section for all the Gift Cards. So if the user typed in \"bestbuy\", he would see a single page rendered with matching merchandise in one section and matching gift cards in another.\nThis is the functionality we have in production today.\n\nNow the client is asking to not only to collapse the results as normal but on mouse hover, show all the variations that were collapsed. So in our previous example, the red ipod would be the only result but when the user hovered over it, they would see both the red and blue ipod product details. We intended to use the expand component for this since it fits the use case very well except for the cases where the response is grouped.  ",

The thing that needs to be done is to understand why Grouping either doesn't use the DocList or is putting it in a different place. Other components, like Highlighting also use the DocList, so it might be interesting to know if/how they interact with Grouping.\n\nI personally am pretty swamped for the near future, so I won't have too much time to dig deeper.
