    "description": "I need to be able to use a variable for a password when also using encryptKeyFile.\n\nFor instance:\n\n\t<dataSource\n\t\tdriver=\"${custom.dataimporter.datasource.driver}\"\n\t\turl=\"${custom.dataimporter.datasource.url}\"\n\t\tuser=\"${custom.dataimporter.datasource.user}\"\n\t\tpassword=\"${custom.dataimporter.datasource.password}\"\n\t\tencryptKeyFile=\"/opt/solr/credentials/encrypt.key\"\n\t/>\n\n\n\nBecause I need to change certain variables based on the environment. I'd start like this:\n\n\n     -a\n      -Dcustom.dataimporter.datasource.driver=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver\n      -Dcustom.dataimporter.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://local.mysite.com:3306/mysite\n      -Dcustom.dataimporter.datasource.user=root\n      -Dcustom.dataimporter.datasource.password=U2FsdGVkX1/dqwTb8RBfFq82SM37DkDRGeWMOndftHY=\n\n\n\nIf I hardcode the password, it works; if I use a variable reference, it doesn't.\n\nAs far as I know this pull request was submitted to address this issue, but it didn't come with a Jira ticket or a full explanation.\n\nAlso, note that I'm not using a variable for the value of encryptKeyFile, because it's not possible in 5.x, though it seems to be fixed in 6.1. Presumably, the above patch would encompass encryptKeyFile's value, as well.",
