            "content": "For reasons that I covered in my reply to your solr-user message, I think ZK should remain in a separate process.\n\nI am all for creating a system where the user never has to know anything about zookeeper configuration to get a fault-tolerant cloud up and running.  I agree with Yonik's message on the list where he talks about the difference between internal complexity and difficulty for the user.\n\nMy most recent comment on SOLR-9635 discusses an idea related to this that will require substantial work to realize, but would create a very easy user experience.
