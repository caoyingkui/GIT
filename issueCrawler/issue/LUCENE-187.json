    "description": "This patch includes two small performance improvements:\n\n1. switch from Hashtable to HashMap and preset the capacity to avoid resizing the HashMap (barely \nmeasurable improvement, but easy).\n\n2. add a new Analyzer.tokenStream() method that takes a String instead of a Reader, and call this from \nwithin DocumentWriter.invertDocument().  This allows subclasses of Analyzer to provide a more \nefficient tokenizer for Strings.  (The default implementation just uses a StringReader.)\n\nI was able to write a variant on LowercaseAnalyzer (not included) that's about 10% faster for my dataset.  \nIt works by converting the entire field value with String.toLowerCase() and then using String.substring() \nto extract the string for each token.  This avoids allocating individual char[] arrays inside String for each \ntoken, because String.substring() shares its char[] array with the original.",
