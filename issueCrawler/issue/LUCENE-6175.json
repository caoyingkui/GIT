    "description": "I found j-morph which is an java implementation of hunspell. Here it is: https://code.google.com/p/j-morph/   I know it has a terrible source code but somehow it works much better than Lucene's hunspell implementation. \n\nI used the same hungarian aff and dic file (j-morph contains it) but j-morph produced much better results.  \n\nI will be really impressed If it could work as good as j-morph does. Now sadly I cant accept current Lucene's hunspell implementation. I really like hunspell please improve it as much as possible",
