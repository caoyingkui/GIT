    "description": "As noted by Tomas in SOLR-10835, since the numeric FooPointField classes use SortedNumericDocValues, the docvalues don't \"dedup\" when the same value exists multiple times for a single document \u2013 this is different from the numeric TrieFooField classes that use SortedSetDocValues - which are by definition a set \u2013 so multiple instances of the same value are de-duplicated.\n\nThis impacts things like the ExportWriter, as well as fields that useDocValuesAsStored=\"true\" if users have particular expecations when converting from Trie fields to Point fields.",
