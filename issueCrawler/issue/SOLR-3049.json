    "description": "solrconfig.xml file has an option to override certain UIMA runtime\nparameters in the UpdateRequestProcessorChain section.\n\nThere are certain UIMA annotators like RegexAnnotator which define\n\"runtimeParameters\" value as an Array which is not currently supported\nin the Solr-UIMA interface.\n\nIn java/org/apache/solr/uima/processor/ae/OverridingParamsAEProvider.java,\nprivate Object getRuntimeValue(AnalysisEngineDescription desc, String\nattributeName) function defines override for UIMA analysis engine\nruntimeParameters as they are passed to UIMA Analysis Engine.\nruntimeParameters which are currently supported in the Solr-UIMA interface are:\n String\n Integer\n Boolean\n Float\n\nI have made a hack to fix this issue to add Array support. I would\nlike to submit that as a patch if no one else is working on fixing\nthis issue.",
