So to remove the need for IndexDocValues, lets:\n\n\n\tMove ValueType to FieldType.  FieldType is the appropriate place for that kind of metadata.  This forces the user to define the ValueType of their DocValues when they initialize the FT.\n\tRemove PerFieldDocValues docValues() from Field as its implicit when you consider the ValueType in combination with the actual value.\n\tChange DocValuesConsumer to consume an IndexableField.  It'll be responsible for then creating the PerFieldDocValues by looking at the ValueType.\n\n\n\nWhen we get round to introducing StorableField/Type, the DocValues ValueType will go over to StorableFieldType, more closely aligning DocValues and traditional value storing.

Maybe\nstatic methods like NumericField.newIntValueField(17) and\nBinaryField.newFixedValueField(bytes) for example...\n\nI'll open a new issue about accidentally adding same DV field twice... ",
