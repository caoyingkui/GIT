    "description": "org.apache.solr.common.SolrInputDocument has only single default constructor.\nSince it's a LinkedHashMap, it's initialised with default initialCapacity=16 and loadFactor=0.75.\nThat produces bad performance in situations when your document contains 10000+ different fields.\n\norg.apache.solr.common.SolrInputDocument class needs to have a constructor that allows to specify initialCapacity and loadFactor arguments.",
