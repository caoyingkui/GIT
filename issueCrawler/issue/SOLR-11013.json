I don't want to type curl localhost:8983/v2/collections/mycoll/select?q=foo which is 10 keystrokes more than needed with v1 api... With /v2/c it will remain same length as today. Let's instead remove the /v2/collections variant? ",

If it was a different concept with a different (less common) first initial, things would be different.  But as is, \"c\" is pretty overloaded as an abbreviation.\n\nIf people are still unhappy with that, there is a third option: choose a less ambiguous but still concise abbreviation.  coll is one option: it's harder to confuse with other Solr \"c\"s, and saves you 6 characters over \"collection\".
