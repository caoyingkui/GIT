Request (json facet part) looks like this:\n\n\"facet\" : {\n  \"availabledates\" : { \n     \"field\" : \"departuredate\",\n     \"type\" : \"terms\",\n     \"limit\" : 100,\n     \"facet\" : { \n        \"card\" : \"hll(accommodationid)\"\n     }\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn the example, term facet is calculated for the date field (departuredate) and then hll function is used to get the number of unique values for accommodationid field for each date bucket. And this is indeed equivalent of grouped facet. ",
