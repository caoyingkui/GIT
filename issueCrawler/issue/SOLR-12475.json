            "content": "This test was failing intermittently because it was checking the tlog file sizes on disk after hard commits were automatically triggered. This was problematic because a triggered hard commit gets scheduled for some point (soon) in the future, so the check was not always guaranteed to succeed. Have changed this to check the current tlog object's stream size directly. ",
