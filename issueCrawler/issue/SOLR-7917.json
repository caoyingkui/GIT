            "content": "OK, whew, I think I found it... false alarm.\nThe code in question was only being hit during warming.  So invalid DocSet creation would cause the test to fail, but when I added assertions to catch the issue, it would cause the warming to fail (and we only log exceptions, including assertions during warming since they don't belong to any user request).  The failed warming actually helped the test pass (because there was not a bad DocSet being cached).\n\nI guess one takeaway would be that perhaps we want a way to fail tests if there were any failures during warming.
