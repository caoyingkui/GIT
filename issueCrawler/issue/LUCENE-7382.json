We have the \"generic\" one for all use cases of AttributeFactory, where we don't handle with Tokens, e.g. FuzzyQuery's term enums or other use cases. And there are many!\n\nThe Token-specific one is just more efficient memory and speed-wise for TokenStreams - and because of that it is defined there. It just optimizes the case of standard token attributes like term, offsets, positions,... Otherwise it inherits/delegates to the default - so we still need the default. "
