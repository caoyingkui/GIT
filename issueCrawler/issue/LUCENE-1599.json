All others are using the first IndexSearcher's rewrite queries.\nSo many terms are missing and return unexpected result.\n\nBillow",

I wanted to just test a fix to if that was right, but SpanNearQuery can contain any span queries, so I guess all of them might need clone impls and we may have to clone the whole chain?\n\nA little tired to think about it at the moment  Looks like the issue is with the cloning in SpanNearQuery though.
