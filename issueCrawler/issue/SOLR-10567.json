    "description": "While trying to do faceting on a daterangefield, I noticed that only the SimpleFacets system worked - JSON facets did not allow it.  It was expecting any range facet to be done on a TrieField, which DateRangeField is not.  I updated the code to simply allow DateRangeField through as well, and this appears to work just fine, so I'm submitting a patch so this can be included in the next release.\n\nHaven't submitted a patch before so please forgive me if I screwed up, tried to follow directions as best I could.",
