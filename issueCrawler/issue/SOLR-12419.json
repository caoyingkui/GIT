            "content": "General java coding standards say constants should be all uppercase.  But a quick check shows that this is not what we've done with our Logger objects ... and I think it's more than a little bit of a stretch to describe the logger object as a constant.  It's static and final, but doesn't have the same role as fields that truly can be described as constants, like Integer.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo ... I think an all-lowercase name makes the most sense, and standardizing on it will have a much smaller patch.  A case-sensitive search for \"Logger log\" in master turns up 623 matches, while a similar search for \"Logger LOG\" only turns up 85.  Interestingly, most of the places it's found are in solr/core, not solr/contrib, with a few in solr/solrj.\n\nThe lowercase search did turn up a few usages in Lucene code of java.util.Logger.  That class is available in the JRE, so it doesn't violate the \"no dependency\" requirement that Lucene tries to adhere to, but I still wonder if maybe it doesn't belong there. ",
