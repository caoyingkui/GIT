I can work on the wiki part if you'd like.\n\nAre backups made in the same format as the scripts method (eg can I basically steal that info from the scripts wiki page?)\n\nIs it possible to replicate a backup or just the live index?\n\nI also want to put in what happens when you shutdown during a replication - does Solr wait? Abort? If its aborts, are the temp files cleaned up later?\n\nreplicate and polling both to default to on right?\n\nand the replicate setting just stops any slaves hitting a master with replicate=off from syncing?

            "content": "Lets also clearup the doc for this stuff as part of the issue....\n\nyes the wiki has to be cleaned up too\n\nAre backups made in the same format as the scripts method\n\nThe format is same (same dir name format). The mechanism is different. scripts use hard links , this uses copying\n\nIs it possible to replicate a backup or just the live index?\n\nnope. only live index can be transferred. The backup can be made the live index and then the user can replicate it. There is a file called index.properties in the dataDir (only created by replicationhandler. but users can create them too ). It can take a property index=<dir-name> which tells solr core where to load the index from. users can edit that and do a reload core for the new backup to be used as the index.\n\n\n\nwhat happens when you shutdown during a replication - does Solr wait? Abort? If its aborts, are the temp files cleaned up later?\n\nreplication is aborted. temp files will remain as is. They will not be cleaned up automatically. But presence of those temp files will not have any impact of future replication. \n\nreplicate and polling both to default to on right?\n\nyes\n\nand the replicate setting just stops any slaves hitting a master with replicate=off from syncing?\n\nthe slaves will keep polling even if the master has disabled replication . But the master will respond with \"no changes\" .This will ensure that when the replication is re-enabled from master , the slaves will be able to resume replication \n\n "
