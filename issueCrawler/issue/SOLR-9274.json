You can subscribe here:\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html Lots more eyes are on that list and you'll probably get an answer more quickly.\n\nWhen you ask there, include all your configurations (this is just the component, not the associated handler) and the exact steps you followed (for instance, did you build the suggester?).\n\nHere's a longer example of suggester configuration:\nhttps://lucidworks.com/blog/2015/03/04/solr-suggester/\n ",
