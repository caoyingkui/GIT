I'm inclined to remove it since it would seem to be dependent on the domain?\n\nfurther, it doesn't look like the code would actually round up as the comments describe:\n\nreturn Math.round(val * 10) / 10.0; // round up to 1 decimal place\n\n ",

As an example:\n'74.7'!='74.66666666666667'\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure if the numerical methods used here are that unstable (squaring big things can tend to swamp smaller contributions), or if there is another bug somewhere that the rounding was obscuring.
