    "description": "The top-level ant default task runs test, which is confusing. Instead it should alias \"-projecthelp\". This is easily possible with a trick: invoke ant's main class with <java fork=\"false\"/>.\n\nSolr has a good default task, it may also use the same trick, but I don't care here.\n\nLucene's default task is jar-core... Maybe move the above task to common-build.xml and let all default targets depend on \"-projecthelp\" task from common-build.xml?",
