See the comment. \n\nI am nervous if this is a hidden bug in solr that could be affect other stuff. If a UninvertedField.doNegative() handles deleted documents in a wrong way and you are able to create a filter out of it, it could lead to wrong results, if the filter is applied down-low (random access).
