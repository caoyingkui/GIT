    "description": "Currently the search Streaming Expression doesn't properly support paging even when going to the /select handler. This is due to very old implementation decisions that were geared towards supporting streaming entire result sets from the /export handler. It's time to change this behavior the so the search expression can be used to handle typical paging scenarios.\n\nThis ticket will maintain the same behavior for when qt=/export, but will push down 'rows' and 'start' parameters when using /select handler.",
