    "description": "As we often need to update backwards tests together with trunk and always have to update the branch first, record rev no, and update build xml, I would simply like to do a svn copy/move of the backwards branch.\n\nAfter a release, this is simply also done:\n\nsvn rm backwards\nsvn cp releasebranch backwards\n\n\n\nBy this we can simply commit in one pass, create patches in one pass.\n\nThe snowball tests are currently downloaded by svn.exe, too. These need a fixed version for checkout. I would like to change this to use svn:externals. Will provide patch, soon.",

No extra folder like now in between, so it looks like \"/backwards/src/...\". After a release, one would first \"svn rm\" the old and then \"svn copy\" the src folder of the previously created release branch to trunk. I would add this to the release todo.\n\nOn this change, all committers must first manually do a operating-system \"rm -rf\" on the backwards folder by calling \"ant clean-backwards\" before svn up. Maybe create a patch before  ",
