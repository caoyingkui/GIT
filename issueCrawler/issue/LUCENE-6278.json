    "description": "At the moment, Scorer.freq() does different things depending on the Scorer implementation:\n\n\n\tTermScorer and the phrase scorers return the frequency of that term or phrase in the current document.  TermScorer.freq() is not actually called anywhere (apart from in a couple of tests), and XPhraseScorer.freq() is only called in PhraseWeight.explain()\n\tThe various Boolean scorers return the number of matching subscorers, and are used for coord calculations.\n\n\n\nI think this is confusing.  I propose that we instead add a new coord() method to Scorer that by default returns 1, and that is overridden by the boolean scorers; and that we just remove freq() entirely.  PhraseWeight.explain() can call a package-private method on XPhraseScorer.",

This is like a 1970s horror only for the default similarity and it should not be in all scorer apis, just booleanscorer. it can handle these things another way...\n\nThis would be good, since we could just remove freq().
