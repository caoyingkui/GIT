So people see at least something when look at the examples. If folks want more, they just need to download and extract the files to testdata and run the importer again.\n\nConcerning jscalendar:\n\nYep, forgot about that. It was used as a showcase for what such a widget may look like. There are some jquery calendar plugins out there with different complexity, I'll have a look at their potential for an integrated calendar widget. For people writing demo/non commercial things, we can leave the jscalendar plugin available at solrstuff.org. "

As I rearranged the directory structure to fit our emerged needs, I attach a whole new contrib/javascript dir in the new zip file. I tried to create a suitable patch to current trunk, but as a lot of directories moved, binary files were added and deleted, it got complicated. \n\nI did the following:\n\n\n\tSplit the example to \"core\" and \"reuters\"\n\tThe \"core\" examples work out of the box with existing solr testdata, just run the server in solr/example as usual and open the files in the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\tI removed the reuters src data files, leaving one sample with less than 100 rows. A script is attached so uers may automatically get the full dataset on purpose.\n\tFor the reuters schema, only the solr config dir is provided and the standard example dist is used, pointing to the contrib javascript solr home.\n\tI attached the source code of my reuters importer, removed all unnecessary dependencies (as this was a standalone maven project before). So now a single class with only deps to the standard solr distribution works.\n\n\n\nSo to start the demo app:\n\n\n\tant example in solr root\n\tant dist in contrib/javascript\n\tant reuters-start in contrib/javascript to start the server\n\tant reuters-import to import the data (sample file or all files when downloaded before)\n\n\n\n\nI think this new structure covers the thoughts that came up in this thread, the core examples can be used without doing the more complex reuters stuff, and the full demo can be used with 2 ant commands.

Lucene's contrib/benchmark uses reuters data also, so probably no problem there.\n\nLucene does not include the data, it has a download mechanism for it.  I don't think we should include any Reuters data in SVN or a release.  The license says the data is explicitly for research purposes.  That is somewhat murky to me.  I suppose you could argue a demo is for research (i.e. researching whether it works or not) but I don't think that is the intent of the license given the circumstances and the people who released it.  However, I'm not a lawyer.  For a definitive answer we should either ask Dr. Lewis, but I suspect it is just easier to remove that one file and have the demo be based on the download.  The download is fast, as the doc set is small. "
