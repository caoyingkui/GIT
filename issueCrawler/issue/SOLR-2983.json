    "description": "As part of a recent upgrade to Solr 3.5.0 we encountered an error related to our use of LinkedIn's ZoieMergePolicy.\n\nIt seems the code that loads a custom MergePolicy was at some point moved into SolrIndexConfig.java from SolrIndexWriter.java, but as this code was copied verbatim it now contains a bug:\n\n    try {\n      policy = (MergePolicy) schema.getResourceLoader().newInstance(mpClassName, null, new Class[]\n{IndexWriter.class}\n, new Object[]\n{this}\n);\n    } catch (Exception e) \n{\n      policy = (MergePolicy) schema.getResourceLoader().newInstance(mpClassName);\n    }\n\n'this' is no longer an IndexWriter but a SolrIndexConfig, therefore the call to newInstance will always throw an exception and the catch clause will be executed. If the custom MergePolicy does not have a default constructor (which is the case of ZoieMergePolicy), the second attempt to create the MergePolicy will also fail and Solr won't start.",
