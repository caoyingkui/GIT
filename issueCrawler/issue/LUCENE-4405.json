            "content": "Hi Radhakrishna,\nthe reason for this error is generally one of the following:\n\n\tYou try to create a new index in a non-empty directory. If one of the files looks like a index file name it is taken into account. Use an empty directory for new indexes.\n\tYou try to open an existing index, where non-lucene files are placed in it. The above filename looks like a cloned file (e.g. by pressing Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V in your file manager) causing this Exception. Clean up your index directory by removing the file that contains the above pattern from the Exception message - or recreate the index. File names are part of the Lucene index structure, so foreign names violate the \"file format\" (in our case it is more a directory format).\n\n\n\nI would say this is wont fix for Lucene 3.x, but in Lucene trunk/4.x we should revisit this code and maybe rethrow the NumberFormatException as CorruptIndexException with the full file name and explanation (the above message only shows part of the file).
