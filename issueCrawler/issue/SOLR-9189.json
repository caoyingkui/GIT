            "content": "My initial gut paranoia skimming the jenkins emails this morning was to assume that this might be because of SOLR-9107 / SOLR-5776 \u2013 the hypothosis being: \"The increased randomized use of ssl (factoring in tests.nightly / tests.multiplier) is causing more tests to slow down due to the crypto calculations\"\n\n... but that hypothosis seems weak when i started looking at the logs \u2013 there is a \"Randomized ssl\" line as part of the logs for every SolrTestCaseJ4 subclass showing if ssl is being used or not...\n\n\n\thttp://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-6.x-Linux/834/\n\t\n\t\t25 test failures\n\t\tonly 7 of those were using ssl\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-NightlyTests-master/1034/\n\t\n\t\t44 test failures\n\t\tonly 17 of those were using ssl\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n...even if we assume every test failure where ssl was in use was directly caused by ssl, that still leaves a really high increase in the number of failed tests in those two runs.\n\nSo my ammended (paranoid) hypothosis is \"The increased randomized use of ssl (factoring in tests.nightly / tests.multiplier) is causing more tests to slow down due to the crypto calculations EVEN IN OTHER TESTS AT THE SAME TIME DUE TO CPU STARVATION\"\n\nI'm going to commit a blanket disable of all SSL randomization on master ASAP to test this hypothosis.\n\nPart of me feels like this is an overkill reaction, and that a more rational response would simply be to undo the \"increased odds of using ssl\" portion of SOLR-9107 \u2013 but I'd really like to get a difinitive understanding of wether SSL usage is really having such a seriously pronounced affect on other tests in the same jenkins run \u2013 OR \u2013 is it just a red herring, and some other recent change has caused serious timeout issues?\n\n\nEDIT: clarified jira refrences ",
