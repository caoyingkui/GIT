I have no idea if/whether it uses jquery or, if so, what version though.\n\nI suppose the other question I have is whether we should continue to ship velocity or deprecate/remove it? I have no strong feelings either way but thought the question worth asking. It used to be about the only way to get something up and running quickly, but that's changed over the last 10 years. ",

On the other hand, the Solr example using it demonstrates something we do not really explain/demonstrate in other ways (plugin-style resources loading, etc). For a while I thought we should migrate to https://www.thymeleaf.org/\u00a0but I am no longer sure the server-side in-Solr framework is the right approach. ",
