    "description": "I would like to use sub-facets to create a contigency table. But I am under the impression that the current implementation always returns the top sub facet values per bucket. This is not what I am looking for. I need the distribution of the same global top values of the sub-facets in each facet backet. I think that it is actually easier that what is implemented. Is there a way to get this behavior now? Could we put it on the roadmap?",
