            "content": "This should be a fairly simple ticket, but one minor detail.\nNow that child documents are stored as SolrDocument and SolrInputDocument's fields(SOLR-12631), there could be a case where a field is passed in to the child document return fields, but does not meet constraints for the parent query's return fields, causing the child field to be removed from the final response. e.g:\n\n\"fl\", \"id, child_doc_field, [child fl='id, name_s']\"\n\n\nThis particular field list parameter would cause the removal of name_s from the child document when the response is written. e.g.\n\n{\"id\": 1, \"child_doc_field\": {\"id\": 2}}\n ",

            "content": "Thanks for the improvement!\n\nRE one minor detail:  Oh, interesting.  This should be a documented limitation of child's new \"fl\".  Perhaps it's something that could be solved by having the document writing code not enforce ReturnFields at that time, instead letting earlier stages bear that responsibility.  That can be left for another time; it needn't be addressed here.\n\nI reviewed your PR.  One thing I forgot to mention was to update the appropriate Solr Ref Guide file on this new parameter.\n\nBTW this issue should be a standalone issue, not a sub-task as I think it's a straight-forward improvement to existing functionality.  But it's not a big deal and it can't be changed after the fact without recreating the issue, which isn't worth it here. ",
