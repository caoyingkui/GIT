    "description": "I'm just a git newbie so I'm not sure how to add this to our release scripts, but I think it's quite important that we don't up and release something the world containing changes I had only committed locally and then failed to push.  What if I then remove that directory after we've released?\n\nWe should also fix the release smoke tester to confirm the git revision is known ... I'll open a separate issue for that.\n\nI'm trying to be super careful not to do this for 5.5.0, but really the release script should catch this.\n\nI did a bit of googling and found the magic command git cherry -v origin/branch_5_5 seemed to work (at least, it showed my one local commit), but e.g. \"origin\" is just a label I use (others use \"upstream\"), etc., so I'm not sure how to reliably do this... maybe we have to run git remote -v and figure out what label use use for the \"official\" (wip) Apache git instance?",
