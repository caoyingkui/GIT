    "description": "Currently, the IndexSolrSpellChecker and DirectSolrSpellChecker can have a maxEdits value of 1 or 2, which means that a maximum of 2 edits will be performed on the query before giving up on finding correct terms.\n\nThis works fine for simple words, but when the users are searching for a complete sentence, there can be more than 2 errors, especially on languages like French where accents are frequently ignored while typing a query.\n\nTo correct this problem, we would need to specify a higher maxEdits value. An alternative approach would be to have a value named maxEditsPerWord or something like that.",
