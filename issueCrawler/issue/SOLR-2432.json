    "description": "Using 4.0 trunk version as of 3/16/2011\n\nNot sure at which point in the 4.0 trunk did this problem happen but this did not happen in previous versions.\n\nSymptom:\n\n1) Assume you have a search db with a query for \"love\" that returns 500 results.\n2) Append \"&sort=anyfield desc\" to the search query and you now only get 1 result back.\n\nI even rebuilt the db from scratch to make sure it was not a corrupted solr db but that is not the case.\n\nTemporary Fix:\n\n1) Append \",score desc\" to the \"sort\" value such as \"&sort=anyfield desc,score desc\" fixes the issue and gives back the correct result.",

I had it enabled and experienced the same behavior as Xing, yet as Erik observed the examples worked fine.  Xing's example had the option enabled while the examples do not.  Disabling that option made sorting work as expected. "
