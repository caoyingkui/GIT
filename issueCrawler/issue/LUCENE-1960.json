Do they behave as before?\n\nedit\n\nFrom the patch I see that you also removed the bitmask for testing compression in index format. So an index with compressed fields from 2.9 should behave undefined. In my opinion, support for reading compressed fields should stay available, but not for writing. And: as soon as segments are merged, they should get silently uncompressed (what should be no problem if the special FieldForMerge is no longer used).\n\nAlso the constant bitmask for compression should stay \"reserved\" for futrure use.

That'd make <=2.9 indexes suddenly bigger.\n\nIf we re-add support for compressed fields, we have to also provide the special FieldForMerge again. To get rid of this code (which is the source of the problems behind the whole COMPRESS problem), we could simply let it as it is now without FieldForMerge. If you merge two segmets with compressed data then, without FieldToMerge it gets automatically decompressed and written in uncompressed variant to the new segment. As compressed fields are no longer supported, this is the correct behaviour. During merging, the compress bit must be removed.\n\nThe problem are suddenly bigger indexes, but we should note this in docs: \"As compressed fields are no longer supported, during mering the compression is removed. If you want to compress your fields, do it yourself and store it as binary stored field.\"\n\nJust for confirmation:\nI have some indexes with compress enabled (for some of the documents, since 2.9 we do not compress anymore, newly added docs have no compression anymore [it was never an good idea because of performance]). So I have no possibility to get these fields anymore, because I do not know if they are compressed and cannot do the decompression myself.

The test fails currently on trunk (as expected) and passes with the latest patch.\n\nHowever, there's one issue here: the compressed field gets silently uncompressed during merge, only if in the less efficient merge mode that doesn't use FieldsReader#rawDocs() and FieldsWriter#addRawDocuments(). So now this doesn't sound like a great solution that we sometimes uncompress the fields automatically and sometimes don't. \n\nI think we have three options:\n1. Change FieldsWriter#addRawDocuments() to uncompress on-the-fly\n2. Revert the FieldForMerge changes too and never uncompress automatically during merge\n3. Make it possible for the user to uncompress fields with CompressionTools, no matter which UTF format the data was stored with\n\nI don't really want to do 1., because it will have a performance impact for all fields (you have to look at the field bits even in raw merge mode). With 2. we will have to keep most of the compress/uncompress code in Lucene until 4.0, we'll just not make it possible anymore to add Store.COMPRESS fields with 3.0 (that's already how trunk is). For 3. we'd have to add a deprecated isCompressed() method that the user can call. ",

Can you open a new issue?  I would think IW can drop such a segment immediately (ie not wait for a merge or optimize) on flushing new deletes. ",

Best to also carry forward the code that generated the back compat index, though in this since COMPRESS is removed, you'll have to comment it out w/ a comment stating \"this was used in 2.9 to create field XXX\".
