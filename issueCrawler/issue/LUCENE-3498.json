This is way way expert so I don't expect a lot of people use this feature. to open a reader you can then add some static factories in your own code? ",

For people who use this, the factory system is a lot more user friendly than subclassing.\n\nA protected method in IW doesn't take into account opening a DR from a DR, to do that please commit LUCENE-3497.  If that gets in, we can open an issue to add a protected method to IW. ",
