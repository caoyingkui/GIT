We should either change implementations or introduce a way to optionally select a hyper-log-log based approach for a better estimate with high field cardinalities.",

            "content": "A new paper published in January introduced a new cardinality estimation algorithm called LogLog-Beta/\u03b2:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02284\n\n\"The new algorithm uses only one formula and needs no additional bias\ncorrections for the entire range of cardinalities, therefore, it is more\nefficient and simpler to implement. Our simulations show that the accuracy\nprovided by the new algorithm is as good as or better than the accuracy\nprovided by either of HyperLogLog or HyperLogLog++.\"\nSome comments about its accuracy (graphs included) can be found in this PR: https://github.com/antirez/redis/pull/3677 ",
