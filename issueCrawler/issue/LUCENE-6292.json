    "description": "The current code is good, it avoids SecureRandom/blocking when we don't need real security (just used for safety checks). \n\nOn the other hand it has some downsides: \n\n\tthe sources of randomness here aren't the best, e.g. sysprops will be the same when using automated deployment tools if the jvm is the same version, installed in the same place, same user, etc.\n\tasking for a Properties of all the sysprops needs blanket read-write access to all of them, which is inconvenient if you want to lock this down in tests (which I do). Today this means you can't ban write access or lucene won't work.\n\n\n\nI think we should use /dev/urandom when its available, its just practical and exactly what we need. If its not available (e.g. windows) we can use the current logic. If sysprops arent available we can just use another hashcode instead and lucene can still be used.",

            "content": "i never realized this \"psuedo-randomness\" id generating code existed until today ... it definitely seems like it could easily contributed to hard to reproduce test failures between multiple machines \u2013 but if i'm reading this right, at least prior to this patch the same JVM, with the same command line args should produce a consistent sequence of ids .... correct?\n\nBut with this patch even that level of \"same machine, same JVM args\" reproducibility goes away doesn't it?\n\nwould be be worthwhile to make this static init code try, as a first attempt, to read the \"tests.seed\" system property, and if it's set then use a hashcode of that string to seed everything else (superceeding /dev/urandom, the sysprops, nanoTime, etc...) \n\nWouldn't that give us best of all worlds: more (reproducible) randomness in JVMs running tests, and more randomness in non-test applications.
