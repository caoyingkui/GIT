            "content": "This reads much smoother to me.\n\n\n A few nit pick suggestions...\n\n\tI would move the \"Using an exact integer value for count constraints is of limited utility...\" info box until the end of the bulleted list, and add a sentence to it giving an equivilent example of a better alternative using percentages. ie: give people the full (uninterupted) list of legal expressions, including both integer constants and percentages, then explain why % is better then absolute.\n\tthe idea of \"minimizing violations\" is already mentioned elsewhere, but I would add a sentence to the section on strict mentioning it again since that's where it's particularly pertinent. End with something like...\nIf multiple rules declared to be `strict:false` can not be satisfied by some nodes, then a node will be chosen such that the number of such violations are minimized.\n\tThe section \"Manual Collection Creation with a Policy\" is really just a large iterative example \u2013 not \"instructional reference\" content like other sections w/equivalent header levels ... perhaps rename \"Example: Manual Collection Creation using Policies\" ?\n\n ",
