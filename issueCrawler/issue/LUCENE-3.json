    "description": "Hi. I am using a cvs version of Lucene (got on 2001.10.11).\n\nI am having the following problem: while I can achieve case insensibility of the\nsearch engine by using the correct tokenizer (a derivative of\nLowerCaseTokenizer, which passes alphanumeric characters instead of letters only\nas token components), I cannot have this feature work with prefix queries.\n\nAs I am currently working on the problem myself, I can submit a solution fixing\nthis bug in some future.",

It could be true by default.\n\nWould that suffice? ",
