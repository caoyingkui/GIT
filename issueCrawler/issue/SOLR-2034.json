            "content": "+1 to the patch\n\nMy only concern is upgrade compatibility \u2013 it would be preferable if people upgrading either Solr or their SolrJ client (but not both at the exact same moment) would still have a functioning system.\n\nAs i recall, the BinaryResponseWriter / Parser use a version param and version metadata in the response (just like the XmlResponseWriter) to indicate the codec version requested and the code version returned \u2013 this seems like the kind of thing that should probably warrant a new coden impl with a new version number.\n\nthat said: i didn't follow the details of the binary response writer / parser / codec implementation very closely, so i have no idea how hard it will be to make it all work smoothly for people: if it's a pain in the ass then i'm totally fine with saying that SolrJ 3.x can't talk to Solr 1.x (and vice versa) ... but we should still probably update the binary code version info to make it clear there is a difference "

I know its likely a work in progress etc, but I think it illustrates the benefits of standard UTF-8.\n "

Note that that does not mean people can not use solrj to talk across different versions - they may have to use xml though....\n\nAgreed, my chief concern is what happens when someone tries to use SolrJ 1.4 to talk to Solr 3.1 w/javabin (or vice versa).\n\nA) If they get an error: great, i'm totaly fine with that \u2013 we just document that they should use XML in this case.\n\nB) If the commands succeed, but the string data is always corrupted, that's not ideal \u2013 but not totally horrible since the probably should be immediately obvious and should have read the documentation and known not to do that.\n\nC) if the commands succeed, but the string data is sometimes corrupted (as i recall, not every character is different in UTF8 vs Java's  modified UTF8, correct?) then that seems really bad ... people may start using javabin to update their index and not notice for quite some time that big hard to identify chunks of their data are corrupted.\n\nas long a someone sanity checks that the situation is either #A or #B before committing, i'm totally cool with it ... but #C scares the bejesus out of me.\n\n(i'll try to run some tests myself in the next few days if no one else gets a chance) "

Its not really possible or reasonable to address it at the javabin layer: it needs to be done at a higher protocol level.\n\nof course, if we can figure this out, then maybe it would be easy to provide back compat too, but i didnt see any obvious places in the code where any versioning is written over the wire.
