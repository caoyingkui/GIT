Try adding autoGeneratePhraseQueries=\"true\" to your text field type (the fieldType, not the field.)\n\nSee SOLR-2015 for details.\n\nThe space is passed properly to the analyzer since it is escaped, but when the analyzer returns more than one term, the query parser is obeying the autoGeneratePhraseQueries option which is now defaulted to not do what you used to see.\n\nJust to clarify, what release of Solr were you using where the query worked as expected?
