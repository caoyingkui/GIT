    "description": "If XMLLoader is used to build SolrInputDocuments Enum values are treated as String values and not as EnumFieldValue like it is done by the binary codec.\n\nSo the doRemove call of AtomicUpdateDocumentMerger will get String values which does not match any EnumFieldValue from the existingField values.\n\nThe behaviour can be tested easily with  the EmbeddedSolrServer because it uses the XML codec to convert the SolrRequest.\n\nJust create a multivalued EnumField add some values and try to remove some with\natomic update calls.\n\nThe values will remain unchanged.",
