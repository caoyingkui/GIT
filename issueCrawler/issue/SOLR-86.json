I'm also not convinced this is really a use case where depending on HttpClient (and all it requires) really makes sense ... if the goal is a simple demonstrative tool then it should have as few dependencies as possible right?\n\nI've been playing arround with your attachment a bit and i've got an alternate version i'd like your feedback on ... for simplicity i left the code in the util package of the main code tree, and modified the main build.xml so that \"ant example\" would create example/post.jar used like so...\n\n   java -jar example/post.jar http://localhost:8983/solr/update example/exampledocs/*.xml\n\nattachment to follow.

I agree with Hoss that the post.sh replacement should use the latter.\n\nIMHO it's good to show the use of HttpClient for people who're going to base more complex clients on it, and a \"no depedencies\" client is useful for simple cases.\n\nMaybe (thinking outloud here) both clients could implement a common SolrUpdateClientInterface, and update+search clients would implement a SolrSearchInterface as well.
