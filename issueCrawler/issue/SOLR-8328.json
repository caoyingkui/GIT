Another is to install the \"devel\" package for your Java version (so the JDK is installed).  The last way is to edit the bin/solr script as shown in the patch that I have uploaded.\n\nOf the three ways to get an immediate fix, I would probably opt for installing the unzip package, because this is a very useful program to have.

Comparing the trunk CHANGES with the 5x CHANGES, I can see a significant number of differences in the 5.4 section (and some sections further down), in addition to the obvious difference of having a 6.0 section that is not present in the latter.  It looks like most of the differences are issue numbers in different places and whitespace differences.\n\nThe way I am inclined to fix this is to make sure that the 5x CHANGES is correct, then simply replace everything after the 6.0 section with the contents of the 5x file.
