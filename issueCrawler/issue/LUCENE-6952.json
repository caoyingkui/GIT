    "description": "I think it's confusing that FilterLeafReader (and it's Filter* inner classes) are not abstract.  By making them abstract, we clarify to users how to use them by virtue of them being abstract.  It seems only a couple tests directly instantiate them.  This applies to other Filter* classes as well.",

But that's debatable; it's fine either way I guess. "

They were there because the very first attempt made some classes Abstract and I had since changed my mind.  A test discovered this. "
