If, through  discussion, we determine that it's a bona-fide code issue, then we can raise a JIRA.\n\nIn this case it's not clear at all that there is any error. For instance, if every doc that mentions magnetic also mentions flux, the results would be what you report.  Solr does not implement strict boolean logic, see:\n\nhttps://lucidworks.com/blog/2011/12/28/why-not-and-or-and-not/\n\nThat said, edismax has had some work done on it lately, have you checked whether a recent 6.x version exhibits the same behavior?
