    "description": "The core \"unload\" button in the UI currently will completely remove a core from solr.xml.  With the implentation of transient cores, there should be a way to ask Solr to unload a core without removing it entirely.\n\nThis leads into a discussion about terminology.  UNLOAD isn't a good single-word description for what it does.  A case could be made for having REMOVE and DELETE actions for CoreAdmin, with confirmation prompts if you click on those buttons in the UI.  DELETE could simply be an option on REMOVE - which I think you can actually currently do with UNLOAD.\n\nAnother idea, not sure if it needs its own issue or is part of this one: If a core is mentioned in solr.xml but not actually loaded, it would be very cool if it were listed, but with a different background color to indicate the non-loaded state.",

            "content": "Still an issue. The unload operation now removes the core.properties file associated with the core, and there's no way to get it back. We might want to retitle this to something like \"revamp the core admin UI\". Personally I'd be in favor of only displaying the core admin API when NOT connected to Zookeeper, but that'd take some discussion as it has implications.\n\nTo support anything like an \"unload\" command we'd need some work, things like \n1> standardize renaming core.properties rather than removing it. Say to core.unloaded\n2> get a list of all the potential cores with core.unloaded rather than core.properties so we could get it back\n3> whatever.....\n\nI suppose wrapped around all of this is whether we want a core admin page at all when we move to Zookeeper as \"the one source of truth\".....\n\n "

I'd suggest changing this to an API ticket rather than a UI one. "
