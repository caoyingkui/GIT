What I discovered was that if I define the properties within a <core/> in solr.xml, they pass all the way to my dih config file!  Awesome.  But if I define them at the <solr/> level, then they do NOT pass all the way.  However, if I do the workaround, then it works.  But again, that is very awkward.\n\nSeems like if I define them at any level, they should pass all the way through. "
