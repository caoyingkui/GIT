I really don't know much about distributed mode, but grepping for \"distrib\" yields all kinds of interesting stuff that's unrelated to the clustering plugin...:\n\nBaseDistributedSearchTestCase:\n    // TODO: look into why passing true causes fails\n    params.set(\"distrib\", \"false\"); \n\n\n\nI'm not sure where to start, to be honest. There is a \"DistributedClusteringComponentTest.java\" and it seems to be passing. The offending line (NPE) happens in \n\nDocListAndSet results = rb.getResults();\nMap<SolrDocument,Integer> docIds = new HashMap<>(results.docList.size());\n\n\n\nso I'm guessing docList is empty (or results). Don't want to dodge the problem (if ... != null) without understanding the cause. ",

            "content": "Hello David,\n\nWe have regular SolrCloud collections using various number of shards. I wouldn't see how our collection's characteristics could mess up.\n\nI know distributed search calls SearchComponent's process() multiple times per request, at different phases, only at the final phase fields are available to do highlighting or clustering on. So i think this component never had support for distributed search in the first place. That doesn't explain DistributedClusteringComponentTest passing though.\n\nTesting for the correct phase, and perhaps even the null check might solve it. Perhaps a committer having experience dealing with SearchComponent and different distributed search phases could chime in on this?\n\nRegards,\nMarkus ",
