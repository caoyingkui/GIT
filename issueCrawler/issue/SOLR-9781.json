    "description": "The jetty configuration files are becoming out of date with what is in current Jetty versions \u2013 even the version that Solr includes.  There's a thread on the mailing list regarding a confusing log message that would have been prevented if webdefault.xml had been kept current.\n\nLooking at master ... the only actual change I can see that we have made in webdefault.xml is to enable gzip.  Master includes Jetty 9.3.8, but its webdefault.xml file has gotten pretty out of date with what Jetty is shipping.  All of the Jetty configuration files should be examined and updated with current defaults from Jetty, plus any actual changes that we have made.  We should probably describe the changes we have made from a stock Jetty download in a text file somewhere, so we can easily refresh the entire configuration when we update Jetty.",
