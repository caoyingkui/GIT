As a workaround, I have to add a MatchAllDocsQuery in order to get it to work.\n\n        BooleanQuery result = new BooleanQuery();\n        result.add(new MatchAllDocsQuery(), BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);\n        result.add(myQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT);\n\nMaybe this is intended???? If so, perhaps the JavaDocs should be updated to indicate this.",
