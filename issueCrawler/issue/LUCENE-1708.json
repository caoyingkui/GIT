Did I miss?\n\nI do see where mike mentions the isDeleted change should happen with deprecation, but this patch appears to just make the change. Our current back compat policy doesn't allow that. It doesn't even really allow the really special exceptions that we have had to make (and I think it should spell that out, as well as our 'experiemental trick'). We have not officially allowed a relaxed back compat policy right?\n\nI'm not trying to police back compat, but I think we need to do our best to live up to it until its officially changed. Having had to make a couple exceptions doesn't mean we can just toss it for this release.\n\nSorry if I missed the relevant discussion on this - didn't see anything in the attached email thread. ",
