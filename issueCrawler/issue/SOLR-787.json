Inspecting my deps with NetBeans' maven dep viewer I don't understand why Solr uses woodstox and SolrJ uses the different artifact (but same jar) org.codehaus.woodstox\n\nAnd according to \n\nhttp://jarvana.com/jarvana/inspect-pom/org/apache/solr/solr-core/1.4.0/solr-core-1.4.0.pom\n\nhttp://jarvana.com/jarvana/inspect-pom/org/apache/solr/solr-solrj/1.4.0/solr-solrj-1.4.0.pom\n\nNetBeans is correct.\n\nThe problem with this is, that you will have two identical jars in the classpath and that the solrj dep forces you to still use stax-api "
