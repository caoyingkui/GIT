    "description": "In the process of testing the pointsOnly flag, I realized RPT's optimization to force the predicate to Intersects from Within|Contains isn't sound.  In the case of Within, this is only valid if there is one point per document but not multiple (since all points on a doc need to intersect the query shape), and for Contains it was simply wrong.  \n\nNote that the strategy has no multi-valued hint or some-such.  If it did, then if !multiValued && pointsOnly, then Within could be changed to Intersects.  Regardless, swapping the predicate can be done at a higher level (Solr/ES).",

            "content": "This patch removes the predicate swap by RPT, and enhances existing randomized testing for pointsOnly.  And it refactored the \"hasIndexedLeaves\" flag (generally !pointsOnly) to be passed through to WithinPrefixTreeFilter and moved it from AbstractVisitingPrefixTreeFilter.VisitorTemplate to its parent class. \n\nIn the process, I fixed a bug in which WithinPrefixTreeFilter was missing equals/hashcode.  It would have only been a problem if you were explicitly creating WithinPrefixTreeFilter with custom buffered query distance args. "
