    "description": "Issues like LUCENE-5628 LUCENE-5659 are hacks around the problem that the AnalyzingSuggester allows automata to \"explode\".\n\nI don't think we should try to hack up the automata lib to the point its un-understandable to support this, since its designed for smaller automata such as queries and is appropriate for that.\n\nWe should instead just set appropriate limits out of box so AnalyzingSuggester doesnt blow up.\n\nRemember this is a suggester, it needs to be fast. The fact that the automata lib blows up on stupid unit tests or whatever are doing this, instead of being silently slow, is a good thing.",
