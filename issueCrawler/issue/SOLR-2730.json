HTML-encoding in the client is not an option since the highlighted snippets then would break.",

This can be controlled with hl.htmlEncodeFallback=true to give the possibility for backwards compat\nB) Include a flag in the highlighting result which says whether fallback has occurred, so client can do something intelligent "
