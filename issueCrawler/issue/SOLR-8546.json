Just define JAVA_OPTS as\n\n -Dtests.seed=373B7C68661497FF -Dtests.slow=true -Dtests.locale=de_AT -Dtests.timezone=Pacific/Norfolk -Dtests.asserts=true -Dtests.file.encoding=US-ASCII\n\n? ",

There are two calls to random.nextint() that look like this\nint blah = random.nextInt(10000);\nsome stuff\nint blort = random.nextInt(blah).\n\nWhenever blah == 0 it throws an error since blah must be positive.\n\nChecking this in, but I'll keep this JIRA open for a while to see if Jenkins is happy as well as beasting it a lot locally.
