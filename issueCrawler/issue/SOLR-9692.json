Ewen Cluley did you have a chance to test it?\n\nJust seeing when testing another issue that the two methods getServletPath and getPathInfo do not always return the same string, so a more reliable way would be to use getRequestURI and check for .endsWith() instead of equals. See this article for reference http://stackoverflow.com/a/21046620/416763\n\nOr perhaps someone can spin up the 6.3 RC and test this by hand, outside the unit tests? I don't have time right now. ",
