Is it possible to remove this method Query.getSimilarity also? I don't understand why we need this method!\n\nI would love to! But I think that's for another day...\n\nI looked into this and got stuck with BoostingQuery, which rewrites to an anon \nsubclass of BQ overriding its getSimilarity in turn override its coord method. \nRather twisted... if we can do this differently I think we could remove Query.getSimilarity.\n\n\n\nhere is the method in question:\n\n\n/** Expert: Returns the Similarity implementation to be used for this query.\n * Subclasses may override this method to specify their own Similarity\n * implementation, perhaps one that delegates through that of the Searcher.\n * By default the Searcher's Similarity implementation is returned.*/\npublic Similarity getSimilarity(IndexSearcher searcher) {\n  return searcher.getSimilarity();\n}",
