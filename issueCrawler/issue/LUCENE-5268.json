    "description": "In LUCENE-5123, we added a new, more flexible, \"pull\" API for writing\npostings.  This API allows the postings format to iterate the\nfields/terms/postings more than once, and mirrors the API for writing\ndoc values.\n\nBut that was just the first step (only SimpleText was cutover to the\nnew API).  I want to cutover more components, so we can (finally)\ne.g. play with different encodings depending on the term's postings,\nsuch as using a bitset for high freq DOCS_ONLY terms (LUCENE-5052).",

For the rest I just switched them to\n    PushPostingsBaseWriter.\n\n\n\n\n\tOnly two PushFieldsConsumers remain: MemoryPF and RAMOnlyPF\n    (test-framework); I'm tempted to just cut those over and then\n    remove PushFieldsConsumer here.\n\n\n\nStill a few nocommits but I think it's close ...
