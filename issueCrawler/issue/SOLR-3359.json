    "description": "I've not been realized that CJKTokenizer and its factory classes was marked deprecated in 3.6/4.0 (the ticket is LUCENE-2906) until someone talked to me.\n\n\n * @deprecated Use StandardTokenizer, CJKWidthFilter, CJKBigramFilter, and LowerCaseFilter instead.           \n\n\n\nI agree with the idea of using the chain of the Tokenizer and TokenFilters instead of CJKTokenizer, but it could be a problem for the existing users of SynonymFilterFactory with CJKTokenizerFactory.\n\nSo this ticket comes to my mind again.",
