    "description": "Bram Van Dam on the user's list had a problem with a bad query causing an exception:\n\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Too many values for UnInvertedField\nfaceting on field text. \n\nThen the query apparently got into one of the caches and was then autowarmed leading to the error every time a new searcher was opened.\n\nThis does not happen with, say, a query that references an undefined field. Such a query doesn't get into the cache in the first place.\n\nI have not been able to verified this but it seems worth a JIRA to investigate at least, no query that throws an exception should get into the caches. You can imagine a situation where this leads to OOM errors and Solr needing to be restarted to get past it.",
