I feel this is a bit dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a process with the start command we could write out a pid file of the solr process that it started. Then the stop script should stop that process.\n\nIt could error out if the pid file is not present.\n\nWe could still keep the feature of stopping all solr nodes by passing passing -all ?",
