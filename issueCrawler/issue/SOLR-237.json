    "description": "This patch include a new feature called \"Field collapsing\".\n\n\"Used in order to collapse a group of results with similar value for a given field to a single entry in the result set. Site collapsing is a special case of this, where all results for a given web site is collapsed into one or two entries in the result set, typically with an associated \"more documents from this site\" link. See also Duplicate detection.\"\nhttp://www.fastsearch.com/glossary.aspx?m=48&amid=299\n\nThe implementation add 3 new query parameters (SolrParams):\n\"collapse\" set to true to enable collapsing.\n\"collapse.field\" to choose the field used to group results\n\"collapse.max\" to select how many continuous results are allowed before collapsing\n\nTODO (in progress):\n\n\tMore documentation (on source code)\n\tTest cases",
