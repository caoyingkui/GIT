So we need to fix that.\n\nHowever, when new deletions have arrived, a new shallow clone must be\ncreated.  In this case the FieldCache entries are shared.\n\nSo, should these other caches share an entry for that clone, or not?\nIt's tempting to do so \u2013 all that's changed is new docs got deleted,\nand any time these filters are applied for searching, they are AND'd\nwith \"not deleted\".\n\nBut, this is technically shaky ground, since the new deletions will in\nfact mean some docs that previously passed the filter (bit was set)\nwill now have the bit un-set.\n\nI would lean towards letting the caches share the filter in these\ncases, and advertising in these classes javadocs that this will\nhappen.
