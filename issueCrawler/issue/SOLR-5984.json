    "description": "The MoreLikeThisHandler, when showing explains output, shows the scoring calculations based upon the rawMLTQuery, not the boostedMLTQuery, meaning that boosts aren't shown in the explains output.\n\nGiven that explains is supposed to \"explain\" the score that was actually used, this is clearly incorrect.\n\nThe fix is a one-liner. Patch to follow.",
