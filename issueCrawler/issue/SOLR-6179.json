            "content": "(fixed description - was in \"enviornment\" by mistake)\n\n\n\nPart of the issue here is that \"No stored data found for...\" message is actually fairly important it most cases \u2013 if you are actively using managed resources (for something like managed synonyms) this WARN log type message is the only thing that will help you catch a possible situation where the storage file got deleted out from under you inadvertantly.\n\nThis is really very similar to the way we currently log a warning on startup if there is not \"index\" directory \u2013 it's an exceptional enough situation that we want to warn you about it so that you can find it in your logs later if things aren't working as you expect \u2013 but as soon as we log that warning we continue with the assumption that it's expected and we should automatically create it for you\n\nThe right solution here is probably:\n\n\n\tAnytime ManageResource sees that no storage exists for something it's managing, it should immediately create an \"empty\" storage for it and log a WARN along the lines of \"No stored data found for /rest/foo/bar/yak .... creating new empty storage\"\n\t\n\t\tThis will mean that as people upgrade from old versions of solr to new versions of solr, they get this WARN exactly once for /rest/managed as the new (empty file is created)\n\t\tIf/when people add new managed analysis factories to their schema.xml, they will likewise get a WARN once as empty storage files are created (even if they restart several times before they PUT any stopwords/synonyms into these managed resources)\n\t\n\t\n\tIn our example configs, just like we ship pre-populated _schema_analysis_stopwords_english.json and _schema_analysis_synonyms_english.json files, we should ship a \"pre-populated\" (ie: empty) _rest_managed.json file\n\t\n\t\twhich would ensure that no new user, who starts fresh with the \"current\" example configs, ever sees a warning about \"No stored data found for /rest/managed\"\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"No registered observers for...\" message seems like something that has no business being a WARN, and should be switched to DEBUG or INFO \u2013 but i may just be missunderstanding the purpose of that message.
