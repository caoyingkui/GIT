            "content": "\n\nSince we moved delete to IndexWriter, I strongly feel that IndexReader SHOULD be always read-only,\nso your patch makes perfect sense to me.\n\nI agree...\n\nIn 3.0, we are switching IndexReader.open to return a readOnly reader\nby default (it's now read/write).\n\n\nI know that there are still some operations that IndexWriter can't do, and real-time search needs them,\nso that's why LUCENE-1516 was created, right? But those guys don't need to open previous commit point,\nthey need latest & greatest, so the patch should work for them too.\n\nRight, once realtime search is released, proves stable, etc.,\nIndexReader should no longer need any write operations (I think?).\n\n\nBut in the end (lucene4, or maybe sooner?), could it be possible to move all modifying methods\nto IndexWriter and let IndexReader to be what it says it is: a READER?\n\nI think LUCENE-1516 won't land until after 3.0 (though, it's making\nfast progress now, so it could be we get initial version into 2.9).\n\nThen sometime in 3.x, we deprecate all write methods in IndexReader\nand add anything missing (setNorm, undeleteAll) into IndexWriter.\n\nThen in 4.x we would remove IndexReader's deprecated methods.\n\nBeside this totally random talk, the patch looks good, I'll try to test it in a day or two and let you know if there are any problems.\n\nExcellent, thanks \u2013 I'll hold off on committing until we hear back\nhow your tests go!
