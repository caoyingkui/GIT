    "description": "In LUCENE-8155 we had to again activate testing with later Java versions in addition to the \"official minimal one\". Unfortunately this code was completely deleted from Java 7/Java  8 times, so I had to revert very old commits and this caused trouble because changed ant targets.\n\nI'd suggest to improve the smoke tester to easily configure multiple JDK instances without hardcoding version numbers (if you want to now switch or add Java 10, you have to touch lots of code).\n\nMy Python knowledge is close to zero, so I open it here for discussion and maybe somebody elsae can help.",
