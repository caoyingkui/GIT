These were failing with this warning:\n\nPERFORMANCE WARNING: Overlapping onDeckSearchers=2\n\n...and the test itself would run before the test data was committed, resulting in failure.\n\nThis problem is re-occurring and needs a better fix.",

I think if I move this to the correct place in the file, this intermittent problem will be solved. ",
