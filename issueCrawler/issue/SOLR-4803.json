    "description": "As far as i can tell, the \"new solr.xml\" changes caused the following problems...\n\n\n\tDEFAULT_DEFAULT_CORE_NAME is not used at all in the \"new\" style solr.xml, but probably should be (at least in 4x)\n\n\n\nSee also the mailing list thread \"[JENKINS] Lucene-Solr-SmokeRelease-4.x - Build # 69 - Failure\" where the lack of using DEFAULT_DEFAULT_CORE_NAME causes the smoke tester to fail on both 4x and trunk because many things assume collectionless URLs will work",

(same reasons as mentioned before: this gets the 4x and trunk example and simple single core cases working again with simple URLs)\n\n\n\nJan: as mentioned, my initial impressions about the impact of this bug were wrong, it really only affects the \"new style\" example on the 4x & trunk branchs, and doesn't seem to really affect anyone using existing \"old style\" solr.xml files.\n "

This wouldn't have affected any upgraders though, and the new style solr.xml stuff has enough problems (you cant use the right data dir specification for solrcloud, core properties are not persisted - a problem for std Solr, broken SolrCloud, a lot of other little bugs) that I'd say you should not use it in 4.3 and I can't see how it will be solid until 4.4. There has already been a lot of work and there is a fair amount more to come, and it's enough churn to make a backport scary - I think the only way is forward.\n\nWhat prompted finding this issue with the smoke tests was shifting the example to use the new style so that we are forced to make it solid ASAP. I'll be contributing some more fixes shortly myself.\n\nSo this issue dones't really contribute to a 4.3.1 release IMO. "
