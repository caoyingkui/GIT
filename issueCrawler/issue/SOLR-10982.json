    "description": "Extracting this idea suggested by Uwe Schindler in SOLR-10803. The proposal is to:\n\n\tEnable DocValues by default for numeric/string/date fields. (SOLR-10808)\n\tHave a merge policy that can generate the DocValues at merge time if a field doesn\u2019t have them but should according to the schema (SOLR-10046). Make this Merge Policy the default.\n\tWhen using an index created with 7.x (maybe using the new metadata added by Adrien Grand recently) and something tries to access FieldCache (e.g. for sorting or faceting or functions), it should fail the query.\n\tRemove FieldCache in 8.0",
