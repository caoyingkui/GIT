    "description": "The exact stats cache doesn't distribute stats due to an restrictive optimization which meant that in some cases document counts (required for IDF) were not being sent back. This caused TF/IDF calculations to be missing some information that leads to differences depending on distribution of documents and terms in shards.",

            "content": "The attached patch demonstrates the problem by adding more exhaustive tests, including disabling caching used in the old ones. The test also improved the information being checked and also removed some of the randomness built into the older tests when creating the indexes by now creating all permutations. It also contains a fix for the problem. There may be alternative approaches to solving this but may require more work in other areas. Additional logging has also been added.\n\nThe patch is against the 5.x branch but should be straightforward to apply to the master. ",
