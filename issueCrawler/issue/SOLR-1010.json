A naive approach will break any existing configs.\n\nI think I would add this to the bucket of things that get fixed in 2.0 with a full re-vamp of how configuration/initialization happens. "

            "content": "I'm a little unclear on why it would ever make sense to base any sort of configuration path on where the container was invoked, because usage of a container implies there might be other colocated apps and resulting conflicts if other apps (which are likely Solr instances) worked in this way. \n\nBut even more so when I've made an obvious effort to override this behavior by using something like JNDI. It seems to me that the type of user that's willing to do the configuration work to set JNDI properties is the type of user that wouldn't need to worry about the simplicity of having all paths work off the invocation directory, and the configured solr.home should be considered the new user.dir.\n\nMaybe I'm missing the other argument because it doesn't apply to me somehow, though.
