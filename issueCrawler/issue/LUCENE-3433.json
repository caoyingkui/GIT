Ie, an app sets this on their \"country\" field because they know they want to sort by \"country\" at search time, and they will load the DV into RAM at search time.  We only hold this RAM allocated while we merge the one field, then it's freed, so if multiple DV sort fields are used, merging takes less RAM than searching.  I think the merge RAM usage is relatively minor.\n\nThe SortedSource has a simple API (just like FC.DocTermsIndex): getOrd(int docID), getValue(int ord).

            "content": "+1 - something contentious should not be removed in an unrelated issue like this. If it's already in, but some want it out, let's make an a new issue to discuss. Once something is in, there should be a clear and dedicated issue discussing it's removal if there is dispute. I don't agree with simply pulling it and putting the onus on those who want it to make an issue to get it back in.\n\nthere is no dispute here If you'd have looked at the API and the code you'd know what I talk about though. We cut over to a new api where sorted source doesn't fit in nicely. We had ValuesEnum used for merging as the LCD between SortedSource and Source. Now we only have Source as a RandomAccess API. To keep this at a reasonable size we should try to add the missing part in a different issue. We should also rethink how to merge sortd sources since they are quite mem heavy (I think this is a potential issue). Adding back SortedSource is going to be tough without a new issue since lots of stuff has changed. To make this dev process easier backing out and re-adding seems best to me. Don't worry we gonna add it back though. ",

I think a lot of this is due to the current API\n\tno offense to simon but i think in a way this forces him to feel responsible for doing all work on it. The complexity makes it hard for others to get involved.\n\twith this patch, the api becomes a lot simpler: i'm sure its not perfect but the API seems to correspond to what DV does, at least it makes sense to me.\n\n\n\ncan we temporarily drop SortedSource, open a new issue to add it back (mark it blocker for 4.0 even?!). This way, we can rethink how to implement this functionality (maybe it doesnt even belong as docvalues but something on top of it, or something else entirely). ",

I added SortedSource back and integrated it into the Source pattern for random access. we now have an entirely disk resident SortedSource impl for both variants and a single interface in the first place. SortedSource instance can be obtained via Source#asSortedSource() which returns null if the source is not sorted. With this random access DirectSortedSource we can also improve the merging for sorted sources which was one of my major issues here. ",
