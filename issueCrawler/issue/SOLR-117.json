Is the external API right?  facet.prefix (and per-field f.cat.facet.prefix)\nI had considered a more generic facet.field.terms=ca*  but Erik's comment about client escaping make me realize it's simpler on both sides to just say \"prefix\".

            "content": "Full patch w/ tests attached.\n\nThis version also implements facet.prefix for the FieldCache method.  It also lowers the memory used per-request for that method (because int[] count is smaller since we know the max number of terms beforehand that match the prefix).  A binary search is used to find the start and end terms for the prefix. "
