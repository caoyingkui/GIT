    "description": "Point FieldTypes can't be Strings in it's \"internal representation\", so calling ft.toInternal(...) is not supported. For those fields we use toInternalByteRef(...) that does the same thing but returns a BytesRef instance instead of a String. In many cases, the consumer of toInternal(...) actually needs (or can optionally use) a BytesRef and we end up creating one from the String. It would be better to have toInternal() return a BytesRef instance, it can be easily converted to a String if needed",
