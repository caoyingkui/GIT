    "description": "Having upper/lower bounds on terms could be useful for various optimizations in the future, e.g. to accelerate sorting (if a segment can't compete, don't even search it), and so on.\n\nIts pretty obvious how to get the smallest term, but the maximum term for a field is tricky, but worst case you can do it in ~ log(N) time by binary searching term space.",

            "content": "Here is a prototype. I think codecs like blocktree could just override and probably get the maximum value in constant time.\n\nThis stuff is probably most useful for numeric fields, but unfortunately they add extra terms, and their termsenums aren't seekable. So maybe NumericUtils.filterPrefixCoded* can be fixed to return \"real\" termsenums rather than FilteredTermsEnum?\n\nFilteredTermsEnum is much less useful in general, its pretty much only good for MultiTermQuery execution.
