    "description": "The Solr Admin Query UI has two query parser check boxes, dismax and edismax, but query parser selection should be one from a list and not permit selection of two query parsers.\n\nI won't design the UI, but a baseline suggestion would be a list of radio buttons: \"Classic Lucene/Solr\", \"Dismax\", \"Edismax\", and \"Other\". \"Other\" would offer an input box where the user could enter an arbitrary query parser name. Or, if the UI can access a full list of the configured query parsers, that list could be offered.",
