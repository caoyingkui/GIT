    "description": "the class org.apache.lucene.search.spell.SpellChecker uses the following hard-coded values in its method\nindexDictionary:\n        writer.setMergeFactor(300);\n        writer.setMaxBufferedDocs(150);\nthis poses problems when the spellcheck index is created on systems with certain limits, i.e. in unix\nenvironments where the ulimit settings are restricted for the user (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47428#47428).\n\nthere are several ways to circumvent this:\n1. add another indexDictionary method with additional parameters:\n    public void indexDictionary (Dictionary dict, int mergeFactor, int maxBufferedDocs) throws IOException\n\n2. add setter methods for mergeFactor and maxBufferedDocs \n    (see code in http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47428#47428 )\n\n3. Make SpellChecker subclassing easier as suggested by Chris Hostetter \n   (see reply  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47463#47463)\n\nthanx,\nkarin",
