    "description": "The French stop words example file that's distributed with Solr (in example/solr/collection1/conf/lang/stopwords_fr.txt) appears to be broken. Most lines include a comment that starts with a '|' character. Apparently these are not interpreted as comments by Solr. Here's a patch that could fix this.\n\n\n--- /tmp/solr-4.4.0/example/solr/collection1/conf/lang/stopwords_fr.txt\t2013-07-10 11:11:37.000000000 -0400\n+++ stopwords_fr.txt\t2013-08-14 20:33:36.168914026 -0400\n@@ -1,82 +1,78 @@\n- | From svn.tartarus.org/snowball/trunk/website/algorithms/french/stop.txt\n- | This file is distributed under the BSD License.\n- | See http://snowball.tartarus.org/license.php\n- | Also see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html\n- |  - Encoding was converted to UTF-8.\n- |  - This notice was added.\n+# From svn.tartarus.org/snowball/trunk/website/algorithms/french/stop.txt\n+# This file is distributed under the BSD License.\n+# See http://snowball.tartarus.org/license.php\n+# Also see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html\n+#   - Encoding was converted to UTF-8.\n+#   - This notice was added.\n+\n+au\n+aux\n+avec\n+ce\n+ces\n+dans\n+de\n+des\n+du\n+elle\n+en\n+et\n+eux\n+il\n+je\n+la\n+le\n+leur\n+lui\n+ma\n+mais\n+me\n+m\u00eame\n+mes\n+moi\n+mon\n+ne\n+nos\n+notre\n+nous\n+on\n+ou\n+par\n+pas\n+pour\n+qu\n+que\n+qui\n+sa\n+se\n+ses\n+son\n+sur\n+ta\n+te\n+tes\n+toi\n+ton\n+tu\n+un\n+une\n+vos\n+votre\n+vous\n+\n+# Single letter forms\n+c\n+d\n+j\n+l\n+\u00e0\n+m\n+n\n+s\n+t\n+y\n \n- | A French stop word list.
