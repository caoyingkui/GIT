    "description": "When nightly and weekly tests are enabled (Solr has no tests tagged @Monster), a lot of tests fail.  Most of the failures seem to be OOME on PermGen.\n\nI don't know if the PermGen problems can be fixed with changes to the tests, or somehow automatically providing a -XX:MaxPermSize parameter when non-default tests are enabled.  I believe Java 8 eliminates PermGen entirely, so eventually trunk won't have to worry about that, but that doesn't help branch_5x.\n\nAs part of the 5.0 release effort, we need to clean these up.  If ant parameters or environment variables are required so that non-default tests will pass, that should be documented somewhere, probably the HowToContribute page on the wiki.",
