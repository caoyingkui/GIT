    "description": "The solr streaming expression is fast enough to handle multiple queries but most of the use cases are not just select queries. Rather they are combined with either clustering query or facet query. It would be nice to have the streaming expression support clustering and facet query so that we can make use of the worker nodes for such queries. There wont be any aggregation here just including the clusters and facets in the response",
