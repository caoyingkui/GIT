Essentially if you use the QueryResponseWriter it runs out of open files - if you write the output directly, it is fine.\n\nIt does not seem to make any difference what is in the response.\n\nAnyone have any idea what could be going on?\n\n\n\t- - -\n\n\n\nto make post.sh work with the update handler stuff, you will need to add the content type to <commit/>\n\ncurl $URL --data-binary '<commit/>' -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8' "

            "content": "The problem is the use of the response writers for something they weren't originally indended for.\n\nRequests are pretty much always associated with an index searcher.  The searcher is grabbed on-demand and used for the remainder of the request's lifetime.  This is important (lucene docids can change, etc).  At the end of the lifetime of a request, close() must be called to decrement the reference count and close the searcher if necessary.  An open searcher holds the files of the index open (so it's view of the index never changes).\n\nProblem #1: it doesn't look like doFilter() closes the request object.\nProblem #2: update handlers should not request a searcher in the first place... the response writers need to be modified to call getSearcher() on-demand.
