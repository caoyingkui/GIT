    "description": "When trying to index a field of the type solr.SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType the indexing will fail if two vertexes are more than 180 longitudal degress apart.\n\nFor instance this polygon will fail: \n\nPOLYGON((-161 49,  0 49,   20 49,   20 89.1,  0 89.1,   -161 89.2,    -161 49))\n\nbut this will not.\n\nPOLYGON((-160 49,  0 49,   20 49,   20 89.1,  0 89.1,   -160 89.2,    -160 49))\n\nThis contradicts the documentation found here: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrAdaptersForLuceneSpatial4\n\nThe documentation states that each vertex must be less than 180 longitudal degrees apart from the previous vertex.\n\nRelevant parts from the schema.xml file:\n\n    <!-- Field type for storing WTK based polygons -->\n    <fieldType name=\"location_rpt\"   class=\"solr.SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType\"\n               spatialContextFactory=\"com.spatial4j.core.context.jts.JtsSpatialContextFactory\"\n               distErrPct=\"0.025\"\n               maxDistErr=\"0.000009\"\n               units=\"degrees\"\n            />    \n\n<field name=\"geographic_extent\" type=\"location_rpt\" index=\"true\" stored=\"true\" />",

            "content": "From the wiki:\n\nWKT shapes must have each vertex less than 180 degrees in longitude difference than the vertex before it, or else it will be confused as going the wrong way around the globe. The only exception to this is a Polygon representing a rectangle.\n\nSo... the wiki does in fact claim the vertices need to be < 180 degrees apart.  But I can see that you may have been confused from later statements about rectangles in WKT.  FYI in Spatial4j's next release, even rectangles will be bound by the <180 rule and you then needn't bother ensuring that the vertex order is counter-clockwise \u2013 it won't matter. "

            "content": "David Smiley The problem I am having is that even if each point is less than < 180 for the previous one, then the indexing fails as long as two points are more than 180 degrees apart. I.e. it is not possible to make a polygon that spans more than half the globe. Is that what is meant in the documentation? "

I reported it there: https://github.com/spatial4j/spatial4j/issues/41\nOnce this gets fixed (which won't take long as it appears to be a simple bug) then you'll need to build a development non-official release of Spatial4j and deploy that into Solr, replacing Spatial4j 0.3.  I'll close this issue once Spatial4j's next release ends up shipping with Lucene/Solr.\n\nThanks for reporting the bug, Oystein! "
