            "content": "Did you try\n\nant -Drun.clover=true clean-dest clover test-core test generate-clover-reports\n\n\n\nI'm guessing that the clover-report task determines the \"current\" report as all data since the last invocation of clover-setup on the database, disregarding the coverage info from the previous run. Thus when just the contrib tests are run, the core+solrj coverage info from the previous run doesn't show up.\n\nThis could be fixed by either abusing the historical report feature to include all data, or use separate databases for core+solrj and each contrib and merge them with clover-merge before generating the report.
