Looking at your patch, which was pretty simple, it doesn't appear that it'd be hard to support random access should an application which to want this.\n\nA realistic example in my mind is a spatial filter in which a potentially large binary geometry representations of a shape is encoded for each document into DiskDV.  Some fast leading filters narrow down the applicable documents but some documents shape geometry need to be consulted in the DiskDV afterwards.  Does that make sense? ",

In particular, if you had enough memory to store your ordinals mapping in memory, this means that the file-system cache will likely be able to cache the whole ordinals mapping as well (you may just need to decrease a little the amount of memory given the the JVM) so random access should remain fast?
