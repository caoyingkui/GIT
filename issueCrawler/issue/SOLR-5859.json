    "description": "SOLR-5476 depends on Overseer restart.The current strategy is to remove the zk node for leader election and wait for STATUS_UPDATE_DELAY +100 ms and  start the new overseer.\nThough overseer ops are short running,  it is not a 100% foolproof strategy because if an operation takes longer than the wait period there can be race condition.",

This approach is great.\n\nPatch looks good, but some nits with the current version listed below:\n\nOCP\n\nWe info log closing OCP - we probably should not abbreviate it though, a user won't know what it is.\n\n} else if( QUIT.equals(operation)){\n\n\n  }\n  String getId(){\n    return myId;\n  }\n\n\n\nThere are also some project formatting violations - eg spacing, missing new line:     \n\n\n    log.info(\"IsClosed  :{} , {}\", isClosed, this);\n    log.warn(\"OverseerCollectionProcessor.processMessage : \"+ operation + \" , \"+ message.toString());\n\n\n\nI think both of those are wrong - should be one log line under debug.\n\nimport org.apache.zookeeper.data.Stat;\n\nUnused import added.
