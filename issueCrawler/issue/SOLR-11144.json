            "content": "I've finally finished a rather thorough round of review & edits for these docs. I changed a lot of stuff, so I created a branch jira/solr-11144 and have pushed that so you can pull the branch if you want - it's up to date with master as of a few minutes ago.\n\nI didn't keep a list of the stuff I changed as I went, so this list is from memory - if you notice anything I changed to be incorrect, please let me know.\n\n\n\tI changed all of the usages of \u27f9 to \\=>. The character you used rendered very small in both HTML and PDF. I could have left it as => and asciidoctor would have converted it to a nice icon that's larger than what you had used, but this doesn't work in the PDF at all, so precommit doesn't allow it.\n\tA lot of your examples in the reference pages were in the form of \"example input\" => \"example output\", but the input/output sections should be separately monospaced to avoid confusion about which is input and which is output. I changed these so it would look like \"example input => example output\" instead.\n\tI normalized a lot of uses of bold text, particularly in examples, and changed a lot of capitalization of words to lower case.\n\tIn analytics-reduction-functions.adoc, all of the examples were marked as Labeled Lists (with the double colons at the end of the line), but unlike the other pages of reference, there are no examples that follow. Since there was no entry for the list, this broke the PDF. I removed all of these so they are just plain examples on a single line for each reduction function.\n\tIn analytics.adoc:\n\t\n\t\tI changed the presentation of many of the sections of parameters - we generally do these as Labeled Lists, but you used nested unordered lists (i.e., bullet points) which were quite confusing. I think I grokked the relationships between all the parameters, but you should double-check those because I had a hard time wrapping my head around it completely. As a related note, parameters should also always be in monospace instead of bold - I think I caught all of these, but may have missed one or two.\n\t\tI added some comments that we should address, particularly in the faceting & grouping section. I could see this aspect of the component being used a lot, and the parameters seem under-described to me.\n\t\tThe section on Setup didn't cover adding the path to the .jar to the <lib> directive in solrconfig.xml, so I added that. The Overview section was also removed and replaced with it's sub-sections as main sections.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nOne thing I did not fix but needs to be fixed is a mismatch in some pages between the page title and the page shortname - in order for PDF linking to work properly, every page-shortname must match the title and must match the filename (without the .adoc file extension), due to the way the PDF is built as one massive file. If they don't match, the bookmark reference in the PDF won't point to anything and users will jump halfway through a section (if the link happens to work at all, sometimes it won't). This wasn't something you would have known when you wrote this, but we need to fix it before we commit it. We can either change the page-shortname & filenames on these pages or change the page titles - which do you prefer? These are the pages with the mismatch:\n\n\n\tanalytics-reduction-functions.adoc\n\tanalytics-mapping-functions.adoc\n\tanalytics-expression-sources.adoc\n\n\n\nI think that's the bulk of what I changed but may have forgotten some major things since I've been looking at this off & on for a few weeks between other tasks - if you have any questions, please let me know.

I'll take those out of your latest patch for you. If you want to add \"Reference\" back into the titles, let me know and I'll add those back in - we don't need to match titles to filenames anymore at all.\n\nThe other changes look pretty straightforward, I'll do one more review for typos and commit.
