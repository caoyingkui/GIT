    "description": "This issue presents the idea of a special-purpose Lucene index format that is suitable for cross-version compatibility and resilient to changes in Lucene implementations. Please see the attached document for more details.\n\nThe code needs branch lucene-2621 to compile and run. It's still incomplete, in a roughly the same way as the Codec api is still incomplete  However, a separate tool PortableIndexExporter was implemented to illustrate how serialization of all index parts could look like.\n\nComments and suggestions are welcome!",

Stuffing a verbose format into a zip file should handle the data transmission problem. A suitable C library should do basic searches in not very much space.\n\nLucene currently has no \"mobile strategy\". This would be a good toolkit.\n ",
