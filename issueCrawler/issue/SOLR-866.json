We can use this issue to provide an API for handlers/components to use replication handler to sync arbitary indices/files from master to slaves. This feature can also be used in the future for replicating jars to add other handlers/components.",

Or should perhaps plugins (like a suggester) wishing to replicate their own data have some API to add folders/files through ReplicationHandler and get a callback when a replication is done, so they can do whatever necessary to read the new index?
