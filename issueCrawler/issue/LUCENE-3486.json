    "description": "The idea is similar to SOLR-2809 (adding searcher leases to Solr).\n\nThis utility class sits above whatever your source is for \"the\ncurrent\" searcher (eg NRTManager, SearcherManager, etc.), and records\n(holds a reference to) each searcher in recent history.\n\nThe idea is to ensure that when a user does a follow-on action (clicks\nnext page, drills down/up), or when two or more searcher invocations\nwithin a single user search need to happen against the same searcher\n(eg in distributed search), you can retrieve the same searcher you\nused \"last time\".\n\nI think with the new searchAfter API (LUCENE-2215), doing follow-on\nsearches on the same searcher is more important, since the \"bottom\"\n(score/docID) held for that API can easily shift when a new searcher\nis opened.\n\nWhen you do a \"new\" search, you record the searcher you used with the\nmanager, and it returns to you a long token (currently just the\nIR.getVersion()), which you can later use to retrieve the same\nsearcher.\n\nSeparately you must periodically call prune(), to prune the old\nsearchers, ideally from the same thread / at the same time that\nyou open a new searcher.",

And the javadocs are very good too.\n\n\n\tPerhaps instead of \"recordTimeSec = System.nanoTime()/1000000000.0;\" you can use TimeUnit.NANOS.toSeconds? Just for clarity, and get rid of this monstrous number .\n\n\n\n\n\tTypo: \"such that if the use performs\": 'use' --> 'user'\n\n\n\n\n\tAbout this code:\n\n+    if (tracker == null) {\n+      tracker = new SearcherTracker(searcher);\n+      if (searchers.putIfAbsent(version, tracker) != null) {\n+        // Another thread beat us -- must decRef to undo\n+        // incRef done by SearcherTracker ctor:\n+        searcher.getIndexReader().decRef();\n+      }\n\n\nWould it be better if SearcherTracker has a close() method and we call it instead of decRef()-ing on our own? Seems cleaner to me, and I always like to see the code that incRef/new closer to decRef/close. And if tomorrow SearcherTracker needs to clear other things too, we're already covered.\n\n\n\n\n\tAbout this \"// nocommit \u2013 maybe make it 'public' that you just decRef?\" --> do you mean whether we should jdoc that that's all we're doing? If so, why commit to just that? I don't think it contributes to the user ...\n\n\n\n\n\tI have a problem with the Pruner interface. It has a single method prune which takes an IndexSearcher and ageSec (BTW, why is it double and not long?). And there's PruneByAge impl. But, what other impls could there be for this interface, if not by age?\n\t\n\t\tOn the other hand, I can certainly see someone, perhaps w/ NRT, not wanting to keep too many searchers around, and instead of committing to an age, he'll want to use a hard number (like, the newest 5 searchers) - that interface makes it impossible to impl.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nIf you think however that pruning by age, is the only scenario that makes sense, then I suggest removing the interface and having just the impl. Otherwise, perhaps a different interface should be created, one that receives a list of searchers, with their age, and returns a list of searchers that should be released? Just an idea.\n\nHmm, now that I read prune(Pruner) jdoc, I can see how someone could impl \"newest 5 searchers\" by just counting up to 5 in its doPrune() calls, because prune(Pruner) guarantees that the searchers are passed newest to oldest. But still I wonder if the interface is not too limited.\n\nLooks very good ! ",

Not sure this is really needed in practice as large\nmerges don't complete often and it's unlikely you'd hit more than one in\nyour time window...\n\nThanks Shai! ",
