I don't plan on making a comparable Windows version of this myself, but patches welcome on that front. "

We'll get official -help style usage output in the script as well (feel free to open a new JIRA if you're feeling it).\n\nAre there any plans for something - anything - that issues a delete command?\n\nWhat do you have in mind?  One could still do that with the SimplePostTool, with \n\njava -Ddata=args -Dc=tehfiles -classpath dist/solr-core-*.jar org.apache.solr.util.SimplePostTool dist/solr-core-*.jar '<delete><id>42</id></delete>'\n\n however bin/post does not (currently) support -Ddata=args.   Certainly we wouldn't want a user to type in that XML incantation though, so I imagine there could be a bin/delete script that allowed for clean deleting by id or by query.  I'm curious what scenarios and interface folks imagine for a friendlier delete facility. "
