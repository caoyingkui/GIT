    "description": "I would like to have a custom ShardHandlerFactory, which has my own special load balancing logic (among other things).  The HttpShardHandler is what currently handles the parallelization of shard requests.  I would like to reuse it, but it expects package private variables in HttpShardHandlerFactory which it can reach back into for making load balancer requests and a completion service.",

            "content": "Looks good. One thing that sticks out at me while reviewing (not anything introduced by your patch), is that this factory \nuses a Random initialized from the default ctor (e.g. current time or whatever) to shuffle the shards.\n\nIt seems like this would make it hard for unit tests to have deterministic behavior. I think we should add a new parameter\nthat allows you to set the random seed (if not specified, System.currentTimeMillis() or whatever). Solr test framework could\nuse this parameter so that you have the same behavior when you run the test with the same -Dtests.seed. "
