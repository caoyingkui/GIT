After install Solr is completely open, then after you upload security.json to ZK with some default pw, you use this to configure everything. Then, if you like you can pull the resulting security.json file from ZK and ship it with your deploy script?\n\nI still don't think we should encourage hand-editing of users in security.json. ",
