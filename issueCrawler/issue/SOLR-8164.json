    "description": "Since Lucene's removal of boosts on every query, Solr's debug output has been somewhat broken.\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/query?debugQuery=true&q=(foo_s:a^3)^4\nshows    \"parsedquery\":\"BoostQuery(foo_s:a^3.0)\",\nand\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/query?debugQuery=true&q=foo_s:a^=2\nshows    \"parsedquery\":\"ConstantScore(foo_s:a)\",\n\n\n\nSince boosts are now explicit (i.e. BoostQuery), we should probably just move to always showing boosts instead of having logic that tries to be smart about it.",
