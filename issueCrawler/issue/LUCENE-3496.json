I executed all queries on 30M index and the performance with grouping by IDV is somewhere between 500 ms and 550 ms. The same test with grouping by indexed values have search times somewhere between 300 ms and 330 ms.\n\nWe might need to round up the packedint sizes inside IDV for lookup perf and pay the prize for a slightly larger size on disk / memory.\nI think we need this. Just like we have with FC#getTermsIndex(). A boolean option that either uses PackedInt or DirectInt. I think the ~200 ms difference is b/c IDV is using PackedInt and FC uses DirectInt. ",

However, LUCENE-3507 is adressing this issue.\n\none thing I noticed about the patch is that you consider 0 ords as null values which is not the case in IDV. All documents do have values, there is nothing like missing values. VAR_BYTES will return a 0-length byte and FIXED_BYTES will return a fixed-length 0-byte array. Numeric variants default to 0 and 0.0 receptively. ",
