    "description": "I realize that FuzzyQuery.floatToEdits is deprecated, but I'd like to make a small fix for posterity.  Because of floating point issues, if a percentage leads to a number that is very close to a whole number of edits, our cast to int can improperly cause misses.\n\nddddd~0.8  will not match \"ddddX\"\neeeee~0.8 will not match \"eeee\" or \"eeeeee\"\n\nThis is a trivial part of the plan to reduce code duplication with LUCENE-5205.",
