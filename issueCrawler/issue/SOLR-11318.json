They were all pretty easy to write.\n\nIn the course of my testing, I found a bug in AssertTool:\n\n\n[~/c/l/solr] $ bin/solr assert --exitcode --not-started http://www.google.com\n[~/c/l/solr] $ echo $?\n1\n\n\n\nThe exit code of AssertTool is intended to be the number of assertions failed (or 100) on error.  The invocation above should exit with an exit code of 0.\n\nUnless anyone objects, I'll bundle a fix for this in with this patch. ",
