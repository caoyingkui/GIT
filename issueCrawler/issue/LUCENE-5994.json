    "description": "This always causes me confusion every time I look at sorting.  What exactly is \"natural\" order? I can think about it to figure it out (1, 2, 3... is natural), but since the parameter/variable is called \"reversed\" it always requires looking back at the docs (which then state that the flag is reversing the natural order).\n\nI think it would be much clearer to use the ascending/descending terminology. Although I think ascending is better, so that the default would be true, it probably is better to keep the semantics of the boolean the same, thus naming it descending.",
