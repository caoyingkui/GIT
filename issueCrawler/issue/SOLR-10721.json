    "description": "Custom transient core implementations could benefit from knowing two things:\n1> that core discovery is over\n2> that all cores that are going to be loaded have been loaded, i.e. all loadOnStartup cores are done.\n\nIt should be trivial to add a method to CoreContainer like \"isLoaded\" that would answer the first question since you can't get past the load() method without all the cores being discovered. I think this is a more generally useful bit of information than just core discovery is done.\n\nAs for the second, that too seems trivial, just add a method to CoreContainer that returns the number of entries in SolrCores.currentlyLoadingCores.\n\nI'll add this in a few days unless there are objections.",

            "content": "Thinking about this a little more, I can envision other kinds of states being added in the future. Rather than calls for various possibilities, what about starting out with just a long and some bit constants? That would give a more nuanced view and wouldn't require that the users know about stuff like \"loading is finished, therefore core discovery is finished\". \n\nThe fact that setting two bits, call them LOAD_COMPLETED and DISCOVERY_FINISHED at the end of the load() method is an implementation detail.\n ",
