    "description": "So I found this issue when trying out distributed search with solr 3.5 and noticed big performance degradation for some queries comparing to the single box search.\n\nAfter some query analysis and comparison, it turns out that shard queries with \"fsv=true\" are much slower than the same queries w/o \"fsv=true\". Some examples are like 1200ms vs 200ms (start=0, rows=30, hits<100).\n\nFrom the discussions with Yonik Seeley on solr mailing list, it may due to fact that I'm using lot of relevancy queries in sorting. But Solr is not retrieving those sort values efficiently .\n\nThis is critical for us and prevents us from moving to distributed search. I believe users like our scenarios will also suffer from this issue. Any patch/idea is welcomed.   \n\nQuote from Yonik Seeley on solr-user mailing list:\n\"OK, so basically it's slow because functions with embedded relevancy\nqueries are \"forward only\" - if you request the value for a docid\nprevious to the last, we need to reboot the query (re-weight, ask for\nthe scorer, etc).  This means that for your 30 documents, that will\nrequire rebooting the query about 15 times (assuming that roughly half\nof the time the next docid will be less than the previous one).\n\nUnfortunately there's not much you can do externally... we need to\nimplement optimizations at the Solr level for this.\"",
