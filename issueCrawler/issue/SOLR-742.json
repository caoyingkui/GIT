    "description": "Discussion at: http://www.nabble.com/Creating-dynamic-fields-with-DataImportHandler-to19226532.html\n\nDynamic fields aren't created when specified in a DataImportHandler's transformer. \n\nReproducing the issue:\nI have defined a dynamic field (of type sdouble) in my schema called \"_dynamic*\". Inside the transformer's transformRow method, I am adding the name-value pair \"_dynamicTest\" and '1.0'. No errors are observed, but the data does not appear in the index after importing is complete.\n\nInterestingly, I can specify that same name-value pair combination in the DataImportHandler's config file, and it does appear in the index.",

This patch solves the core problem partially by allowing Transformers to add a dynamic field/value pair to the document. Ideally, we'd like to support variables in the 'name' attribute as well.\n\nOnce 1.3 is release, we should look at adding complete support for dynamic fields. "
