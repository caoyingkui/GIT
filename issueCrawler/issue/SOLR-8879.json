    "description": "When the group cache limit is exceeded (see the warning \"The grouping cache is active, but not used because it exceeded the max cache limit of %d percent\" at the Grouping class), and some of the results are filtered by a post filter, the number of matches at the response is wrong (doesn't take the post filter into account). \n\nSeems like this can be fixed if the following lines are added after the warning and before searchWithTimeLimiter:\n          if (pf.postFilter != null) \n{\n            pf.postFilter.setLastDelegate(secondPhaseCollectors);\n            secondPhaseCollectors = pf.postFilter;\n          }\n\n(because exceeding the cache limit should work exactly as working with no cache at all)",
