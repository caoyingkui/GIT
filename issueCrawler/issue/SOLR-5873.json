    "description": "SOLR-5265 added backward compatibility tests, but it tries to read a pre-written binary file to check if there is a break a not. If we add more types to JavaBinCodec the test will need to be updated too, which will be error prone again.\n\nThis is what [~hakeber] proposed on IRC - \n\n\n\tA test that I was thinking of: we could have a jenkins job that ran a script that checked out the previous version of lucene and the the latest\n\tThen use the solr/cloud-dev scripts to start a cloud cluster\n\tIndex some docs\n\tStop a node at a time, replace webapp with the latest in a rolling upgrade fashion\n\tThen we have a full rolling upgrade test\n\n\n\nThis would be a better approach for back compat tests.",
