    "description": "As we did in SOLR-3915 for a Legend on the Cloud Screen, perhaps another one might be helpful on the Analysis Screen. We're currently using an abbreviation which follows the Rule \"All uppercase characters from the classname\", which ends up with something like this:\n\nLCF : org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.LowerCaseFilter\nENGTF : org.apache.lucene.analysis.ngram.EdgeNGramTokenFilter\n\nActually those abbreviations already show the complete classname (including the package) on mouseover, but an additional legend might help especially new users who might not identify LCF on the first look ..",
