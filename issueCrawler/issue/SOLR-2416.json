Perhaps we should make \"recursive parsing\" a config option, so people can choose?\n\nAlso, according to http://wiki.apache.org/tika/RecursiveMetadata the parser passed to the context is the parser used to parse inner files. Your patch assumes that is always AutoDetectParser, but in the case someone passes stream.type=application/zip, you'll be lost. So perhaps a better way is to create a new AutodetectParser to pass to the context.\n\nWould you like to attempt a new patch with this fix as well as controlling it via a config parameter, e.g. recurseContainers=true?\n\nPlease also add a JUnit test case to the patch to verify the fix.

Also in earlier versions of Solr it worked different than now: grepping code of org.apache.solr.handler.extraction.ExtractingDocumentLoader from version 1.4.0.1 show that context was not created and instead autoDetectParser::parse function was called with 3 parameters (without context) and this caused context to be automatically created with Parser=autoDetectParser...\nthis is backward compatibility violation after adding PasswordProvider. Also comments in current code suggest that someone was not sure about consequences of such change: \"TODO: should we design a way to pass in parse context?\"\n\nthe patch is already attached as I see...
