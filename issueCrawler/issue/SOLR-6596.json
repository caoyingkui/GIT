One can change some field of parent document without affecting the parent child relationship! If you change the document main fields probably it is true both for other fields i dont think so. For example think that you are going to index web pages in Solr. Suppose you consider web page comments as a child of the corresponding page. In this situation some secondary parts of page might change during time but comments are still valid. In this condition the main parts of page such as title, description and contents are same but some secondary parts might change that do not affect the validity of comments! ",
