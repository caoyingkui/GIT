In some cases like when deletes are not `final` in the way that documents that are marked as deleted should not be merged away a `soft-delete` is needed which is possible when doc-values updates can be done atomically just like delete and add in updateDocument(s)\n\nThis change introduces such a soft update that reuses all code paths from deletes to update all previously updated documents for a given term instead of marking it as deleted.

Maybe the CHANGES.txt entry should make reference to the particular method so user's can easily get to further explanatory javadocs.\n\nI suggest the javadocs more explicitly give the user an idea of what this might be used for, since it seems a bit abstract as-is.  For example:\nOne use of this API is to retain older versions of documents instead of replacing them. The existing documents can be updated to reflect they are no longer current while atomically adding new documents at the same time.\n\nThe patch did not apply for me git apply ../patches/LUCENE-8200.patch ... probably because your GH repository does not have the same git lineage as the official ASF repo that is mirrored/forked elsewhere.

I don't really understand why you bring this up like a second time here. it's unrelated.\n1st time was just an unrelated question; sorry if asking it annoyed you.\n2nd time is perhaps in retrospect misattributed.  I thought that your repo shared no lineage with ASF's but now I think I'm mistaken.  If it didn't share lineage (which was my thinking at the time I commented), it would explain why \"git apply ...\" didn't work.  But it's not that.  It didn't work when I tried to apply it in IntelliJ either.  A mystery; ah well.  Does \"git apply ...\" work for anyone else here for this patch?  My usual method is to apply patches directly in IntelliJ but when that failed I went to the CLI and found it failed there too, so I'm stumped.  Raw patches are harder to review as thoroughly as one can in an IDE (of course). ",
