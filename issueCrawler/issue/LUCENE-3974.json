    "description": "LUCENE-3969 is the first use case that really motivated me to open this:\n\nHere we are building random Analysis chains from all the Tokenizers, TokenFilters, \nCharFilters, etc that we can possibly find, and kicking them around to find bugs.\n\nBut we only do this in the analyzers-common module. Really I want to combine\nall the analysis components across common, phonetic, kuromoji, uima, icu, etc to \ncreate more interesting chains and increase test coverage.\n\nSo I think along with having a modular architecture, we have some responsibility\nto test different modules combined together, as sometimes we find bugs like\nLUCENE-3920 that no unit test will ever discover.\n\nCan/Should we create some sort of test module that depends on every lucene module and\nis a free-for-all for crazy integration tests?",
