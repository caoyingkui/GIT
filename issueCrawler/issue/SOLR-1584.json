    "description": "The current implementation of setIncludeScore(boolean) adds the value \"score\" to the FL parameter.\nThis causes a problem when using the setFields followed by include score.\nIf I do this:\n\nsetFields(\"*\");\nsetIncludeScore(true);\n\nI would expect the outcome to be \"fl=*,score\"\nInstead the outcome is: \"fl=* &fl=score\" which fails to use the score field as FL is not a multi-valued field.\n\nThe current implementation in the SolrJ SolrQuery object is:\nadd(\"fl\", \"score\")\ninstead it should be:\nset(\"fl\", get(\"fl\") + \",score\")\n\nobviously not as simplistic as that, but you catch my drift...",
