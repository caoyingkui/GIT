    "description": "Currently the only way to change the date format used by QueryParser.java is to override the getRangeQuery method. This seems a bit excessive to me. Since QueryParser isn't threadsafe (like DateFormat) I would suggest that a DateFormat field be introduced (protected DateFormat dateFormat) and a setter be introduced (public void setDateFormat(DateFormat format)) so that it's easier to customize the date format in queries. If there are good reasons against this (can't imagine, but who knows) why not introduce a protected 'DateFormat:createDateFormat())' method so that, again, it's easier for clients to override this logic.",
