    "description": "Here is a re-write of the solr ruby client library. This is a simplified set of features, but really only missing the mapper/indexer code that's present in the current solr-ruby. Bringing those in will be the next step.\n\nTests are in test. Please read the README, there are instructions for running the tests.\n\nA Solr 1.3 distribution is including for tests.\n\n\n\tfind patch in file uploads \"rewrite.1.patch\"\n\n\n\n\n\tMatt Mitchell",
