It seems to me that this method could be supported but we'd create the input stream on the fly via extending InputSource and doing the work in the getter.  We don't want to create the stream if nobody calls it (even if we know that our particular consumer happens to call it and close it).  Apparently the caller of the getInputStream is supposed to close it so perhaps this means we don't even need to close it in the Config constructor since the doc builder parse() method will. "

I think that's perfectly fine to preserve the SystemID along with the InputStream.\n\nProblem is that the XML handling is a little bit inconsistent, because it currently only work for files and only if the files are in exact same directory. Theoretically, it should be possible that a XML file that is in the conf folder (which is part of the classpath) can load a file from the lib folder (which is also part of the resource classpath and should work with a relative filename only path) or even from inside a JAR file (if the java package name == classpath directory is identical).\n\nThis could only be solved by e.g. supplying a method RessourceLoader.asFooBarResolver that returns a class that implements both org.xml.sax.EntityResolver, javax.xml.transform.URIResolver (to work with either SAX and TRAX) and delegates all requests to the underlying classloader. Example could be taken from http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipentres.html (warning: this example is not correct, but goes into right direction).\n\nAnother solution might be to not pass streams around, but simply feed the xml parser with the URL.toString() returned by ClassLoader.getResource(). This would also work with JAR files (I use this quite often in my code to parse XSL or other XML files in the JAR file of my programs):\n\n\nfinal URL url=MyClass.class.getResource(\"myXSLTFile.xslt\");\nif (url == null) throw new FileNotFoundException();\nfinal Templates templates = transformerFactory.newTemplates(new StreamSource(t.toString()));\n\n\n\nThis would also successfully load relative resources, but not accross JAR files or different dirs (so \"./anyfile.xml\" would only find the file if its in same java package in same JAR files but not if the file is in a different JAR file or other classpath entry in same package).

            "content": "Here is a first mockup (branch_3.x like the previous patch) of the version with EntityResolver.\n\nThis patch has some backwards breaks, because for XML files it is always broken to parse without a system identifier, so the ctors of SolrSchema and SolrConfig should not take InputStream but more a InputSource wrapper. With this patch everything compiles and tests and resolves correctly, but plugins using old methods may fail (needs review).\n\nHow it works:\nThe system identifier is no longer a plain filename with path, it gets initialized using a custom URI scheme \"solrres:\". This scheme is resolved using the EntityResolver that utilizes SolrResourceLoader. As long as somebody only gives relative URLs in XIncludes or anywhere else (this is also extendable to other places, not only xinclude, e.g. external XML entities inside XSLs, config of DIH,...), the files are staying using this scheme and are resolved by the custom EntityResolver. As soon as scheme changes, the default resolver is used.\n\nBecause of this, the good thing is, that somebody can still use absolute filesystem URLs or even external URLs in the xincludes, by using full schemed URIs like file:///my/absolute/path.\n\nOther places in Solr that load XML and support Xinclude must also changed to this, currently almost every place where solr loads XML files from ResourceLoader using InputStreams are broken.\n\nQuestionable is also backwards compatibibility. Ideally there should be a loadResourceAsInputSource() method in ResourceLoader so DIH can also use it, which would also break backwards (interface!).\n\nThis patch is currently only for review about the idea. Comments welcome! "

But the Config base class is also used e.g. for parsing some requests where the XML comes from network as InputStream only. Supporting xinclude here is broken, as this network stream has no systemId, so I would simply disable xinclude and the EntityResolver if Config class only gets an InputStream instead of InputSource. Also it should not be possible to load arbitrary files from the filesystem referenced by a xml file in a network stream (this is somehow a security leak).\nAfter making the whole thing separate for InputSource and InputStreanm, it could also easily be made backwards compatible, as the InputStream methods are separate and support no xinclude and are not.
