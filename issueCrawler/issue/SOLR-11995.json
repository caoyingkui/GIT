    "description": "Sometimes it is possible to fix a violation by exchanging replicas between two nodes. But the current suggestion API cannot do that in cases where each individual move operation increases violations. We should introduce a two-step swap operation during policy computations (no SWAP API is planned) which allows us to achieve this goal even if intermediate operations violate policy rules.",
