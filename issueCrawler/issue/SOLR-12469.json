However, after reading a bit more about the terminology confusion, see this article:\u00a0https://certsimple.com/blog/ssl-or-tls, I think I've changed my mind about the priority. Since \"everyone\" are still saying SSL we could keep SSL as the main term, but add TLS in addition for findability. So perhaps the page title should be \"Enabling SSL/TLS\" and also mention TLS elsewhere on the page? ",
