This is particularly important while testing, because the alternate core very likely has a slightly different configuration or schema.",

            "content": "The challenge here is first identifying what the correct behaviour should be. I would expect that when you select a new core, you are abandoning the existing one. However, as you suggest, sometimes you build up a complex query for example, then realise you did it against the wrong core. A way to switch would be nice, but a clear signposting for this option isn't immediately obvious to me. ",
