    "description": "The Solr exporter for Prometheus/Grafana provides a useful visual layer over the solr metrics api for monitoring the state of a Solr cluster. Currently this can not be configured and used on a secure Solr cluster with the Basic Authentication plugin enabled. The exporter does not provide a mechanism\u00a0to configure/pass through basic auth credentials when SolrJ requests information from the metrics api endpoints and would be a useful addition for Solr users running a secure Solr instance.",

I just skimmed the patch, and a few piece of advice to start with\n\n\tPlease read https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute#Creating_the_patch_file\u00a0\n\tIn particular, name the file\u00a0SOLR-12584.patch and avoid unrelated whitespace changes\n\tI also see some unnecessary comments, some new lines that are\u00a0commented out etc. Please clean up, the patch should then be much smaller\n\n\n\nAlso, see my comment from August where I propose that\nIt should probably support the same env vars and password file as bin/solr script does, so that users could configure the Exporter in the same way they do with Solr itself.\"\nWhat I mean by that is that\u00a0we should re-use the same way of configuring the exporter as we already to for configuring Solr itself and e.g. the bin/solr script, which is by setting two env.variables. See copy-paste from solr.in.sh:\n\n# Settings for authentication\n# Please configure only one of SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_BUILDER or SOLR_AUTH_TYPE parameters\n#SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_BUILDER=\"org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.PreemptiveBasicAuthClientBuilderFactory\"\n#SOLR_AUTH_TYPE=\"basic\"\n#SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_OPTS=\"-Dbasicauth=solr:SolrRocks\"\n\n\nThis will also allow for type 'kerberos' and future auth types that may be invented later.\n\n\u00a0 ",
