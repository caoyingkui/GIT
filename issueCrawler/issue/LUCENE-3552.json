    "description": "The facet module contains two interfaces TaxonomyWriter and TaxonomyReader, with two implementations Lucene*. We've never actually implemented two TaxonomyWriters/Readers, so I'm not sure if these interfaces are useful anymore. Therefore I'd like to propose that we do either of the following:\n\n\n\tRemove the interfaces and remove the Lucene part from the implementation classes (to end up with TW/TR impls). Or,\n\tKeep the interfaces, but rename the Lucene* impls to Directory*.\n\n\n\nWhatever we do, I'd like to make the impls/interfaces impl also TwoPhaseCommit.\n\nAny preferences?",

Currently, indeed, and we are left with Lucene (Directory) implementation only. But I thought that as the interface is already there, and we have some thoughts of yet another implementation of taxonomy index (and hence TaxonomyReader/Writer), as part of the Lucene search index, which may help to ease the burden of synch between these two indices, why not let the interface live a bit longer before we remove it.
