In certain use cases, it's helpful to see the error message so that clients can take appropriate actions.\n\nIn 4.7, here's what gets shown if there is an error during indexing:\n\nSimplePostTool: WARNING: Solr returned an error #400 Bad Request\nSimplePostTool: WARNING: IOException while reading response: java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 400 for URL: http://localhost:8983/solr/update\n\nIt would be helpful to print out the \"msg\" that is returned from Solr.",

When no explicit charset parameter is provided by the sender, media subtypes of the \"text\" type are defined to have a default charset value of \"ISO-8859-1\" when received via HTTP. Data in character sets other than \"ISO-8859-1\" or its subsets MUST be labeled with an appropriate charset value. See section 3.4.1 for compatibility problems. "
