    "description": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to include solr 4.4 in a larger webapplication.\nComments in web.xml say that I can configure a path-prefix for solr stuff.\nTo do this I read that I have to (i.e. under /search prefix) :\n1. configure init-param of SolrRequestFilter with /search\n2. change url-pattern of SolrRequestFilter with /search/*\n3. move all admin interface in a subfolder search, so something like app.war/search/<admin_stuff>\n\nDoing this admin interface doesn't work, because admin.html contains some placeholder (${version},${contextPath},${adminPath}) that are replaced by LoadAdminUiServlet\nReading source code I see that LoadAdminUiServlet this replacements is inside a if block\n\n InputStream in = getServletContext().getResourceAsStream(\"/admin.html\");\n    if(in != null && cores != null) {\n\nbut in variable is null because admin.html has been moved in search subfolder.\n\nHave I misunderstood something ?\nthanks\nMirko",
