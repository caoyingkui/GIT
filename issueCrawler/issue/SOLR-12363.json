    "description": "We do have a\u00a0SolrCloud cluster and just updated one of our views to use cursors with\u00a0the random order. Our goal was to use an infinite scroll with the random ordering so we can shuffle\u00a0results once every 24 hours.\n\nTo do so we save the seed that we use in our random order to the cookies with the 24 hours\u00a0expiration period, which didn't work as expected:\n\n\tResults are shuffled with every request (every time we pass the initial cursor value \"*\" and the same random value for ordering we already used).\n\tResults contain duplicates sometimes. Not a lot of them, but from time to time they appear.\n\n\n\nIn our schema.xml\u00a0we have:\n\n<fieldType name=\"rand\" class=\"solr.RandomSortField\" omitNorms=\"true\"/>\n<dynamicField name=\"random_*\" stored=\"false\" type=\"rand\" multiValued=\"false\" indexed=\"true\"/>\n\nIn our search requests, we order by\u00a0random_123 asc, id asc, where\u00a0123 is the seed from cookies.\n\nHere is the page https://awards.wegohealth.com/nominees\n\nEven when I try to get the \"next page\" URL from google chrome developer console and open it in separate tabs it yields different results: https://awards.wegohealth.com/nominees?cursor=AoJYmYbyATRBd2FyZDo6Tm9taW5lZSAxMzI0Mg%3D%3D\n\nSo it feels like the seed parameter we use is ignored or every shard\u00a0understands it differently, not sure.\n\nOn the screenshots, you can see the URL is the same and results are different.",
