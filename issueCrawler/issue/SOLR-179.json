    "description": "When something goes wrong in solr configuration, I want solr to stop working and loudly say \"something went wrong\"  This patch adds a collection of severe errors to SolrConfig.  If abortOnConfigurationError=true and there are errors, the SolrDispatchFilter prints out a nice message saying \"hey something went wrong!\"\n\nThe specific things that were hidden in error files that will now give dramatic error are:\n\n\tunknown class for RequestHandler/ResponseWriter\n\tany exception throw during handler/writer init()\n\n\n\nIf you want to disable this behavior (perhaps for a production environment) you need to add:\n  <abortOnConfigurationError>false</abortOnConfigurationError>\nto solrconfig.xml\n\n\nfor more discussion, see:\nhttp://www.nabble.com/merely-a-suggestion%3A-schema.xml-validator-or-better-schema-validation-logging-tf3331929.html",
