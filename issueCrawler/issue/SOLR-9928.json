The reason for this design is that I wanted consistency of adding the metrics monitoring no matter what implementation users provided, and I couldn't count on metrics being injected in every implementation (adding this functionality to base DirectoryFactory wouldn't do it, because users would be free to create non-instrumented Directory impls anyway).\n\nSo yes, it looks like we need to be consistent and unwrap this one level in every call that takes Directory as argument.
