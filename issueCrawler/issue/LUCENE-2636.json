I personally think ChainingCollector is fine as well (and describes better what this class is about), however for consistency I think I'll rename it to MultiCollector. Any objections? ",

If you eventually run w/ a single Collector, no need to have MultiCollector in the middle. I'll change MC then to have a private ctor and a static create method. I would like though for the method to receive a Collector... rather than List, because I think it simplifies matters on the application's end. And create will filter out all the null ones ...\n\nI'll post a patch soon. ",
