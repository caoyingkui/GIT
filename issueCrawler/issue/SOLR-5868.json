This is meant to protect clients that are making external requests out across the internet, but requests within the the SOLR cluster should be trusted and can be relaxed to simplify the SSL/certificate setup process.",

            "content": "No, it can be configurable if we desire, but it will need to come from a system property since there isn't a global way to set HttpClientUtil params up-front at startup. This was more of an observation that while using solr in a distributed fashion it would be a nightmare to keep up with changes to your certificate when dealing with host names. HttpClient's default value is completely reasonable for making external requests to other systems but I believe in this case the reasonable default is to simplify the maintenance nightmare that ensues with having the stricter policy, especially since all of the requests are being made within the client's own clustered environment.
