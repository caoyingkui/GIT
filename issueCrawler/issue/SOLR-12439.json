I considered clients that have been out of beta for a long time.\n\nHow singular the API design and focus is is also something I considered, there is no reason to argue about it here.\n\nThe decision on the client did not come down to those individual points, nor was it a 1 on 1 comparison. Regardless, with Apache HttpClient 5 in beta, I only looked at it out of curiosity more than anything. ",
