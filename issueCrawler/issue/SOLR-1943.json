    "description": "With LUCENE-2484, Lucene's trunk API changed incompatible. As the clustering contrib depends on a older carror2 jar file compoiled against an older version of Lucene (3.0), the tests failed to run (TermAttribute class removed).\n\nAs we should be able to change the APIs in trunk without forcing external projects like carrot2 to update its internal stuff to work with Lucene trunk.\n\nThe attached patch will simply rename \"build.xml\" to \"build.xml.disabled\", so the module is simply no loger built. After we create a release branch out of trunk, wen can simply enable it again after upgrading the carror2.jar files.",
