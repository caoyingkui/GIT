    "description": "This issue was initially spun off of SOLR-10425 based on some failing tests related to the behavior of PointFields w/ useDocValuesAsStored=false  that seemed unrelated to the root of that issue.  SOLR-10425 was committed with a disabled test refering to this jira which can be enabled to see the problem.\n\nFurther diagnoses made it clear that this behavior is actaully fundemental by design for al field types \u2013 see comments below \u2013 and that only the test needed fixed to reflect reality.",
