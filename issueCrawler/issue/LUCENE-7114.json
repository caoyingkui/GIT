I already did this on the core-dev list, but the people there are different and they don't have the problems. Non-Hotspot fixes get it into the EA builds quite fast.\n\nThe problem are Hotspot fixes. As noted in my article about FOSDEM (which was titled \"How free is OpenJDK\" in German version: see https://jaxenter.com/java-9-steals-spotlight-open-jdk-project-takes-back-123721.html), the problems in Hotspot are more complicated. Also other non-Oracle developers, e.g. from SAP, were complaining about the processes inside Hotspot and how patches get accepted. There is also a separate test suite that is not public! Before this one not passes, it does not get into EA builds and so on. To me it looks like there is a lot of additional bureaucratic \"quality\" control behind the scenes that delay inclusion into the EA builds. It looks like the stuff is merged several times to other branches (check out JIRA about that). The frightening fact is: these \"quality\" checks don't ensure quality, as we all see. So it would be better to remove that bureaucracy and let the community test as soon as the patch is committed to repository. We should mention that over an over on conferences, discussions, and the mailing lists. "
