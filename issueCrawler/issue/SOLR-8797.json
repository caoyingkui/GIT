In\nthis case, the command is doing a backup on an index that is not\ncomplete and return a http code 200. We end up with a partial index\nbackup ! As a workaround we will do this backup against the leader of\nthe cloud: the leader is never in recovery mode.\n\n    In our opinion, the backup command on a recovering index should\nreturn a http code 503 Service Unavailable (and not http code 200 OK).\n\n  Mail in the mail list",

            "content": "Hi Gerald,\n\nYes this will happen now. Currently Solr supports backup and restore of cores . When SOLR-5750 is complete this problem will be solved since Solr will support backup/restore of a cloud collection. There backups will only be taken against the leaders.\n\nCurrently as a workaround you can use the CLUSTERSTATUS Collection API to fetch the leaders of replicas and issue a backup against those specific nodes ",
