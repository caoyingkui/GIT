Analyzer.java \u2013 Made the tokenStream(String, Reader) into an abstract method.\n\n2. Some items that were marked as deprecated actually needed a reduction in visibility from public to private, and the getter/setters referenced instead\n\n3. All tests pass.\n\n4. Removed test-deprecated.\n\n5. The file deprecation-notes.txt are most likely included in the patch, but they can be deleted, as this comment is more recent.\n\n6.  I did not review the documentation (i.e. javadocs, demo/tutorial, etc.) to look for references to deprecated items\n\nLet me know if there is anything else that is needed.\n\n-Grant ",

But that won't break anyone who compiles in 1.9.1 without deprecation warnings, which is the more important promise.\n\nThen we'll have a proto-2.0 release for developers to test.  We can separately decide how to handle dates in the QueryParser.  It would not be wrong to continue doing the same thing we've done in 1.9, would it?  That won't break anyone.\n\nIn short, let's not let this issue stop us from removing all of the other deprecated code and finding out whether anything else breaks. ",
