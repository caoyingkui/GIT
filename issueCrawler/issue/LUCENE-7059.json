    "description": "The new PointInSetQuery (LUCENE-7048) hit a tricky test failure\n(https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-Tests-trunk-Java8/871/)\nwhere point values were sometimes not visited in order like it\nexpected.\n\nI pushed a hack to fix the query, but I think we should do a better\nfix, here, making the \"values in order in the 1D case\" part of the\nAPI, fixing CheckIndex, AssertingPointFormat to verify this, and\nremoving the buggy MultiPointValues.\n\nI also found a possibly serious bug in BKDWriter, where it was doing\nwriteInt/writeLong to its offline files, but then reading with\nreadVInt/readVLong!  It's hard to provoke, though: it only strikes\nin the tie-break case (same values across docs), and even then only if\nthe IntroSorter does a non-stable sort.  I made a failing test\ncase and fixed that bug, and also removed the unnecessary ord tie\nbreaking from BKDWriter's comparator.\n\nFinally, I saw BKDWriter was failing to pass on its\nmaxMBSortInHeap down to OfflineSorter, and fixed that.",
