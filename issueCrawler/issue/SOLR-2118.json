            "content": "Setting the divisor that way shouldn't likely work on trunk anymore, since Lucene dropped it. That is just a generic 'call this bean method' system.\n\nI think the story is that the interval came first, but we don't specify indexwriter anywhere in solrconfig, so it made sense to go where it is perhaps - and then later this generic system to call setters was impl'd, and it just happens that for a little while you could use it to set the termIndexInterval.\n\nI'm all for consistency if it possible though. So far, Solr has really avoided exposing an IndexWriter - it's not even part of the UpdateHandler interface. We have hacked around that here and there by exposing in DirectUpdateHandler2 and counting on that impl for certain functionality. "

That is just a generic 'call this bean method' system.\n\nI am not referring to the IW parameter, but the IR param. The IR param is named termIndex Interval but is really the terms index divisor, this is what I feel is misleading and confusing.\n\njust look at Solr's IndexReaderFactory to see:\n\n\nInteger v = (Integer)args.get(\"setTermIndexInterval\");\n    if (v != null) {\n      termInfosIndexDivisor = v.intValue();\n    }\n\n "
