    "description": "During the Solr Unleashed training at Revolution, it was discovered that Windows based machines could not use the solr.cmd file to start/stop/restart/etc. Solr instances. On the last day of class one of the participants indicated that by opening the solr.cmd file with Wordpad (Notepad) did not work) and saving it without making any changes that the cmd file then worked just fine. Within one minute of that announcement, at least three other participants indicated that the stated procedure made the cmd file usable for them also. \n\nTim Potter check the file tonight and reported that the svn:eol-style is \"native\" and should instead be \"CRLF\"",
