    "description": "This may be a non-Solr issue, but I am not fully sure. I see tons of test failures on Fedora 26 and 27, but everything is fine on Fedora 25. This is the case even when the same kernel version was used for both 25 and 26 (passed on 25, failed on 26). Reasons of failure seem to be ZK connection loss. Using docker container for Fedora 25 seems to work.\n\nFiling a JIRA just so that someone can investigate and also so that someone avoids using Solr on production on these distributions, until a fix is found.\n\nBTW, Gus Heck reported that he saw similar issues with Ubuntu 17.04:\nhttp://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/6-6-2-Release-tp4358534p4358682.html\n\nHere's some discussion:\nIshan's initial post (I mistook this to be a kernel issue at first):\nhttp://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/6-6-2-Release-tp4358534p4358603.html \nUwe's post: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/6-6-2-Release-tp4358534p4358712.html",
