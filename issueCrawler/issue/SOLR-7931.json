    "description": "I have encountered the problem where restarting of a cluster  that was previously started will result in the servers not being able to startup fully. \nI had to purge the directory of the nodes (node1 and node2) in order to start all over again.\nThis is similar to the problem reported in SOLR-7394 . \n\nStart Command: solr start -e cloud -noprompt\nRestart command: solr restart -e cloud -noprompt\n\nSometimes attempting to restart will result in 1 of the servers up . But most of the time, the server remain down.",

It works . But getting both servers to come up may need a few tries of stopping and starting before both servers can come back online. ",
