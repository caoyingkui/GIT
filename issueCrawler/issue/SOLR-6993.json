    "description": "There's a bug that will prevent install_solr_service.sh from working on RHEL / CentOS 6.5.  It works on Ubuntu 14.  Appears to be some obscure difference in bash expression evaluation behavior.\n\nline 87 and 89:    SOLR_DIR=${SOLR_INSTALL_FILE:0:-4}\n\nblows up with this error:\n\n./install_solr_service.sh: line 87: -4: substring expression < 0\n\nthis results in the archive not being extracted and rest of the script won't work.\n\nI tested a simple change:\n  SOLR_DIR=${SOLR_INSTALL_FILE%.tgz}\nand verified it works on both RHEL 6.5 and Ubuntu 14\n\nPatch is attached.  I set this to Major thinking that not being able to install on CentOS is worth fixing prior to release.",
