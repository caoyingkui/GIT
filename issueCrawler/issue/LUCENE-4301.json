    "description": "Having a test timeout is great (for things like test hangs), but its going to cause a lot of failed builds until we factor in the various flags that can cause tests to run longer, or enable longer-running tests.\n\nIts hard to say what the limits should be since jenkins history is pretty limited at the moment (only 2 nightly runs history available)",

It could be a system property override but then you'd have to set it properly based on your jenkins configuration, etc.\n\nI'll re-enable for max. suite time = 2 hours? Alternatively override @TimeoutSuite on a particular test class that you know lasts longer than that. ",

Maybe we can do something similar here (wrapping this huge synthetic reader with SlowMultiReaderWrapper)? ",
