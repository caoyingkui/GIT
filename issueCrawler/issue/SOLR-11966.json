    "description": "bin/solr stop -all shuts down Solr processes in some random order but if it stops the Solr with embedded ZooKeeper first then the rest of the processes take a lot of time to stop. The cause is that those processes wait to delete their live node from ZK which has to time out first before the shutdown proceeds.\n\nWe should stop the Solr running the embedded ZK at the very end.",
