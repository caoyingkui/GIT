    "description": "This optimization for the JSON Facet API came up a few months ago on the mailing list (I think by Toke).\nBasically, if one expects many hits per bucket, use a temporary array to accumulate segment ords and map them all at the end to global ords.  This saves redundant segOrd->globalOrd mappings at the cost of having to scan the temp array.",
