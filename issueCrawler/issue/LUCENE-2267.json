            "content": "Patch with a heavy improved version of solrs macros, I changed:\n\n\n\tFor security reasons, the password is not passed through command line (you can see it with \"ps -ef\" !!!). Also \"--passphrase\" does not work with newer 2.x versions of gpg. The correct way is the same as in Mike McCandless Python script to pass \"--passphrase-fd 0\" (then it read the passphrase from stdin), piping in the password using the \"inputstring\" task attribute of ant.\n\tadded \"--batch\" parameter to gpg. Without, in GUI environments it ignores the passed-in password and uses gpg-agent\n\tno manual signing of every file, it uses the <apply> ant task that starts a process for every file in a fileset and also supplies a source -> desfilename mapping (which appends \".asc\")\n\tadd \"--default-key\" with a default value of \"CODE SIGNING KEY\", you can override with \"-Dgpg.key=YourHexKeyOrEmail\"\n\n\n\nThe only problem is that <appy> does not print the command lines or some filelist. You only get a message at the end that \"applied 'gpg' to x files\", which is fine.\n\nUsage:\n\nant sign-artifacts -Dgpg.exe=/path/to/gpg -Dgpg.key=YourHexKeyOrEmail -Dgpg.passphrase=12345\n\n\nAll parameters are optional, defaults are:\n\ngpg.exe = \"gpg\"\ngpg.key = \"CODE SIGNING KEY\"\ngpg.passphrase = <none>, if not given, you are asked to input\n\n ",
