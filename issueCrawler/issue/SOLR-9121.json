The point of SOLR-9109 is to allow the user to supply a custom ivysettings.xml, and ideally they shouldn't have to know that the build uses a nesting strategy to set Ivy variables for dependencies' versions.\n\nAt a minimum, if we end up going with your patch, the name of the passed-in nested ivy settings file shouldn't include the word \"default\", since when the user supplies a custom one, it won't be that.
