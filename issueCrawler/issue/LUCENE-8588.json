    "description": "While reviewing code in FrozenBufferedUpdates I noticed that it uses the deprecated RAMOutputStream. This issue fixes it. Separately we should reduce the usage of that class, so that we can really remove it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBesides that, while running tests I hit a test failure which at first I thought was related to this change, but then noticed that the test doesn't close the DirectoryReader (I run tests on Windows), so that fix is included in this patch too.",
