    "description": "(Please note that the feature described in LUCENE-2425 is required reading for this issue.) \n\nThe archiving split policy extends the rotating split policy by archiving sub-indices over-flowing from the split index. This allows for older documents that are \"past their prime\" to be available outside the context of the split index, even if they are no longer visible therein. \n\nIt does so by overriding the RotatingSplitPolicy#maybeExpungeOldestSplit method. In particular, it archives (i.e., makes a copy of) the last sub-index (about to be expunged), just before the rotating policy actually expunges it.\n\nJust like the rotating split policy constrains the number of sub-indices, the archiving split policy too puts a limit on the number of sub-archives (i.e. sub-indices that have been archived and expunged) that the split index will maintain at any given point in time.",
