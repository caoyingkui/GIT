The main reason for ThreadLocal.withInitial() is to use it like that:\n\n\nprivate static final ThreadLocal<Integer> CALL_DEPTH = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);\n\n\n\nUsing a Supplier without a lambda is not the intention behind this method /API \nIn Java 7, you can use the code like this fix comitted. If you want it verbose in Java 8, I would also use the Java 7 code...\n\nUwe ",
