    "description": "If some URPs are defined in the configuration and have names, then there should be support to define a update chain using those named URPs.\n\nProposed syntax:\n\n<updateRequestProcessorChain name=\"mychain\" \n       processor=\"p1,p2\">\n\n\n\nThe motivation for doing this is so that Config APIs could then be used to modify individual named URPs which are part of a chain. Note: config API doesn't have any support for editing the URPs inside update chains right now; hence this is a step forward.",
