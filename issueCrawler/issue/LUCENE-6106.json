    "description": "Currently FilterCachingPolicy.onCache is supposed to be called every time that FilterCache.onCache is used. However, this does not necessarily reflect how much a filter is used. For instance you can call cache and not use the filter, or call cache once and then use it a hundred times. It would be more useful to know how many times a filter has been used on a top level reader, and I think we can do this by doing something like below in the caching wrapper filter?\n\n\n@Override\n    public DocIdSet getDocIdSet(LeafReaderContext context, Bits acceptDocs) throws IOException {\n      if (context.ord == 0) {\n        // increment counter\n      }\n    }",
