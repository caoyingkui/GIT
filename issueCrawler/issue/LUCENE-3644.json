    "description": "There are two major problems:\n1. The listener api does not really apply all indexreaders. for example segmentreaders dont fire it on close, only segmentcorereaders. this is wrong, a segmentcorereader is not an indexreader. Furthermore, if you register it on a top-level reader you get events for anything under the reader tree (sometimes, unless they are segmentreaders as mentioned above, where it doesnt work correctly at all).\n2. Furthermore your listener is 'passed along' in a viral fashion from clone() and reopen(). This means for example, if you are trying to listen to readers in NRT search you are just accumulating reader listeners, all potentially keeping references to old indexreaders (because, in order to deal with #1 your listener must 'keep' a reference to the IR it was registered on, so it can check if thats really the one).\n\nWe should discuss how to fix #1. \n\nI will create a patch for #2 shortly and commit it, its just plain wrong.",

This should be done by base class and be protected final, then normal IndexReaders dont need to f*ck with it. Just make the listeners collection in IndexReader base class final and initialize with MapBackedSet(CHM).\nDirectoryReader and other MultiReaders may simply delegate the registration to the subreaders, but dont pass sets around. If they need to copy all, just do \"for (Listener l: this.listenerss) subreader[i].add(l);\", sharing the same map between different readers is wrong. ",

If you are implementing a cache based on core readers (think custom filter cache for example), its basically the only sane way to do it (and not have to handle weak references which is bad on GC and error prone with complex keys). And Lucene should allow for that.\n\nI don't think the separation to segment core listener and index reader listener is the best solution here, since it exposes \"too much info\" to the user (having to deal with different reader cases, check FieldCacheImpl for example). I don't really mind it, since in my case I only work on low level Segment case (which is the sane way to work when you do NRT) and can handle it, but not sure its best in a general usability wise case. What the user want is: here is a reader, which I cache base on it, and here is a listener, call me back when that listener is no longer valid. ",
