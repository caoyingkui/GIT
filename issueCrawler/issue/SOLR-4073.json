    "description": "One overseer disconnect with Zookeeper, but overseer thread still handle the request(A) in the DistributedQueue. Example: overseer thread reconnect Zookeeper try to remove the Top's request. \"workQueue.remove();\".   \n\nNow the other server will take over the overseer privilege because old overseer disconnect. Start overseer thread and handle the queue request(A) again, and remove the request(A) from queue, then try to get the top's request(B, doesn't get). In the this time old overseer reconnect with ZooKeeper, and remove the top's request from queue. Now the top request is B, it is moved by old overseer server.  New overseer server never do B request,because this request deleted by old overseer server, at the last this request(B) miss operations.\n\nAt best, distributeQueue.peek can get the request's ID that will be removed for workqueue.remove(ID), not remove the top's request.",
