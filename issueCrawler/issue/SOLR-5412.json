    "description": "This is a  request handler wrapper around components in ConcordanceSearcher submitted in LUCENE-5205.  It quantifies the variation in term matches of a fuzzy search, and optionally returns group counts for other categorical fields or class values in a document.\n\nIt does do some distributed tf*idf calculations for fewer than 25 shards.\n\n**Following Yonik's Law** \nThis is patch is more of a placeholder for a much more polished draft.  Among other things, test scripts and javadocs are forthcoming!\n\nA Lucene-based implementation is also forthcoming, see Tim Allison's code.",
