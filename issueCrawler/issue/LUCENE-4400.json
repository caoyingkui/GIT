    "description": "From Thomas on LUCENE-3720:\n\nbtw. the next release will happen quite soon afaik and will also include a new phonetic encoder called Nysiis, which should perform slightly better than Soundex (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CODEC-63). Any feedback is very welcome!\n\nI didn't do this in LUCENE-3720 because I wanted to fix the bug separately, but this should be pretty easy to add.",
