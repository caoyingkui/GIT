    "description": "Hi,\nin a production environment made of 1 leader and 1 replica, it's the second time in 20 days that the replica goes out of sync. With \"out of sync\" I mean that the leader has 60439 documents and the replica has only 2 documents!\nIn the solr's logs I didn't find any error; it seems that the system is ok.\nHave you ever experienced a problem like that one?\nHow can I resync the two nodes without reindexing all?\n\nIf needed, I can send logs and the index of the replica.\n\nThanks for your support.",
