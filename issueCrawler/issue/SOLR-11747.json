    "description": "Currently, the cool down period is a fixed period during which events generated from triggers aren't accepted. The cool down starts after actions performed by a previous event finish. But it doesn't protect against triggers acting on intermediate cluster state during the time the actions are executing. Events can still be created and persisted to ZK and will be executed serially once the cool down finishes.\n\nTo protect against, this I intend to modify the behaviour of the system to pause all triggers from execution between the start of actions and end of cool down period. The triggers will be resumed after the cool down period expires.",

In practice, almost no IGNORED events are received by listeners so this\u00a0necessitated\u00a0a few changes in various tests. ",
