It could be overriden from command-line as:\n\n-Dtests.suiteTimeout=5000!\n\n\n\nthis means 5000 millis, forced over all suites.\n\nNote that hung JVMs that do not timeout are typically JVMs that are not responsive or frozen for some other reason. This has happened in the past (the timeouting is implemented on the forked JVM side, to allow IDEs, etc. to benefit from it as they don't fork a separate JVM. ",
