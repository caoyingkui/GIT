For example, here is schema.xml I had:\n\n\n    <fieldType name=\"text_engram_front\" class=\"solr.TextField\">\n      <avalyzer type=\"index\">\n        <tokenizer class=\"solr.StandardTokenizerFactory\"/>\n        <filter class=\"solr.ICUTransformFilterFactory\" id=\"Any-Latin;Latin-ASCII;Lower()\"/>\n        <filter class=\"solr.EdgeNGramFilterFactory\" minGramSize=\"1\" maxGramSize=\"20\"/>\n      </avalyzer>\n      <analyzer type=\"query\">\n<!-- skipped -->\n      </analyzer>\n    </fieldType>\n\n\n\nNote that index analyzer tag name is written as avalyzer (it's v instead of n). Solr would save me several hours if it logged a warning that schema.xml contains unknown tags.",

            "content": "Actually, the Tokenizer/TokenFilter/CharFilters already throw an exception, if they get invalid properties as attributes. This only works with \"new\" factories, older ones maybe from plugins cannot handle this. All the provided ones from the distribution of Lucene can do this.\n\nBut we do not check the general structure of the XML document. I don't think a schema would help (as Hoss pointed out), but we can maybe handle that in the schema parser that it throws execption on unknown elements / attributes (like the analysis factories do).
