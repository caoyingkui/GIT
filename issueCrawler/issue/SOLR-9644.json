            "content": "GitHub user EreMaijala opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/98\n\n    SOLR-9644: Fix boost handling in SimpleMLTQParser and CloudMLTQParser.\n\n    Both parsers tried to handle field boosts but didn't do it properly. This pull request includes the following changes to both:\n\n\n\tParse boosts from qf even if boost=false to avoid errors.\n\tUse the field names from the boost parsing so that they are always clean.\n\tAdd tests for the same query with and without boosting.\n\n\n\n    Also fixed is an additional problem in CloudMLTQParser where it added IndexableField type fields to the filtered document as is, which caused the document to include field definition strings such as \"stored\" and \"indexed\". This caused the MLT query to return records including these terms under some circumstances.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/EreMaijala/lucene-solr master\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/98.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #98\n\n\ncommit 70ad5ccbb4a5b39b16f41c58dd5ee058811b6d9c\nAuthor: Ere Maijala <ere.maijala@helsinki.fi>\nDate:   2016-10-17T07:02:40Z\n\n    SOLR-9644 Fixed SimpleMLTQParser and CloudMLTQParser to handle boosts properly and CloudMLTQParser to only extract actual values from IndexableField type fields to the filtered document.\n\ncommit e10b9385df5c3183e80ed084fa48b0c4da9dd476\nAuthor: Ere Maijala <ere.maijala@helsinki.fi>\nDate:   2016-10-17T07:30:36Z\n\n    Improved the SimpleMLTQParserTest test case so that it actually shows a difference in results when boosting is used.\n\n ",
