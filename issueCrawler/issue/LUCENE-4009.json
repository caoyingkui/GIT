    "description": "LUCENE-1049 introduced a enhanced implementation of the toString() method in the BooleanFilter clause.\nThis was an improvement, however I'm still seeing a lot Lucene filter classes not overriding the toString method resulting in a toString returning the classname and the hashcode of the object. \nThis can be useful sometimes, but it's totally not useful in my case.\nI want to see the properties set in the filters so I know which Lucene query was created.\n\nNow:\nBooleanFilter(+BooleanFilter(BooleanFilter(+org.apache.lucene.search.TermsFilter@ea81ba60 +org.apache.lucene.search.TermsFilter@26ea3cbc) BooleanFilter(+org.apache.lucene.search.TermsFilter@df621f09 +org.apache.lucene.search.TermsFilter@2f712446)))\n\nWanted behavior:\nBooleanFilter(+BooleanFilter(BooleanFilter(+inStock:Y +barCode:12345678) BooleanFilter(+isHeavy:N +isDamaged:Y)))",
