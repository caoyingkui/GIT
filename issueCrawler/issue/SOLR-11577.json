    "description": "Found this problem when doing SOLR-11576. The case here is \n1. collection1 has 2 shards and 1 replicas each (on node1 and node2)\n2. restart node2\n3. do indexing then commit using CloudSolrClient\n4. assert that docs are found\n\nStep 3 is always success, cause CloudSolrClient will do retry requesting on stale clusterstate (SOLR-11484). But HttpShardHandler does not. So there is a chance that we will meet an assertion error on step 4 because HttpShardHandler will throw a SolrException if it can not found an alive replica for a shard ( no servers hosting shard: ... )",
