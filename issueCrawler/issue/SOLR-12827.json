    "description": "SOLR-12387 introduced cluster wide defaults for collection properties. However, the syntax committed is flat and ugly e.g. collectionDefaults instead of defaults/collection inspite of the latter being proposed by Andrzej. Anyway, we should change the format now before it sees widespread use. I propose to fix documentation to describe the new format and auto-convert cluster properties to new syntax on startup.",

It can also be written using the APIs. However, it is auto-converted to the new format on reads and writes. We can get rid of the conversion logic in Solr 9.\n\nThe patch also updates the reference guide to mention only the new format. I added a note saying that the old API syntax continues to be supported but it will be auto-converted.\n\nI'll commit once tests and precommit pass. ",

Using the API\nstructure for Solr 7.4 or Solr 7.5 with \"collectionDefaults\" will continue to work but the format of the properties \nwill automatically be converted to the new nested structure. Support for the \"collectionDefaults\" key will be \nremoved in Solr 9.\n\n ",
