    "description": "QueryWrapperFilter has not been needed ever since Filter was changed to extend Query \u2013 LUCENE-1518.  It was retained because there was at least one place in Lucene that had a Filter/Query distinction, but it was forgotten when Filter moved to Solr.  It contains some code that creates a temporary IndexSearcher but forgets to null out the cache on it, and so QueryWrapperFilter can add non-trivial overhead.  We should simply remove it altogether.",

Some tests will need to be removed/adjusted if it is eliminated.\n\nTests pass.\nCould you please take a look Yonik Seeley ",

The only remaining use of the class was in AbstractAnalyticsFieldTest (analytics contrib, tests) which was a very unnecessary use of Filters to simply know which docs were live (not deleted).\nI don't see a need to leave QWF in 7x; Filters are Queries.\nI plan to commit tomorrow.
