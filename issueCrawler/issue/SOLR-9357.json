    "description": "I'm a little out of my comfort zone, so posting this for discussion. If, for any reason, ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient doesn't get a response from a replica (say a network glitch or the like), it seems to initiate a LIR on the replica. This is around line 243 in 5.3.2, and the corresponding code in 6x looks unchanged on a quick perusal.\n\nThis is fragile in the sense that a simple retry could avoid the replica going into recovery if the problem is transient.\n\nI don't think this is issuing a retry higher in the stack, but we're seeing this behavior in the field so I'm posting this here for discussion, I've had a back-channel discussion already so a JIRA seems in order.\n\nThe other thing I'm not entirely sure of is whether retrying at this point in the process is something that will avoid versioning problems, although I believe the docs already have a version stamp so it should be OK.",
