    "description": "Digging on LUCENE-2504, I noticed that TermOrdValComparator's compareBottom method falls back on compare-by-value when it needn't.\n\nSpecifically, if we know the current bottom ord \"matches\" the current segment, we can skip the value comparison when the ords are the same (ie, return 0) because the ords are exactly comparable.\n\nThis is hurting string sort perf especially for optimized indices (and also unoptimized indices), and especially for highly redundant (not many unique values) fields.  This affects all releases >= 2.9.x, but trunk is likely more severely affected since looking up a value is more costly.",

With this fix we no longer compare by value at all if index is a single segment (I think!). ",
