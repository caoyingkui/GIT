The users shouldn't need to be bothered about 'NamedList' but instead should have an easier way to work with the response e.g.: Create an collection should return a response object that has methods like:\n\n\tgetReplicaInfo() - returns replica information about the newly created replicas.\n\n\n\nList collections:\n\n\treturn a List<String> via a call that looks like response.getCollections()\n\n\n\nand so on.",

It needs improvements in :\n\n\tOverseerStatusResponse and ClusterStatusResponse object\n\tCorrect 'isSuccess' method that returns true only if the request was successful, after looking at the HTTP response code, exceptions, etc.\n\tDocumentation - javadocs and ref guide\n\tMigration of tests to use these response objects instead of reinventing the wheel everytime\n\n ",
