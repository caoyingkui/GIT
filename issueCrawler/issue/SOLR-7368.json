    "description": "Now , we have a way to register an updateProcessor and add it to a chain at request time, it makes sense to make our vast library of UpdteRequestProcessorFactories  available at request time . This means , the processors will optionally accept input from request params instead of strictly reading them from config.\n\nfor example , the FirstFieldValueUpdateProcessorFactory can be pre-registered as _firstField and it can be made to honor a param called _firstField.fieldName  . In that case a user can directly use the component by adding two params to the request processor=_firstField&_firstField.fieldName=someFieldName",
