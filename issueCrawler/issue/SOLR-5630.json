    "description": "ExtendedDismaxQParser allows leading wildcard by default but doesn't provide an override. The SolrQueryParser has setter/getter methods, but nothing accesses the getter, so this property is effectively  ignored. There should be a way to set this property via schema.xml, solrconfig.xml, or a plugin code override, and have the property honored.",
