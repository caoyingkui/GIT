While working on random access filters, I removed the cache options completely, but Mike readded them later (I have to lookup the issue number).\nIn my opinion, Robert is right: If you don't have a static index, the chahing of deletes is horrible, as it invalidates the cache on every delete. If you have a static index, you should expungedeletes it, so all acceptDocs will be null and BitsFilteredDocIdSet.wrap() (used by the Cache to apply deletes) with be a no-op. ",
