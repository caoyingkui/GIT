    "description": "There are a raft of Perl scripts in the Lucene/Solr project. Five are used by the build, one is an undocumented release manager's tool, three are code generators that are saved for reference, and 2 appear truly dead. \n\n\nlucene/benchmark/build.xml    refers to    scripts/shingle.bm2jira.pl\nlucene/build.xml    refers to    @{changes.src.dir}/changes2html.pl \n  OR lucene/site/changes/changes2html.pl\nlucene/common-build.xml    refers to    ${dev-tools.scripts.dir}/write.stage.maven.build.xml.pl\n  OR dev-tools/scripts/write.stage.maven.build.xml.pl\nsolr/build.xml    refers to    ${common-solr.dir}/dev-tools/stub-analysis-factory-maker.pl\n  OR solr/dev-tools/stub-analysis-factory-maker.pl\nlucene/benchmark/build.xml    refers to    scripts/collation.bm2jira.pl\n\n\n\nThis is a release manager's tool which is not documented anywhere that LucidFind crawls: http://find.searchhub.org/?q=poll-mirrors.pl.
