    "description": "Currently SecurityConfHandler in Solr does not support configuring top-level elements of the security.json file (e.g. authentication or authorization section). Users are expected to manually upload the security.json file containing initial configuration to Zookeeper. Once this is done, the individual authentication/authorization plugins can edit their own configuration via Solr HTTP APIs.\n\nThis jira is to allow these global properties to be configured via Solr HTTP APIs.",
