    "description": "In the Join module, TermsIncludingScoreQuery's Weight implementation looks suspiciously wrong.  It creates a Weight based on the original query and delegates a couple calls to it in getValueForNormalization() and normalize() \u2013 ok fine.  But then it doesn't do anything with it!  Furthermore, the original query has already been run by this point anyway.\n\nQuestion: Should the original query, which currently runs separately (see JoinUtil), participate in the Weight normalization of the main query?  It would be tricky to wire all this together based on the current structure but arguably that is more correct.",

Any query normalisation should happen on the \"from\" query. The \"to\"  query (TermsIncludingScoreQuery) should just use the scores it gets from the \"from\" query (so query time boosts should be placed on the \"from\" query). ",
