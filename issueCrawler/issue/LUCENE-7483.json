    "description": "QueryParser incorrectly parses the expression t1 AND t2 OR t3 AND t4 as\n(+t1 +t2 +t3 +t4) while t1 AND t2 AND t3 AND t4 produces the same result.\n\nThe expected result for expression t1 AND t2 OR t3 AND t4 is (+t1 +t2) (+t3 +t4).\n\nThis occurs using StandardQueryParser or classic.QueryParser.",
