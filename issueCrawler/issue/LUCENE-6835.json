    "description": "Rob's idea:\n\nToday, we have hairy logic in IndexFileDeleter to deal with Windows file systems that cannot delete still open files.\n\nAnd with LUCENE-6829, where OfflineSorter now must deal with the situation too ... I worked around it by fixing all tests to disable the virus checker.\n\nI think it makes more sense to push this \"platform specific problem\" lower in the stack, into Directory?  I.e., its deleteFile method would catch the access denied, and then retry the deletion later.  Then we could re-enable virus checker on all these tests, simplify IndexFileDeleter, etc.\n\nMaybe in the future we could further push this down, into WindowsDirectory,  and fix FSDirectory.open to return WindowsDirectory on windows ...",

            "content": "Tentative initial patch, but there are problems.\n\nI removed IFD's hairy code about retrying deletes (yay!), and moved it\ndown into FSDirectory, so it now becomes a Directory impl's job to\n\"deal with\" finicky filesystems that prevent deletion of open files.\n\nI also changed Directory.deleteFile to Directory.deleteFiles, so\n\"revisit pending deletions\" is less O(N^2).\n\nThe big problem with the patch now is I completely disabled MDW's\nvirus/open-file checker, because we are no longer allowed to \"fake\" a\nvirus checker in a Directory wrapper (since it's now Directory's job\nto do retries on deletes) ... I think to move forward w/ this approach\nwe must also re-implement the virus checker \"down low\" inside Mock FS\n\nSome tests are still angry because they rely on MDW's not deleting\nstill open files ...

I think\nwe may want to pull out the \"retry deletions\" from FSDirectory\ninto a new WindowsFSDirectory or a wrapper or something ... but I\nthink we should do this separately.  I think this issue is a good step\nforward to migrating OS specifics down lower in the stack, and it's\nnot easy: progress not perfection!\n\nAlso, the VirusCheckingFS only interferes with Files.delete\ntoday, but I imagine a real evil virus checker would do other things\nlike prevent renaming a file.  But then, Lucene already does not\nprotect against that anymore (only retry on delete).\n\nI think the latest branch is ready ... distributed beasting only\nuncovered an unrelated issue (LUCENE-7017).  I'll merge soon. "
