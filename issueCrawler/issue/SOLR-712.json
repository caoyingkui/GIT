    "description": "This patch modifies the Config.java and IndexSchema.java to support XML entity includes of relative paths. When parsing an InputStream not providing a SystemID (i.e. base path for example) to the DOM parser will basically force all entity includes to be relative to the base project directory rather than the directory hosting the document. This patch simply passes in the configuration directory as the systemID thus making the entity includes relative to the home of solrconfig.xml and schema.xml. \n\nThe IndexSchema.java was modified to ensure objects do NOT process the xml:base attribute. Newer Xerces-J parsers allow for the removal of this attribute in the DOM (by setting the appropriate feature); however, the DOM parser used by Java 5 doesn't support this feature.\n\nFor example:\nWithout the entity include, if my Solr app was running on C:\\solr, then any entity includes would have to be relative to C:\\solr regardless of solrconfig.xml and schema.xml. This patch allows for includes relative to the conf directory of solr.home (i.e. ../../my_base_schema.xml) would be located two directories above \"conf\".\n\nPlease submit improvements or comments on this patch.",
