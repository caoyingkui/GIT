    "description": "The magic incantation needed to use EmbeddedSolrServer is pretty bad.  It's a complicated assembly of SolrConfig, CoreDescriptor, SolrCore, and of course EmbeddedSolrServer.  Some arguments are optional, some not, (which you won't know until you try or wade through the spaghetti) path arguments are Strings which are less clear than File but worse it's not clear when relative directories are used, what is relative to where and what defaults where.  Its a mess.  \n\nSorry if I've offended anyone but I don't think it's any one person's fault.  I think it evolved a little here and little there and the resulting complexity may have been overlooked.",
