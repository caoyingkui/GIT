One thing to note is the Github repo is actually a mirror of the real Git repo hosted by the ASF, so no PR in Github will ever be directly merged via Github. For attribution, we make sure to explicitly mention contributors in Solr's (or Lucene's) CHANGES.txt (which I did). If you want to link to the commits I posted earlier when you close the PR that would be fine and lead anyone looking at the PR in the right direction. ",
