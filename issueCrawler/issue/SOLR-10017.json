    "description": "The crawl Streaming Expression will wrap a stream that emits root URL's to crawl. It will then crawl the URL's using a library such as Crawler4j. It will emit tuples that can be indexed into a Solr Cloud collection using the update function. Solr's classifier can be used to curate content as it's being crawled or classify sites based on the content which it contains. The links between pages and sites can be indexed as graphs and then explored and visualized with graph expressions.",
