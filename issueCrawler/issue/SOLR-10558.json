    "description": "The ChildDocTransformer has a limit on a number of child documents returned per parent document. The default is set to 10.\n\nWe have a use case where we need to return all child documents.\n\nThe current workaround is to set the limit to a number so high it's unlikely any parent document ever would have that many child documents. It would be less error prone if the limit could be set to \"unlimited\".",

            "content": "I've attached a small patch showing one way this change could be done.  In it, any negative \"limit\" param is treated as a flag value, and the limit is effectively disabled by using Integer.MAX_VALUE as the limit value.  This is really just an internalization of the current workaround the reporter mentioned above.\n\n(Another way to handle this would have been to create a SolrIndexSearcher method which doesn't take a limit at all, but that seemed like a big change for what we're trying to accomplish here.)\n\nAll tests pass locally ",
