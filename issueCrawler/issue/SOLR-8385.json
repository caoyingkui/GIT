    "description": "Currently, StreamFactory has several overloaded withFunctionName methods.  One of these, takes two parameters: a String functionName, and a Class implementation type.\n\nThis second parameter is a little too generic, because it's really only ever valid for a small, small subset of classes (i.e. Class<? extends Expressible ).  Narrowing the type of this parameter is a small step towards preventing accidental misconfiguration of a StreamFactory.",
