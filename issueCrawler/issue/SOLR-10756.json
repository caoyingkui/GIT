            "content": "I found only two usages of this method in the code base out of which one of them is in a test that is easily replaced with the more specific forceCollectionUpdate() method call. The other is in the main overseer loop and only invoked when there was an error processing a work item. Typically that happens either because of a BadVersionException (someone else updated the cluster state) or due to malformed update that cannot be applied.\n\nNow, the BadVersionException can also tell us exactly what path returned the BadVersionException \u2013 so theoretically we can extract the collection name that was being updated and replace the updatedClusterState call with the more specific forceCollectionUpdate call. However, since our cluster state mutators can throw a variety of exceptions, we cannot be sure if they really need a fresh cluster state or if forcing update of a specific collection is fine.\n\nWe should replace the usage of this method in the test with forceUpdateCollection method anyway since that is simple enough.\n\nAs for the overseer we could go three ways here:\n\n\tAudit all the mutator classes used by overseer and determine what exceptions need refreshed state and if they can be specialized to a single collection. Then, extract the specific collection from BadVersionException and other exceptions identified by the above step and use that to call forceUpdateCollection method instead of this deprecated method\n\tCreate a (private to Overseer) sub-class of ZkStateReader and move the updateClusterState method there. This will need many methods of ZkStateReader that are currently private to be made protected.\n\tLive with it and do the last point that Hoss proposed in the description i.e. rename this method to something more dangerous sounding and mark lucene.internal\n\n\n\nI think there is little upside to getting rid of this method so I'd recommend path 3 above.
