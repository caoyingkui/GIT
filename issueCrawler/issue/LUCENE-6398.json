    "description": "This ticket is to address usability and documentation problems found while trying to do the 5.1 RC. Overall, it's a powerful process, but want to make it a bit easier for newbies doing it the first time.\n\nHere's the start:\n\n1) dev-tools/scripts/buildAndPushRelease.py\n\nPrompts you for the following:\n\nEnter GPG keystore password: \n\n\n\nIt's really asking for the passphrase the key you're using to sign the release artifacts, so it seems like it should prompt for something like:\n\n\nEnter secret passphrase for key:\n\n\n\n2. At the end of a release build, the scripts says:\n\n\nNext set the PYTHON_EXEC env var and you can run the smoker tester:\n  $PYTHON_EXEC dev-tools/scripts/buildAndPushRelease.py URL\n\n\n\nRunning that command verbatim, you get an error:\n\n\nusage: buildAndPushRelease.py [-h] [--no-prepare] [--push-remote USERNAME]\n                              [--push-local PATH] [--sign KEYID]\n                              [--rc-num NUM] [--smoke-test PATH]\n                              checkout_path\nbuildAndPushRelease.py: error: Root path is not a valid lucene-solr checkout\n[~/dev/lw/projects/lucene_solr_5_1]$ $PYTHON_EXEC dev-tools/scripts/buildAndPushRelease.py --smoke-test file:///Users/timpotter/dev/lw/releases/5.1rc1/lucene-solr-5.1.0-RC1-rev1671632\nusage: buildAndPushRelease.py [-h] [--no-prepare] [--push-remote USERNAME]\n                              [--push-local PATH] [--sign KEYID]\n                              [--rc-num NUM] [--smoke-test PATH]\n                              checkout_path\nbuildAndPushRelease.py: error: the following arguments are required: checkout_path\n\n\n\nSo we need to fix the example to display what is actually needed to run.\n\nWill add more to the docs as I go thru the process, but wanted to get a ticket in place for making improvements.",
