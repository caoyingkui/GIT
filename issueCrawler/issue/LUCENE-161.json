However, if I send this to the query parser -\n \"/message[@type]:message\", it doesn't unescape the field name.",

Escaping the escape char should work as well.\n\nNote that I had to uncomment some test cases and provide others as it seemed to \nme that the test cases were testing an incorrect behavior.\n\nHave fun,\n\nJean-Francois Halleux ",
