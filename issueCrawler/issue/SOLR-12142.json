    "description": "In SOLR-11380, SolrRequest.getContentWriter was introduced as a replacement for getContentStreams. \u00a0However, EmbeddedSolrServer still calls getContentStreams, and so clients who need to send POST data to it cannot yet switch from the Deprecated API to the new API. \u00a0The SolrTextTagger is an example of a\u00a0project\u00a0where one would want to do this.\n\nIt seems EmbeddedSolrServer ought to check for getContentWriter and if present then convert it into a ContentStream somehow. \u00a0For the time being, ESS needs to call both since both APIs exist.\n\nCC Noble Paul",
