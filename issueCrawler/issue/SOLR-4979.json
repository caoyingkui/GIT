    "description": "The problem appears in version 4.3.1 and in revision 1498027.  I\nattached a two-line patch (patch.diff) that fixes it.\n\nIn method \"DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler.readDocument\", the loop over\n\"reader.getAttributeLocalName\" keeps overriding \"fieldName\" with\n\"reader.getAttributeValue\".  Therefore, only the last written value\nis visible out of the loop and all the other writes and iterations are\nnot necessary.  The patch iterates from the end of\n\"reader.getAttributeLocalName\" and breaks the first time when\n\"fieldName\" is set.\n\nThe above fix (in patch.diff) is certainly correct (it's easy to see\nthrough code inspection), but I think we can have an even shorter\npatch (one line, in patchShort.diff): just break as soon as\n\"fieldName\" is set, without reversion the loop order.  patchShort.diff\nis correct only if there can be only one \"attrName\" equal to \"name\"\n(which I think it's the case), or if it doesn't matter which attribute\nvalue \"fieldName\" gets, as long as the condition\n\"name\".equals(attrName) is satisfied.",
