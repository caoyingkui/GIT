    "description": "bin/solr's AssertTool provides a simple way to check a number of things about a running Solr.  Directory existence/non-existence, running user, exposed URL, etc.\n\nA natural extension of this is to add options to check whether Solr is running in standalone or cloud mode.\n\nThis JIRA proposes adding -cloud <url> and -not-cloud <url> options to the AssertTool.",
