    "description": "After a recent RHEL O/S upgrade,\u00a0 the admin UI was returning a 404 error even thought the SOLR service was up and running.\u00a0 Further investigation suggested that the root cause was the java version used to start the service was to blame.\u00a0 Since we were seeing the issue only on QA and PROD had not yet been patched, the Linux admin restarted the service on the affected server using the pre-ugrade version of the JDK, which solved the issue.\n\nWe're wondering why this would fail on\u00a0 a minor point version upgrade.\n\nMore details:\n\nPre-upgrade - RHEL 7.4 , openjdk v 1.8.0_144\n\nPost-upgrade - RHEL 7.5, openjdk v 1.8.0_171-8 (the service started, but admin UI not working)\n\nSolr version 6.6.0",
