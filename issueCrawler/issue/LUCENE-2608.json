For Lucene, the change is backward compatible, for Solr, it is not back compatible for those who implement their own SolrSpellChecker, as I introduced a more future proof parameter passing capability.  I also added a means for per implementation parameters to be passed in.  Interpretation of those entries are entirely up to the implementation. ",
