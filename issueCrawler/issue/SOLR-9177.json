    "description": "After reading through the comments on SOLR-8145 and from my own experience, seems like a reasonable number of people run Solr in foreground mode in production.\n\nTo give some more context, I've seen Solr hit OOM, which leads to IW being closed by Lucene. The Solr process hangs in there and without the oom killer, while all queries continue to work, all update requests start failing.\n\nI think it makes sense to add support to the bin/solr script to add the oom hook when running in fg mode.",

I found this issue after seeing this in the IRC channel today:\n\n\n14:37 < wryfi> elyograg: looking at bin/solr, i see that -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError\n               is only set when the process is backgrounded, whereas upstart\n               likes to run things in the foreground. so that explains why the\n               option was missing. i wonder what the reasoning was behind that\n               and/or if this should be a bug report.\n\n ",

Taking action when the process ends is simply a matter of script or code after the call to start the process. ",
