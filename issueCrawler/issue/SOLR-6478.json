    "description": "historically, the rules for \"core\" names have been vague but implicitly defined based on the rule that it had to be a valid directory path name - but i don't know that we've ever documented anywhere what the rules are for a \"collection\" name when dealing with the Collections API.\n\nI haven't had a chance to try this, but i suspect that using the Collections API you can create any collection name you want, and the zk/clusterstate.json data will all be fine, and you'll then be able to request anything you want from that collection as long as you properly URL escape it in your request URLs ... but we should have a test that tries to do this, and document any actual limitations that pop up and/or fix those limitations so we really can have arbitrary collection names.",
