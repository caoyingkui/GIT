    "description": "See the java-dev mailing list discussion: http://www.nabble.com/Broken-javadocs-%3Esite-docs-links-to20369092.html.\n\nWhen the Lucene Java website transitioned to versioning some of the documentation, links from some javadocs were not modified to follow the resources.  I found broken links to gettingstarted.html and queryparsersyntax.html.  Here is one example, to gettingstarted.html (the link text is \"demo\"): \n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/document/package-summary.html\n\nThe attached patch converts absolute URLs from javadocs to versioned docs to be relative, and modifies the \"javadocs-all\" target in build.xml to add a path element named \"all\", so that both versions of the javadocs (all: core+contrib; and separated: core, contribs) can use the same relative URLs.  Adding a path element to the \"javadocs-all\" target is necessary because currently the \"all\" javadocs have one fewer path element than the separated javadocs.\n\nI left as-is one absolute URL, in the o.a.l.index.SegmentInfos javadocs, to fileformats.html, because SegmentInfos is a package-private class, and the javadocs targets in build.xml only generate javadocs for public classes.",

Also, I had forgotten to change the sidebar link to the All javadocs to include the new \"all\" path element, in src/site/src/documentation/content/xdocs/site.xml.\n\nThis version fixes these two issues.
