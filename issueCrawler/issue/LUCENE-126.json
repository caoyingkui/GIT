    "description": "Add a getPrefix method to PrefixQuery and to make getEnum(IndexReader reader) in MultiTermQuery a public method. \n\nThese minor changes allow client code to retrieve matched terms in the index, which consequently makes search term highlighting for prefix and fuzzy queries possible.",
