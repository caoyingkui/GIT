    "description": "Typing only:\n\nbin/solr\n\n\n...prints the generic tool help, but if you add a -h\n\nbin/solr -h\n\n\n...you get an error message and the help for the start command. In fact, any unknown parameter given, such as bin/solr -foo will assume start.\n\nThis is confusing, since -h is a common help option. Could check for the special case where there is only the -h switch given, in which case we should not assume the intention is to do start but to get help.",
