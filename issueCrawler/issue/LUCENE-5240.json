This boolean seems to be used to emulate an empty TokenStream if the input is empty (which NumericTokenStream cannot do).\n\nThe TrieFields no longer need a Tokenizer in Solr, so we should remove this one (it now uses NumericField internally).

            "content": "OK! Thanks for removing TrieTokencorrumpter! Just one question: Is the TrieTokenizer really not needed for highlighting? I know, the TrieField is now \"tokenized=false\", but I have no idea how this affects the highlighter. On the other hand, highlighting a trie field is completely useless \n\nI know, ElasticSearch has cloned TrieTokenizer and it uses it for highlighting... Adrien knows more, he did that porting.\n\nFor 4.x, we have to add TrieTokenizerFactory to the backwards breaks, because somebody might have used it... We should suggest to use a real TrieField in that case! ",
