    "description": "A recent profile of the new BooleanScorer2 showed that \nquite a bit of CPU time is spent in the advanceAfterCurrent method \nof DisjunctionScorer, and in the PriorityQueue of scorers that \nis used there. \n\nThis patch reduces the internal overhead of DisjunctionScorer \nto about 70% of the current one (ie. 30% saving in cpu time). \nIt also reduces the number of calls to the subscorers, but \nthat was not measured. \n\nTo get this, it was necessary to specialize the PriorityQueue \nfor a Scorer and to add move some code fragments from DisjunctionScorer \nto this specialized queue.",
