I'll change that in a constructor where the toSearcher and preComputedFromDocs are optional.\n\nHow does the preComputedFromDocs work? It's not per-segment? Like it's a bitset across entire toplevel doc space?\nYes, it is a bitset across all segments, so toplevel. The whole query implementation is top level. People can use this the execute the real query outside the JoinQuery (if this isn't specified the query is executed when the Weight is created for the JoinQuery). I think this would be nice if people want the for example cache the encapsulated query.\n\nI wonder if we can make this work per-segment... but that can be a 2nd phase.\nI thought about that. But this would mean we need to execute the join query in two phases. The first phase would collect all the \"from\" values from the documents matching the encapsulated query. The second phase would match the documents that have matching on the \"to\" side with the \"from\" values collected in the first phase. The will work per segment and I think would also make the JoinQuery work in distributed environment. We can do this in a second development phase.\n\nI think you can use seekExact instead of seekCeil? Better performance...\nI'll change that.\n\nWhat is the AdjustedDISI for (and when would Weight.scorer get a top-level context...)? \nActually that is only used to map top level docids to segment docids (Basically doing: toplevel_docid - base). This is necessary because Weight.scorer works per segment and the query implementation not. ",

(So it's clear that\n    JoinQuery runs fromQuery using fromSearcher, joining on\n    fromSearcher.fromField to toSearcher.toField).\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy preComputedFromDocs...?  Like if you were to cache something,\n    wouldn't you want cache the toSearcher's bitset instead?\n\n\n\n\n\tMaybe rename JoinQueryWeight.joinResult to topLevelJoinResult, to\n    contrast it w/ the per-segment scoring?  And add a comment\n    explaining that we compute it once (on first segment) and all\n    later segments then reuse it?\n\n\n\n\n\tI wonder if we could make this a Filter instead, somehow?  Ie, at\n    its core it converts a top-level bitset in the fromSearcher doc\n    space into the joined bitset in the toSearcher doc space.  It\n    could even maybe just be a static method taking in fromBitset and\n    returning toBitset, which could operate per-segment on the\n    toSearcher side?  (Separately: I wonder if JoinQuery should do\n    something with the scores of the fromQuery....?  Not right now but\n    maybe later...).\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy does the JoinQuery javadoc say \"The downside of this\n    is that in a sharded environment not all documents might get\n    joined / linked.\" as a downside to the top-level approach?  Maybe\n    reword that to state that all joined to/from docs must reside in\n    the same shard?  In theory we could (later) make a shard friendly\n    approach?  Eg, first pass builds up all unique Terms in the\n    fromSearcher.fromField for docs matching the query (across all\n    shards) and 2nd pass is basically a TermFilter on those...\n\n\n\n\n\tNot sure it matters, but... including the preComputedFromDocs in\n    hashCode/equals is quite costly (it goes bit by bit...).  Maybe it\n    shouldn't be included, since it contains details about the\n    particular searcher that query had been run against?  (In theory\n    Query instances are searcher independent.)\n\n\n\nIn general I think this approach is somewhat inefficient, because it\nalways iterates over every possible term in fromSearcher.fromField,\nchecking the docs for each to see if there is a match in the query.\nIe, it's like FieldCache, in that it un-inverts, but it's uninverting\non every query.\n\nI wonder if we could DocTermOrds instead?  (Or,\nFieldCache.DocTermsIndex or DocValues.BYTES_*, if we know fromSearcher.fromField is\nsingle-valued).  This way we uninvert once (on init), and then doing\nthe join should be much faster since for each fromDocID we can lookup\nthe term(s) to join on.\n\nLikewise on the toSearcher side, if we had doc <-> ord/term loaded we\ncould do the forward (term -> ord) lookup quickly (in memory binary\nsearch).\n\nBut then this will obviously use RAM... so we should have the choice\n(and start w/ the current patch!).

SubReaderDISI?  ie, something to indicate it \"slices\" a sub-reader's portion of the top-level docID space) can then be used to translate back into a per-segment Filter.\n\nI think it would be cleaner as a Filter...?  This is actually similar to DuplicateFilter, which also must operate on top-level docIDs (since dups can happen in different segments).\n\nWould be nice if the user can choose between a more ram but faster variant and a less ram but slower variant.\n\nYeah I agree... but what worries me is just how slow this non-RAM version will be.  Ie, it must do the full join and uninvert every time; so even if your fromQuery only matches a tiny number of docs... you pay massive cost of the full join.  Even better than using FC/DV/DTO to map docID -> term(s) per query, we could hold in RAM the join result itself (docID -> docID(s)) in some form, then the query just directly maps the docIDs w/o having to lookup terms again.\n\nStepping back a bit... do we know how this impl compares to how ElasticSearch does joins?

In the case of Solr it is checking the filter cache.\n\nbut what worries me is just how slow this non-RAM version will be.\nI have been running the JoinQuery on my test data set (10.1 M docs) and it isn't as bad as I expect it would be. This data set contains 100000 products each product having 100 offers. The JoinQuery with a : query as fromQuery takes about 900 ms and a fromQuery selecting all products with a specific keyword takes about 350 ms. I think this specific query implementation is suitable for environments where RAM might be scarce. The RAM version should be the default.\n\nStepping back a bit... do we know how this impl compares to how ElasticSearch does joins? And to how Solr does...?\nES only has index time joining, right? Solr basically uses the same mechanism as the JoinQuery in this patch, but a bit smarter. It tries to cache the from term to to term lookup (see JoinQParserPlugin.java line 367). I couldn't port this part to joining module since this caching relies heavily on the SolrIndexSearcher. ",

I think its tricky and ugly. Maybe we can/should seek to 3.x TermEnum/FilteredTermEnum so this will work nicer...? I havent looked at how hairy this would be though.\n\tThe rewrites are not always per-segment like they are in trunk, and it could be bad to \"seek\" a lot when MTQ is in 'auto mode' because if I recall its expensive (creating lots of multitermsenums). Maybe since Join knows up-front how many terms are in the hash it should determine which method to use itself (setRewriteMethod)... maybe on 3.x just set filter rewrite since you know will be \"seeking\"? Since you return the query the user could still always override the rewrite method if they really care, it would just be a default.\n\n ",

During the first pass search all the terms are gathered for the matching documents based on the fromQuery. In the second pass search all documents are collected that match with the gather terms for a specific field. To only way I currently see how this can work in a distributed environment is that all machines in the cluster execute the first pass search and then copy the collected terms between machines. After this is done each machine can execute the second pass. If your data allows it, you can partition data in your cluster this allows you to skip the copying of terms. \n\nCurrently the api is just one static method and assumes that the joining happens locally. I think we need to have two more methods. One method that returns the first pass terms and one method that constructs a query based on terms from the first pass.\n\nRobert: Yes I see that 3.x MTQ isn't as great as MTQ in trunk. Maybe we need a different approach (not use MTQ)? The api is clean for users, and allows us to do joining different in 3x. I'll start backporting and see how well it goes. ",

This could generate a fair amount of garbage quickly.  \n\nAlso the sort compare using BRH is per byte (not as cheap as an ord compare).  We can probably use DocTermsIndex to replace the use of BytesRefHash by comparing DTI's ords.  Then we are saving off the bytes into BRH per query, and the comparison would be faster.\n\nAdditionally, for a join with many terms, the number of postings could become a factor in performance.  Because we are not caching bitsets like Solr does, it seems like an excellent occasion for a faster less-compressed codec.\n\nFurther, to save on term seeking, if the term state was cached (eg, the file pointers into the posting list), the iteration on the terms dict would be removed.\n\nGranted all this requires more RAM, however in many cases (eg, mine), that would be acceptable.

The TermsCollector caches the from terms via DocTerms in the FC (per segment). Caching can be improved in the second phase as you described, by saving a bitset per fromTerm?. But I think we first need to tackle how bitsets are cached in general. Solr caches (which the Solr JoinQuery uses) are top level (one commit and you lose it all). I'm unsure how to cache the posting list file pointers with the current Lucene api... I think this (joining) caching should be addressed in a new issue.\n\nPerformance of the JoinUtil looks actual quite good from what I have measured. I have a test data set containing 100000 products and 100 offers per product (10100000 docs in total).
