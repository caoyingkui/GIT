    "description": "I noted in a thread on the solr-user mailing list  https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/557347c2e22352ae3b2ccd9e9f22fbf8ce50d8efed901901adf020fc@%3Csolr-user.lucene.apache.org%3E that token graph filters (e.g. SynonymGraphFilter and WordDelimiterGraphFilter) can't handle input graphs, i.e. streams produced by other token graph filters.\n\nFrom the above-linked thread, Webster Homer wrote:\n\n\nI noticed that in some of the current example schemas that are shipped with\nSolr, there is a fieldtype, text_en_splitting, that feeds the output\nof SynonymGraphFilterFactory into WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory. So if\nthis isn't supported, the example should probably be updated or removed.\n\nWe should evaluate all analysis chains in shipped schemas to address this.",
