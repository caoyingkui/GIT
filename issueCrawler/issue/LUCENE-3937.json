When looking at the code part patched and the source of EnwikiContentSource, to simply provide the XML parser a Reader instead of InputStream, so the broken code is not triggered. This assumes, that the XML-file is always UTF-8.... If not it will no longer work (because the XML parser cannot switch encoding, if it only has a Reader).",
