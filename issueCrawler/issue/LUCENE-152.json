    "description": "September 10th 2003 contributionn from \"Sergio Guzman-Lara\" <guzman@cs.umass.edu>\n\nOriginal email:\n\nHi all,\n\n  I have ported the kstem stemmer to Java and incorporated it to \nLucene. You can get the source code (Kstem.jar) from the following website:\n\nhttp://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/\n\n  Just click on \"KStem Java Implementation\" (you will need to register \nyour e-mail, for free of course, with the CIIR --Center for Intelligent \nInformation Retrieval, UMass \u2013 and get an access code).\n\n\nContent of Kstem.jar:\n\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData1.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData2.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData3.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData4.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData5.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData6.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData7.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData8.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemFilter.java\njava/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemmer.java\n\nKStemData1.java, ..., KStemData8.java   Contain several lists of words \nused by Kstem\nKStemmer.java      Implements the Kstem algorithm \nKStemFilter.java     Extends TokenFilter applying Kstem\n\n\nTo compile\n\nunjar the file Kstem.jar to Lucene's \"src\" directory, and compile it \nthere. \n\n\nWhat is Kstem?\n\n  A stemmer designed by Bob Krovetz (for more information see \nhttp://ciir.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/ir-35.pdf). \n\n\nCopyright issues\n\n  This is open source. The actual license agreement is included at the \ntop of every source file.\n\n\n Any comments/questions/suggestions are welcome,\n\n\n  Sergio Guzman-Lara\n  Senior Research Fellow\n  CIIR UMass",

Other optimizations actually changed the logic and code paths though, which is one reason I tested it over a whole document to ensure it still matched the original. ",
