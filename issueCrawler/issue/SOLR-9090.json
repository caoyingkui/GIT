    "description": "solrj CloudSolrClient: add directUpdatesToLeadersOnly support\n\n(Marvin Justice, Christine Poerschke)\n\n\nProposed change:\n\n\tAddition of a directUpdatesToLeadersOnly flag to allow clients to request that direct updates be sent to the shard leaders and only to the shard leaders.\n\n\n\nMotivation:\n\n\tIn a scenario where there is temporarily no shard leader the update request will 'fail fast' allowing the client to handle retry logic.\n\n\n\nRelated tickets:\n\n\tSOLR-6312 concerns the ((currently) no longer used) updatesToLeaders flag. The updatesToLeaders logic however appears to be slightly different from the proposed directUpdatesToLeadersOnly logic: updatesToLeaders indicates that sending to leaders is preferred but not mandatory whereas directUpdatesToLeadersOnly mandates sending to leaders only.",
