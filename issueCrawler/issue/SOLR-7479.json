    "description": "Currently everytime a property/value is changed in solrcore.properties file, a core/collection reload is needed to pick up the new values. \n\nCore/Collection reloads for large collections (example 100 shards) is very expensive (performance wise) and can pose a threat to the collection stability (sometimes the reload fails since the timeout is only 60 seconds).For a RT serving infrastructure, this does not help\n\nWould adding a Real Time config api  (map) inside solrcloud help? Every solr core can pick up the core specific configs from this Shared Map. This can help with dynamically changing properties without core reloads. \n\nIf there is a better solution than that, please let me know",
