    "description": "The current process clears the entity caches once all root entity elements have been imported.  When a config file has dozens of root entities, the result is one \"idle in transaction\" process for each entity processed, effectively eating up the databases available connections.  The simple solution would be to clear a root entity's cache once that entity has been processed.\n\nThe following is a diff that I used in my instance to clear the cache when the entity completed:\n\n\u2014 DocBuilder.java\t2011-01-12 10:05:58.000000000 -0700\n+++ DocBuilder.java.new\t2011-01-12 10:05:31.000000000 -0700\n@@ -435,6 +435,9 @@\n         writer.log(SolrWriter.END_ENTITY, null, null);\n       }\n       entityProcessor.destroy();\n+\t\t\tif(entity.isDocRoot) \n{\n+\t\t\t\tentity.clearCache();\n+\t\t\t}\n     }\n   }",
