    "description": "The addition of the Solr map-reduce contrib created a new \"main.class\" property, which is used by the jarify task. Currently only the map-reduce plugin actually set this property, soall other generated JAR files contain the following line:\n\nMain-Class: ${main.class}\n\nThis happens because the ANT property \"main.class\" is undefined for most modules. Maybe this was added for one of the modules (I assume that the Solr-Morphline JARs use this attribute?). We should add some if/then/else structure to the <jarify/> task that only sets this property, if it is actually defined. Otherwise remove it (I think ANT does this automatically if its empty, means string-empty, have to try out)\n\nThis leads to an error if the file is double-clicked or started via java -jar:\n\n\nC:\\Users\\Uwe Schindler\\Desktop>java -jar lucene-core-4.7.0.jar\nFehler: Hauptklasse ${main.class} konnte nicht gefunden oder geladen werden\n\n\n\nI opened this issue in LUCENE, because jar files from LUCENE and SOLR are affected.",

The JAR file is not self-contained (means maven-shaded), so you cannot really start it with java -jar, because the classpath is not complete.\n\nMaybe remove the \"main.class\" stuff from <jarify/>?

Every module that wants to define something like the main-class manifest attribute can pass this directly as subelement to the macro.\n\nThe attached patch does this; as a result, only the Solr map-reduce contrib gets the Main-Class manifest entry in its jar's META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.\n\nI found that in order to pass nested elements through multiple layers of macros, I had to un- and re-wrap the nested elements, using different element names at each level - otherwise the final element gets placed at the wrong level and Ant bitches that it doesn't expect the final element.  So it's kludgy, but it works. ",
