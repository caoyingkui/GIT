    "description": "IndexInput now holds a private \"byte[] bytes\", which it re-uses for reading strings.  Likewise, IndexOutput holds a UTF8Result (which holds \"byte[] bytes\"), re-used for writing strings.\n\nThese are both dangerous, since on reading or writing immense strings, we never free this storage.\n\nWe don't use read/writeString in very perf sensitive parts of the code, so, I think we should not reuse the byte[] at all.\n\nI think this is likely the cause of the recent \"IndexWriter and memory usage\" thread, started by Ross Woolf on java-user@.",
