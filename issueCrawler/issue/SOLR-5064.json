            "content": "Hi,\n\nIt would be nice to update your Woodstock version since the artifactId has changed (wstx-asl to woodstox-core-asl), so even when someone want to use the latest org.codehaus.woodstox:woodstox-core-asl:4.4.1 by defining this dependency explicitly, he got both woodstox-core-asl and wstx-asl in the classpath.\n\nI am currently adding support for Jackson based XML serialization to Spring Boot. This feature require latest woodstox-core-asl version, but since Spring Boot and Spring Data integrate solr-solrj, we have to exclude wstx-asl and add manually a dependency on woodstox-core-asl, that's not very nice.\n\nThanks in advance for your help,\nS\u00e9bastien "

            "content": "BTW; just wanted to mention that the last time I looked, Woodstox is not in fact actually explicitly used by SolrJ; it is used indirectly simply by being on the classpath.  But Java comes with implementations of StAX, so Woodstox is not actually needed.  Once upon a time, like back in Java 1.6 (or maybe it was 1.5), somebody here saw that Woodstox was a lot faster than Java's impl, and so it was included.  I suspect Java's impl has improved a lot since then.  I think it's very dubious to include this dependency in SolrJ, particularly with our Javabin default codec.  SolrJ should have minimal dependencies because every Solr client out there has to use it and integrate with their dependencies. "
