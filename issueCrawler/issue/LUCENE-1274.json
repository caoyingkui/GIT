    "description": "Currently when IndexWriter commits, it does so with a two-phase\ncommit, internally: first it prepares all the new index files, syncs\nthem; then it writes a new segments_N file and syncs that, and only if\nthat is successful does it remove any now un-referenced index files.\n\nHowever, these two phases are done privately, internal to the commit()\nmethod.\n\nBut when Lucene is involved in a transaction with external resources\n(eg a database), it's very useful to explicitly break out the prepare\nphase from the commit phase.\n\nSpinoff from this thread:\n\n  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-dev/200804.mbox/%3C16627610.post@talk.nabble.com%3E",

If you call this, then\nIndexWriter is left in a mode where a commit is pending.  You must\nfollow this up either with a call to rollback(), which reverts all\nchanges done since you first opened IndexWriter and closes it, or\ncommit(), which completes the transaction.  prepareCommit() requires\nthat IndexWriter is opened with autoCommit false.\n ",
