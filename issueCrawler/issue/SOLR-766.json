The existing client\nwas not sufficiently maintained or tested as development of Solr progressed, and committers\nfelt that the code was not up to our usual high standards of release.\n\nThe client bundled with previous versions of Solr will continue to be available indefinitely at:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/solr/tags/release-1.2.0/client/python/\n\nPlease see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolPython for information on third-party Solr python\nclients.\n "
