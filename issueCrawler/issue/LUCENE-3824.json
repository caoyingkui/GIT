    "description": "We now have logic to fall back to by-value comparison, when the bottom\nslot is not from the current reader.\n\nBut this is silly, because if the bottom slot is from a different\nreader, it means the tie-break case is not possible (since the current\nreader didn't have the bottom value), so when the incoming ord equals\nthe bottom ord we should always return x > 0.\n\nI added a new random string sort test case to TestSort...\n\nI also renamed DocValues.SortedSource.getByValue -> getOrdByValue and\ncleaned up some whitespace.",
