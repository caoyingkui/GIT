    "description": "As mentioned on the list, I propose we move the JDK-based CollationKeyFilter/CollationKeyAnalyzer, currently located in contrib/collation into core for collation support (language-sensitive sorting)\n\nThese are not much code (the heavy duty stuff is already in core, IndexableBinaryString). \n\nAnd I would also like to move the ICUCollationKeyFilter/ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer (along with the jar file they depend on) also currently located in contrib/collation into a contrib/icu.\n\nThis way, we can start looking at integrating other functionality from ICU into a fully-fleshed out icu contrib.",

Similar maybe to what happened with NumericRange. Just not sure how this would work yet... ",
