This here would revert a small number of those info-to-debug changes but the changes are very selective and targetted at code paths that should not happen on a regular basis (e.g. am_i_leader unclear) or that happen infrequently i.e. overseer leadership transition. What do you think? ",

I'm not sure if overseer debugging is something so common that we should bog down everyone with those low-level logs? Anyone who had Overseer issues once or twice and want to catch the next one could of course configure log4j2.xml if they don't want to run verbose (-v) for all of Solr.\n\nThat said, I have not analysed the proposed patch in detail. If you can isolate the added logging to log events that will only occur during transition then it may be ok. But I don't want another of those log lines spamming the startup sequence or popping up every second just to say \"I'm alive\". Also see related\u00a0SOLR-12456 which I just filed to try to get rid of spammy\u00a0DEBUG-level logging from the overseer. ",

If you can isolate the added logging to log events that will only occur during transition ...\nYes, that is the intention \u2013 the logging is intended to assist not hinder and ideally to assist out-of-the-box when someone hits overseer issues for the first time e.g. due to (external) zookeeper hiccups of some sort.\n\nIn lieu of integration or regression tests, I just attached the overseer-scenario-run.sh script I wrote for my own use to more easily explore the scenarios i.e. download and unpack zookeeper, start external zookeeper, start solr cloud, trigger overseer transition, stop solr, stop zookeeper \u2013 that kind of thing.\n\nMy next intended step is to consider both the proposed info as well as the existing info logging for Overseer.java e.g. the Overseer (id=null) closing logging emitted at the start of apparently every solr node seems confusing?\n... don't want another of those log lines spamming the startup sequence or popping up every second just to say \"I'm alive\". ...\nI agree. Spammy logging can hinder log interpretation and troubleshooting.\n... Also see related SOLR-12456 which I just filed ...\nGood find, thanks! ",
