Since this is the first time I've seen any kind of issue like this I suspect you've done something unfortunate in your installation. When you talk about adding lib directives to solrconfig.xml, I suspect you're trying to mix Solr 5 jars with Solr 4 jars which won't work.\n\nI'm closing this on the theory it's not a bug in Solr, we can re-open if necessary (after this gets discussed on the user's list).\n\nTry this:\nShut down Solr\nInstall a fresh 5.5 in another directory\nstart up the fresh 5.5 with SOLR_HOME set to the same thing it was in Solr 4.x ",
