    "description": "I often find it to be quite the hassle to go via Analyzer in order to add offset/position gaps when adding data the the same field name.\n\nThis patch introduce IndexableField#positionIncrementGap and #offsetGap, which at index time is added to the value gathered from the correlating Analyzer#methods. \n\n\nNo tests in here, yet, but first a question: am I missing something important in the design of Lucene here? Why is this not already a feature?",
