In that case the lexicographic order of the value will be used to break the tie. It is possible that facet values are returned in a different order for distributed and local setups.\n\nThe patch also adds a unit test, commented out because of the issues described above. "

Optimising the combining of sorted data from the shards can't be done in the general case, as e.g. for sort by count the data returned affects the order \u2013 merging the results from 2 shards can change the order completely compared because you're adding up the counts.\n\nIf you specify facet.sort=false in a non-distributed setup, the facet values are ordered by term number as well \u2013 which happens to be the lexicographic order.

Facet terms outside the window may actually be inside the window (or above it, changing the order).  The code calculates what terms (out of all those returned) could possibly change what the window looks like, taking into account the maximum value it could have for each shard based on what it saw from each.\n\nFor facets sorted by index order, the window into the list will not change based on any facet refinements.  Actually, we should remove any amount of \"over-requesting\" when sorting by index order.  The counts could be off though... we may not have the counts from certain shards.  So we only have to request counts when:\n\n\tthe term is in the window to be returned\n\tthe term is missing from a shard, and that term comes after the last term the shard returned.\n\n "

Term order as such probably doesn't make a lot of sense, it's really used to get the terms in alphabetical order. So why not drop term order altogether and introduce lexicographic order instead. This probably also means changing the facet.sort parameter from a boolean to a string \u2013 \"count\" or \"lex\".\n\nThis would mean that the same query will return the same results for both distributed and non-distributed setups. The downside is that the facets always need to be sorted (i.e. more computation), but according to Wojtek's measurements this seems to be neglible.\n\nIf this seems like the right direction to go to, we should probably open another issue for this.
