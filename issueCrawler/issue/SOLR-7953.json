    "description": "When using the QueryElevationComponent, using the [elevated] docTransformer doesn't always work.  In the case the document is a LazyDocument, BaseEditorialTransformer#getKey will return the LazyField.toString() which is Object#toString() which of course isn't going to match any of the uniqueKeys.  The fix is to change getKey to check instanceof IndexableField instead of just Field.  I'm not sure the impact of this bug because I don't know how often LazyDocuments get used.",
