            "content": "a cursory glance at the code in o.a.l.gdata.utils.DateFormater indicates that two SimpleDateFormater format strings are used ... they are both documented as \"Date format as it is used in Http Last modified header\", the only difference being between little z and big Z for timezones.\n\nwhile servers are generally suppose to be lenient in parsing, formating of dates is always suppose to end in \" GMT\", so it seems that a maybe a setTimeZone cll on the formater when constructed is in order?\n ",

If I put in the Date above (which caused a failure) as a test on my machine it passes.\n\nI think the error is actually in the test in that the Pattern that is used to compare the output does not account for the GMT offset method for time zones.\n\nThoughts?  If not, I will put in a fix for the Regex to account for the GMT offset method. ",
