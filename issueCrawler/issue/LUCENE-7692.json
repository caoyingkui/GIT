I think PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory qualifies?\n\nFor the record, we have MappingCharFilterFactory that does a similar job (except that it takes an explicit map of replacements  rather than regular expressions) and implements MultiTermAware.",

Frankly, my motivation was that explaining over and over again that \"wildcard searches are case sensitive because....\" got really tiring so just fixing that use-case was enough to get us going, the rest was an added benefit \n\nSince then it's more have been added but mostly whenever someone was motivated to add another, so please feel free.
