    "description": "ParametricRangeQueryNodeProcessor currently works as follows:\n\n\n\tIf the operator was LE or GE, set inclusive = true.\n\tSet up a calendar\n\tIf inclusive, set the second time to 23:59:59:999\n\tConvert that to a string using the DateResolution.\n\n\n\nThe problem is, this breaks for exclusive queries.  For instance, if the user types in \n{20100110 TO 20100120}\n they would expect to get the 10th to the 20th exclusive, i.e. the 11th to the 19th.  But in reality, the 10th will be inclusive.\n\nTo get an actually-exclusive range for the lower bound, the time should be set to 23:59:59:999, much the same as what is done for the inclusive upper bound.\n\nI suspect the original query parser has the same issue, though possibly in different words.",
