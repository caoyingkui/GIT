Each sub class overrides methods `getSecurityConfig`, `getConf`, `persistConf` and `securityConfEdited`:\n\t`SecurityConfHandlerZk` is instantiated if zkAware\n\t`SecurityConfHandlerLocal` is instantiated if in local mode, reads/writes local file in SOLR_HOME\n\tIn local mode there is no callback when `security.json` changes, so `SecurityConfHandlerLocal` explicitly reloads security configs in its `securityConfEdited()` method\n\t`MockSecurityHandler` used in tests persists to in-memory Map\n\tNew object `SecurityConfig` to hold security config, since `ZkStateReader.ConfigData` is tied to ZK.\n\tNew test case `BasicAuthStandaloneTest` spins up Jetty, writes local `security.json` through the persistConf API, adds a user through edit API, validates that permission is enforced and that local file contains user name.\n\n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/cominvent/lucene-solr solr9481\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/95.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #95\n\n\ncommit 6c04d63e633f74b4df9f77ad78b2335d9dd87470\nAuthor: Jan H\u00f8ydahl <janhoy@apache.org>\nDate:   2016-10-13T08:46:30Z\n\n    SOLR-9481: Authentication and Authorization plugins now work in standalone mode, including edit API\n\n ",

Which means that if you set up the interceptors the way you want for one server, create the HttpClient and the SolrClient, then clear the interceptors and set up a second HttpClient/SolrClient, BOTH clients will use the new list.
