    "description": "For my use case I need both suggesters: AnalyzingSuggester and FuzzySuggester because FuzzySuggester does not boost terms with minimal Levenshtein distance. \nPost processing of FuzzySuggester results is somewhat heavy if only one wants to find direct prefix suggestions. So I first use AnalyzingSuggester to find prefix suggestions and optionally FuzzySuggester afterwards if AnaylzingSuggester did not yield appropriate results.\n\nIt would be really useful if FuzzySuggester could boost/sort suggestion results in order of Levenshtein distances. Then I only would need FuzzySuggester.",
