    "description": "SimplePostTool.postData() takes a Long length arg that is sometimes null \u2013 for stdin and for processing some web pages for links.  If it's null, we should this on the underlying HttpURLConnection:\nurlc.setChunkedStreamingMode(-1);.  I have found that I can't use bin/post to stream large files from stdin since it the JDK's implementation wants to put the whole thing in memory first.  Sadly this is true of curl as well.  When I set chunk mode, it works.  (FYI -1 tells it to use its default chunk size \u2013 4k).\n\nFYI I'm using stdin because I've got massive JSON files zipped up.",
