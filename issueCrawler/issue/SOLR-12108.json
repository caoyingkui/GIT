    "description": "discovered this while working on SOLR-11891...\n\nThe RawValueTransformerFactory class is suppose to treat the field value as a normal string in situations where an instance is limited by the wt param (which it is automatically for the default [json] and [xml] transformers.\n\nThis is currently implemented by RawValueTransformerFactory.create() assuming it can just return \"null\" if the ResponseWriter in use doesn't match - but because of how this transformer abuses the \"key\" to implicitly indicate the field to be returned (ie: my_json_fieldName:[json], it means that nothing about the resulting ReturnFields datastructure indicates that the field (my_json_fieldName) should be returned at all.\n\nBecause of the existing sloppy code in SOLR-11891, that means this bug in ChildDocumentTransformer only impacts current users if the documentCache is disabled\n\nExample steps to reproduce w/techproducts config assuming solrconfig.xml is edited to disable documentCache...\n\n\n$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/update?commit=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"1\",\n    \"raw_s\":\"{\\\"raw\\\":\\\"json\\\"}\" } ]'\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":39}}\n$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/query?wt=json&q=id:1&fl=raw_s'\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":2,\n    \"params\":{\n      \"q\":\"id:1\",\n      \"fl\":\"raw_s\",\n      \"wt\":\"json\"}},\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":1,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[\n      {\n        \"raw_s\":\"{\\\"raw\\\":\\\"json\\\"}\"}]\n  }}\n$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/query?wt=json&q=id:1&fl=raw_s:%5Bjson%5D'\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":0,\n    \"params\":{\n      \"q\":\"id:1\",\n      \"fl\":\"raw_s:[json]\",\n      \"wt\":\"json\"}},\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":1,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[\n      {\n        \"raw_s\":{\"raw\":\"json\"}}]\n  }}\n$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/query?wt=xml&q=id:1&fl=raw_s:%5Bjson%5D'\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<response>\n\n<lst name=\"responseHeader\">\n  <int name=\"status\">0</int>\n  <int name=\"QTime\">0</int>\n  <lst name=\"params\">\n    <str name=\"q\">id:1</str>\n    <str name=\"fl\">raw_s:[json]</str>\n    <str name=\"wt\">xml</str>\n  </lst>\n</lst>\n<result name=\"response\" numFound=\"1\" start=\"0\">\n  <doc></doc>\n</result>\n</response>",
