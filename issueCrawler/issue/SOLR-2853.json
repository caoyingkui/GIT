            "content": "Matt,\n\nThanks for taking such a deep dive into this code.  Its great to see people checking for things like this.  I think the current code is correct, however.  What PossibilityIterator is returning is a set of word combinations that SpellCheckCollator then needs to test against the index.  So PossibilityIterator will return up to \"maxTries\" word combinations.  But some of these possibilities could be nonsense and will return 0 hits when queried for against the index. SpellCheckCollator will throw these 0-hit possibilities out, trying each possibility until it has as many good ones as requested by \"maxCollations\", or until it has exhausted the list.  (If the user sets maxCollationTries to zero, SpellCheckCollator won't test any and in this case will just return the first \"maxCollations\" possibilities back to the user.)  Make sense?  "

            "content": "Ahh yes, that makes sense.  I was under the assumption that one might want up to a \"maxCollations\" of possibilities returned, instead of just the first one, even if \"maxTries\" is zero.  But thanks that clears up my issue.\n\n No problem looking into code, it's very interesting work. "

            "content": "Matt,\n\nActuall, if you wouldn't mind, could you re-open this one (I can't), or otherwise I can open another issue.  Taking a closer look after reading your last comment, there is a bug in the case the user sets \"maxCollationTries\" to 0.  In SpellCheckCollator, we have:\n\n\nif (maxTries < 1) {\n  maxTries = 1;\n  verifyCandidateWithQuery = false;\n}\n\n\n\nBut I think in this case we need it to set \"maxTries\" to the same value as \"maxCollations\".  The current code will, as you point out, only return 1 collation no mater how many the user specified, unless \"maxTries\" > 0.  I would think most users who want multiple collations would also want them verified, so this is probably not something that would get easily caught.  An extra test case might be prudent as well.\n "
