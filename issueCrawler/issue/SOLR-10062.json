    "description": "Hello,\n\nWe are registering an EVentListener for the data import end event and it would be very helpful to reach the information concerning the status of the data importer through the context object received.\n\ndataImporter in unfortunatelly a private field in ContextImpl and there is no getter in order to reach to it.\nIt would be helpful to be able to reach to dataImporter.getStatusMessages()\n\nThe workaround right now is to send another http request to get this information.\n\nThank you in advance,\nAndreea Ardelean",
