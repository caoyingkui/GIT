    "description": "core.reload() creates two searchers, one when creating the new core and one after creating the new IW. For each of those searchers it calls the registered listeners, however, depending on how long the first searcher takes to warm it may call the \u201cfirstSearcher\u201d events twice.\nProbably the best solution would be to not even create the first of the searchers.",
