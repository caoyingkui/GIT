            "content": "Here is a patch to fix this.\n\nThe whole problem everywhere in solr (even for config files) is, that XML files per spec are not intended to be handled a \"text\", they are binary!!! (this is why the MIME type is application/xml and text/xml was deprecated by IANA).\n\nThe APIs provided by Java that take java.io.Reader are only convenience methods to support parsing strings or database contents that are in text contents with already detected CharSet. XML files from unknown source must always be parsed as a byte-stream. Charsets determined from HTTP headers may only be used as a hint to the parser.\n\nThe patch changes the XmlUpdateRequestHandler to use the byte stream and pass the charset from Content-Type header as a hint to the parser.\n\nThis patch still misses a test.\n\nIn general we should review all XML parsing in solr and never ever use java.io.Reader!!!

So text/xml mime-type without charset only affects currently proxies or other components inbetween that may transform the charset during the HTTP processing.\n\nXML parsers by definition only take a byte stream and a charset hint and use the XML 1.0 spec to determince the charset: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charencoding and http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-guessing "
