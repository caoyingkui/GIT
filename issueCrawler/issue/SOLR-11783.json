Is there any chance you could give Solr 7.2 a try and see if the behavior persists?\n\nIf that doesn't fix the problem, please include an example of a core.properties file that is incorrect. Unfortunately \"core name\" is a bit ambiguous, there's coreNodeName, name, etc.... ",

Go to <install_dir>/solr-7.1.0/solr/\n2. Start techproducts example (./bin/solr -e techproducts)\n3. Rename core (e.g. via solr UI or core admin api)\n4. Check persistence (cat example/techproducts/solr/techproducts/core.properties)\n\nThe core.properties file still holds the old core name (name=techproducts)\n\nPerforming the same steps with solr 6.3.0 works as expected, i.e. the core.properties file holds the new core name.

Then I stopped Solr and started it back up with the bin\\solr command used by the \"-e\" option.  Because core.properties hadn't been updated, the core name was back to techproducts, as the issue describes.\n\nThen I tried to change the core name again to \"foo\" but it told me \"New name must be different from the current one\" ... which is really really odd, particularly because Solr was restarted and the core was NOT named foo.
