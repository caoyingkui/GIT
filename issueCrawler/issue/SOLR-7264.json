            "content": "So, are booleans just stored as in int in Lucene?\n\nhow lucene \"stores\" values is ambigiuous when talking about datatimes, and not particularly relevant when talking about DocValues.  I think the point rmuir was making is that lucene doesn't have any special low level support for boolean values in the DocValues api is because (if i remember correctly) there isn't really any reason to do so \u2013 when the DocValues for a field are all small int values (like \"0\" and \"1\") then the automatic encoding/compression of those values is just as efficient as if there was special single bit support.\n\nSo yes: if you patch BoolField to implement the appropriate methods for supporting docValues and you do so by using (int)1 for true and (int)0 for false that should work fine and be plenty efficient.

Take a look at DocValuesTest.java, DocValuesMissingTest.java, and DocValuesMultiTest.java (and the corresponding schema files) for examples of the bare bones basics we should be sanity checking are working properly with the new code.
