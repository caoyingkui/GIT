    "description": "When post.jar is used with a custom URL (e.g. for multi-core), it silently ignores -Dparams flag and requires parameters to be appended directly to -Durl value.\n\nThe problem is the following code:\nString params = System.getProperty(\"params\", \"\");\nurlStr = System.getProperty(\"url\", SimplePostTool.appendParam(DEFAULT_POST_URL, params));\n\nThe workaround exists (by using -Durl=\"http://customurl?param1=value&param2=value\"), but it is both undocumented as a special case and clunky as Url and params may be coming from different places. It would be good to have this consistent.",

I am trying to use this for an example and it is very clunky with the current workaround:\njava -Dauto -Durl=\"http://localhost:8983/solr/multivalued/update?f.to.split=true&f.to.separator=;\" -jar post.jar multivalued/multivalued.csv \n\nThe example should be out after 4.1, but it will not wait until 4.2....\n\nThe change should be trivial, something like:\n-------------\nurlStr = System.getProperty(\"url\")\nif (urlStr == null)\n{\n  urlStr = SimplePostTool.appendParam(DEFAULT_POST_URL, params);\n}\nelse\n{\n  urlStr = SimplePostTool.appendParam(urlStr, params);\n}\n-------------\n\nI just don't have the environment setup to do full patch myself yet.
