Further I think it is important to not imply any place where we check this in the name ie. if you have flush in the name we should check on flush and should not make the decision ahead of time which we might want to do in the future. For instance you have set it to true and then set it to false afterwards but we already checked the boolean and wrapped the Directory in a CFSDirectory which might be confusing. \n\nI actually think it's a good thing to have this in two different places since those are two different usecases ie. for merges you might not want CFS at all but for new writes you want it because NRT can flush / write lots of segments. The defaults on MP are for merging and the defaults on IWC are for indexing. Btw. I think useCompoundFileOnWrite is a good fit?!\n\nHow complicated is it to keep on MP only?\n\nI'd really appreciate to move it out of MP. it's not a merge setting and I think it's rather confusing today since we take the merge setting and use it for indexing. Aside of this, I think this is pretty expert too. Adding a boolean for this to MP would feel odd and I think it's the wrong thing as well. ",

It's not enough to set useCFS(true) on MP, but you also need to set it to IWC. So now we have 3 settings: mp.setUseCFS(), mp.setNoCFSRatio() and iwc.setUseCFSOnWrite. That's too much, no?\n\nWorse thing is, if I do want to control CFS, how can I tell that IWC is not enough? At least when everything is on MP, or on any other class I don't care, I get a hint from auto-complete or reading jdocs.\n\nI understand that the two settings are different, but the API is already there today and the changes don't simplify it IMO. If it's a concurrency thing you want to solve, IW / DWPT can read that setting in the ctor and never access MP again. I prefer to leave the API clear. ",

That's too much, no?\nThinking out loud... I couldn't agree more, I think mp.setUseCFS() should go away entirely and we should only use setNonCFSRatio() to control for merges. 0.0 would mean no CFS in that case. on IWC we just use the setting from the MP as the default ie. if you disable it we also disable it in the IWC unless it's set explicitly via a setter. That means we are back to 2 settings, MP implies the setting on IWC... \n\nYet, the MP settings are impl details and not part of the interface at all (which is ok I think?) would we awesome if we could clean this up even further in the future \n ",

So we end with IWC.setCFS (defaults to true) and MP.setNoCFSRatio (default is per impl?). And that's it? If want to turn off CFS entirely, you do it in two places, but that's really expert. Otherwise we default to CFS and you only need to decide whether you want merged segments to be CFS or not, which is the more important decision I think. ",
