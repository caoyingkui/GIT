    "description": "Hi Karl Wright,\n\nI was thinking in the limitation of convexity for circle planes and I worked out another approach that overcome this limitation. There is a condition, circle lanes must contain the center of the circle which is probably always true for planets like WGS84 which are not too far from the sphere.\n\nThe idea is create a short of polygon for every slice using the center of the circle (like an orange) and therefore you can treat them separately. I attached what I developed, it seems to pass all tests regardless of the radius.\n\nLet me know what you think and if I am missing something.",

I honestly don't know how that could work.  Otherwise it looks identical (functionally) to the existing code.  Why do you think the backing plane was unnecessary?\n\n ",

            "content": "Looking at the \"isWithin\" code here:\n\n\n   @Override\n   public boolean isWithin(final double x, final double y, final double z) {\n-    if (circlePlanes == null) {\n+    if (circleSlices.size() == 0) {\n       return true;\n     }\n-    for (final Membership plane : circlePlanes) {\n-      final Membership backPlane = (backBounds==null)?null:backBounds.get(plane);\n-      if (backPlane == null || backPlane.isWithin(x, y, z)) {\n-        if (!plane.isWithin(x, y, z)) {\n-          return false;\n-        }\n-      }\n-    }\n-    return true;\n+    for (final CircleSlice slice : circleSlices) {\n+      if (slice.circlePlane.isWithin(x, y, z) && slice.plane1.isWithin(x, y, z) && slice.plane2.isWithin(x, y, z)) {\n+        return true;\n+      }\n+    }\n+    return false;\n   }\n\n\n\nBasically, the circle is divided into sectors.  The sector edges must go through the center of the circle and the center of the world.  The potential problems come in because each sector meets the line from the circle center to the center of the world at a different point.  As long as that point is not actually outside of the world, though, that is fine, since we're describing a Geo shape that resides on the surface of the world, not underneath.\n\nSo I see how this works and I agree that it is an improvement, although I also think we will need to have code that detects when we're building sectors that are illegal.

            "content": "Yes, the circle is divided into sectors and therefore there is no dependency between the concavity/convexity of the circle planes. I agree we should add a check to make sure the center of the circle is WITHIN the circle plane. Luckily it seems it is always true for WSG84.\n\nJust for the record, I haven seen test failing  when the circle is close to Math.PI (I think the limit for WSG84 is 0.9995 * Math.PI) but I think that is because Vincenty's formula does not converge close to antipodals points. We might need to do something in that case and it probably depends on the planet model.\n\nThanks!  ",
