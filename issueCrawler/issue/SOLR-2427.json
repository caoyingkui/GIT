That makes little sense, though, now that I have reconsidered it, so I'll drop maven publishing of the Solr-specific uima-core jar.  The other UIMA SNAPSHOT dependencies, however, will need to be published as Solr-specific versions, since the maven central repository rejects POMs with SNAPSHOT dependencies. "

So I'm not sure what happened here, but the jar in Solr's source tree was definitely not the same as the released jar.  Maybe the released 2.3.1 jar you posted was never committed?  I don't know.\n\nAnyway, it's fixed now.\n\nThanks for taking care.\n\nNo problem. "
