My proposal is to not change existing behaviour i.e. to have something added in the default solr.in.sh and anyone wanting to alter the default behavior would then edit-or-remove the solr.in.sh default.

It should also still work to change the log-level using -v and -q as well as -Dsolr.log.level=ERROR\n\nbin/solr start -f -v  # for verbose/DEBUG output\nbin/solr start -f -q  # for quiet/WARN output\nbin/solr start -f -Dsolr.log.level=ERROR  # for ERROR\n ",
