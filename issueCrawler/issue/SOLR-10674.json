    "description": "In earlier versions of Solr, unloading a core caused it's core.properties file to be renamed to something like core.properties.unloaded. The current behavior (observed in 6.3.0 and 6.5.1, running in non-cloud mode) is to delete core.properties, which is extremely inconvenient if it is anticipated that the core will be reloaded.\n\nhere's the logfile entry for the unload request\nINFO  - 2017-05-11 09:39:23.960; [   ] org.apache.solr.servlet.HttpSolrCall; [admin] webapp=null path=/admin/cores params=\n{core=dev0510&action=UNLOAD&wt=json&_=1494513368797}\n status=0 QTime=624\n\nPlease consider restoring the  previous behavior.",
