    "description": "From LUCENE-3151 (Robert Muir's comments): there is no need for the Analyzer to take in an IndexableField object.  We can simplify this API:\n\nHey Grant: I know it sounds silly but can we split out the getOffsetGap API change into a separate issue?\nThis would be nice to fix ASAP.\n\nI dont understand why it takes IndexableField or took Fieldable. All the other methods here like\ngetPositionIncrementGap take \"String fieldName\". I think this one should too.\n\nI dont think it needs a boolean for tokenized either: returning a 0 for NOT_ANALYZED fields. \nIf you choose NOT_ANALYZED, that should mean the Analyzer is not invoked!\n\nIf you want to do expert stuff control the offset gaps between values for NOT_ANALYZED fields, \nthen just analyze it instead, with keyword tokenizer!",
