    "description": "There's no explicit option to run DataImportHandler in a synchronous mode / blocking call. It could be useful to run DIH from SolrJ ( EmbeddedSolrServer ) in the same thread. Currently one can pass dummy stream (or enable debug mode) as a workaround to achieve the same behavior, but I think it makes sense to add specific option for that.",
