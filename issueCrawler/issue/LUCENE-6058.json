    "description": "We have just recently released commons-codec 1.10 and I wanted to inform you that there have been slight changes to the Beider Morse encoder.\n\nThis might result in slightly different encodings (see CODEC-187). At least one unit test has to be adjusted when updating.\n\nThe results of the Beider Morse encoder are now identical to the reference implementation of the algorithm (v3.4, http://stevemorse.org/census/soundex.html), it might be necessary to inform users before upgrading as they might have to re-index to get consistent results.",
