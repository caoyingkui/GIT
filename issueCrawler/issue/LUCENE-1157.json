I.e. where to put the generated file?\n\nOne option is to add it to svn (when the release is closed), and link to it e.g. like this:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/branches/lucene_2_3/Changes.html?view=co\nBut then future changes to the branch are likely to forget updating this file...\n\nSteven, what do you think of this?

AFAICT, the per-release documentation is created as part of the release process.\n\nThat leaves the question of whether to include HTML versions of CHANGES.txt for previous releases - my vote is to do so.\n\nThat makes 4 different classes of location for Changes.html:\n\n\n\tCurrent trunk view, linked from developers' documentation. (done)\n\tLatest release view, linked from the non-versioned site.\n\tPer-release view for releases going forward - contains changes only up to the release.\n\tPer-release view for previous releases - contains changes only up to the release.\n\n ",
