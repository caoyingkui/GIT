    "description": "This stems from issues with SOLR-2588, moving the Velocity response writer back to contrib.  We still want the example app to use the VelocityResponseWriter for the /browse interface.  Many of Solr's core tests use the example Solr configuration.  There are other contribs that are brought into the example app (extract, clustering, DIH, for examples) but these are request handlers that lazy load.  Response writers don't currently lazy load, thus causing core tests that use the example config to fail unless \"ant dist\" is run.",
