At this moment i am trying to execute the \nfollowing query:\n\n      \"Gesproken dagblad\" AND \"ROODE DEKENS\".\n\nBut Lucene does not return any hit (even the words are into the same document \nin the index).\n\nBut, if I use OR operator, then i can get the hits without any problem.\nIf I do execute each query apart (\"Gesproken dagblad\" in one query and \"ROODE \nDEKENS\" in another query), then I get into the results the same document.\n\nDoes anyone knows what can be exactly the problem?\n\nKind Regards\n\nKike",
