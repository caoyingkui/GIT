    "description": "Today, SegmentMerger opens up all the norms/docvalues and calls merge on the codec.\n\nCan we improve this? In general these things are lazy-loaded, but it would be nice for example, in the case of norms or memory docvalues, to not actually load up things into their hashmap during merging (this would be just a few lines of code), or maybe in the future, even stream the data from disk if not loaded already.\n\nThis would help a lot with RAM spikes during merging, which can happen if someone has a lot of \"latent\" norms, e.g. fields they rarely search on.",
