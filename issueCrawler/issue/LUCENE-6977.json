    "description": "We ran across an issue in a custom token filter that like the StemmerOverrideFilter relies on the FST. The issue is reproducible in the StemmerOverrideFilter. I am not sure whether it is a real problem in the FST.\n\nAttached a patch with a unit test that is going to fail. It uses random input with some code from commons-lang3.",

            "content": "Well it is a bit difficult to explain. I've written a unit test that sends loads random strings in the filter. Each input has a fixed output, named 'stuff'. Looks like this filter config file:\n\n\nrandom_input_a stuff\nrandom_input_b stuff\nrandom_input_c stuff\nrandom_input_d stuff\nrandom_input_e stuff\n...\n...\n\ubb8c?\ufb21\ubd44\uc842\u266a\u4f5e\u1349\u394d\u85a5 stuff\n..\n..\netc etc\n\n\nAll inputs listed should output stuff, no matter what. But it doesn't work for some random strings, they are soemhow not recognized. For example, the random generated input \ubb8c?\ufb21\ubd44\uc842\u266a\u4f5e\u1349\u394d\u85a5 is not recognized, i do not get 'stuff' as output. Please run the testCrappyInputFailure() unit test, it inputs 50.000 random strings, it usually fails at some point. "
