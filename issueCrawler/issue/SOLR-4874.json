            "content": "From: Andy Lester andy@petdance.com \nSent: Tuesday, May 28, 2013 2:29 PM\nTo: solr-user@lucene.apache.org\nSubject: Why do FQs make my spelling suggestions so slow?\n\nI'm working on using spellcheck for giving suggestions, and collations\nare giving me good results, but they turn out to be very slow if\nmy original query has any FQs in it.  We can do 100 maxCollationTries\nin no time at all, but if there are FQs in the query, things get\nvery slow.  As maxCollationTries and the count of FQs increase,\nthings get very slow very quickly.\n\n         1    10    20    50   100 MaxCollationTries\n0FQs     8     9    10    11    10\n1FQ     11   160   599  1597  1668\n2FQs    20   346  1163  3360  3361\n3FQs    29   474  1852  5039  5095\n4FQs    36   589  2463  6797  6807\nAll times are QTimes of ms.  With spellcheck off I get 8ms for 4fq query.  I can do maxCollation = maxCollationTries = 100 and it comes back in 14ms, so long as I have FQs off.  Add a single FQ and it becomes 13499ms.  I can do maxCollation = maxCollationTries = 1000 and it comes back in 45ms, so long as I have FQs off.  Add a single FQ and it becomes 62038ms.\n\nHere's a query that I've been using as a test:\ndf=title_tracings_t&\nfl=flrid,nodeid,title_tracings_t&\nq=bagdad+AND+diaries+AND+-parent_tracings:(bagdad+AND+diaries)&\nspellcheck.q=bagdad+AND+diaries&\nrows=4&\nwt=xml&\nsort=popular_score+desc,+grouping+asc,+copyrightyear+desc,+flrid+asc&\nspellcheck=true&\nspellcheck.dictionary=direct&\nspellcheck.onlyMorePopular=false&\nspellcheck.count=15&\nspellcheck.extendedResults=false&\nspellcheck.collate=true&\nspellcheck.maxCollations=10&\nspellcheck.maxCollationTries=50&\nspellcheck.collateExtendedResults=true&\nspellcheck.alternativeTermCount=5&\nspellcheck.maxResultsForSuggest=10&\ndebugQuery=off&\nfq=((grouping:\"1\"+OR+grouping:\"2\"+OR+grouping:\"3\")+OR+solrtype:\"N\")&\nfq=((item_source:\"F\"+OR+item_source:\"B\"+OR+item_source:\"M\")+OR+solrtype:\"N\")&\nfq=\n{!tag%3Dgrouping}\n((grouping:\"1\"+OR+grouping:\"2\")+OR+solrtype:\"N\")&\nfq=\n{!tag%3Dlanguagecode}\n(languagecode:\"eng\"+OR+solrtype:\"N\")&\n\nDo the collation internals not handle\nFQs correctly?  The lookup/hit counts on filterCache seem to be\nincreasing just fine.  It will do N lookups, N hits, so I'm not\nthinking that caching is the problem. "
