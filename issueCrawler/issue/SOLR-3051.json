    "description": "I know this is pretty small potatoes, but I went to apply a patch to some 3.1 code, and ran \"ant eclipse\", but my project didn't import cleanly.  I had checked it out from the 3.1 branch in SVN.  I checked and the eclipse .project file is missing.  \n\nNot sure what the policy of updates to already released versions is when it's this minor?  I'm tossing a patch file out here for 3.1.     \n\nOne thought I had is can we \"version\" the project name in the eclipse file when we branch?   I typically have a couple of versions of Solr checked out, and I have to manually tweak them to have them all loaded in Eclipse.  If this sounds like something that we want to add to the build, I can attach a ticket.",
