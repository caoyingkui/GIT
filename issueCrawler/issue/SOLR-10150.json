    "description": "We noticed a considerable performance degradation (5x to 10x) using Solr 6.4 and huge increase of CPU utilization. Our use case is pretty simple: we have a single Solr Core with around 600K small size documents. We just do lookups by key (no full text searches) and use faceting capabilities.\n\nUsing the Solr Admin Thread Dump utilities we noticed a lot of threads using considerable cpuTime / userTime on codehale metrics (snapshot attached). The metrics part has been drastically changed in 6.4 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4735). Rolling back to Solr 6.3 has solved our performance problems.\n\nIs there any way to disable these metrics in version 6.4 ?\n\nThanks!",
