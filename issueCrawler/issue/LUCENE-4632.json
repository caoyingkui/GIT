    "description": "Currently we restring wrting to tests.tempDir after SOLR-4195, but it would be better to restrict more and only let child JVMs write to their working dir and not outside (and maybe corrumpt other JVMs).\n\nThe problem with current setup is that the child JVM's policy file does not know the runner number nor the absolute working directory (it must be absolute and platform-specific with backslash/slash/... -> new File(\".\").getAbsolutePath().\n\nDawid will release a new Junit4 package with a new sysprop passed to every child with its full CWD: junit4.childvm.cwd\n\nIn that case the policy file would use this property (and the clover.db.dir) to allow write access and allow only read/execute access for the rest of the  filesystem.",

I am running all tests, will commit this once it passes.\n\nThe tests are now completely sandboxed and cannot write outside their own temporary working directory (J0, J1,...). In addition, the test framework can write to its temp dir for communication files and clover database (if available).\n\nDawid: The new sysprop would not have been possible, the JVM sets ${user.dir} to the CWD on JVM startup: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html\n\nIn addition the new randomizedrunner framework prints the JVM pids on startup of each JVM.
