    "description": "PSDP persists the snapshots information in a Directory. When you open PSDP, it obtains a write lock on the snapshots dir (by keeping an open IndexWriter), and updates the directory when snapshots are created/released.\n\nThis causes problem in the following scenario \u2013 you have two processes, one updates the 'content' index and keeps PSDP open (because it also takes snapshots). Another process wants to read the existing snapshots information and open a read-only IndexReader on the 'content' index. The other process cannot read the existing snapshots information, because p1 keeps a write lock on the snapshots directory.\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\n\tHave PSDP open the IndexWriter over the directory for each snapshot/release. A bit expensive, and unnecessary.\n\tIntroduce a static readSnapshotsInfo on PSDP which accepts a Directory and returns the snapshots information. IMO it's cleaner, and won't have the performance overhead of opening/closing the IW as before.\n\n\n\nI'll post a patch (implementing the 2nd approach) shortly. I'd appreciate any comments.",
