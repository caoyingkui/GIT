    "description": "Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication\nwhen security is enabled.  It is possible to fake it by cleverly\nconstructing  a node name that does not exist and pointing to the\nattackers machine. This means, the system is only as secure as an\nunprotected Solr while the user believes it is secure.\n\n\nwho is affected?\n\nThis feature was introduced in SOLR-7849 (Solr 5.3). So, every release\nafter 5.3 is vulnerable if they use this feature. Systems using\nBasicAuth are affected and any custom authentication implementations\nusing this feature may also be vulnerable. However, Kerberos users are\nunaffected.\n\n\nWhat is the fix?\nThe fix includes checking if the node name is actually a member of the\nlive_nodes set.",
