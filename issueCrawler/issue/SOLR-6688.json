Therefore I should not get any error, not even a warning.\n\nI do not want to create the files because I do not need them. The error should simply not be there.",

If that is set, and a file is missing, it just returns a 200 with content of \"\".\n\nWith this tweak, the old admin UI could easily be extended to request admin-extra.html?ignoreMissingFiles=true, and thus errors go away.\n\nPossible?

I haven't yet seen any clear use-cases documented to give me any real idea of how it would be used.\n\nis there a specific issue tracking the inclusion of (or the decision to deprecate/remove) that feature in the angular UI?  if the new UI officially eliminates this feature then this issue can probably be resolved as \"Not a problem\" as of 6.0, but i'd rather not hijack/conflate a long standing bug report with longer discussion about the merits of (re-)implementing the feature the bug affects in the new UI.\n\n(searching around I see some hodge podge comments from various people answering your question in the context of broader issues/threads but no single specifically on topic place for folks to document usages/goals for \"admin-extra\" and/or alternative solutions) ",
