Seems like a sound justification to me.\n\nI also think I'm going to refactor all range field classes to remove Field from the class name. It seems more natural (to me) to have Point and Range counterparts (e.g., DoublePoint, DoubleRange, InetAddressPoint, InetAddressRange)? (and less typing is always a bonus) What do you think? (or does anyone care? - I know naming is often an exercise in bikeshedding)\n\nIf no one objects I can open a separate issue to \"Graduate Range Fields from sandbox\" that will refactor the range field class names and move them to the appropriate module? What does everyone think? ",

But vice-versa is also true \u2013 consistency being most important.  I care little wether both should have (or not have) a \"Field\" suffix.  There seems to be a lot of variation across Lucene, unfortunately.\n\nI can open a separate issue to \"Graduate Range Fields from sandbox\" that will refactor the range field class names and move them to the appropriate module?\n\n+1 ",
