    "description": "Inspired by Sahin Buyrukbilen's question here:\n\n  http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/b68846e383824653/how_to_export_lucene_index_to_a_simple_text_file#b68846e383824653\n\nI made a simple read/write codec that stores all postings data into a\nsingle text file (_X.pst), looking like this:\n\n\nfield contents\n  term file\n    doc 0\n      pos 5\n  term is\n    doc 0\n      pos 1\n  term second\n    doc 0\n      pos 3\n  term test\n    doc 0\n      pos 4\n  term the\n    doc 0\n      pos 2\n  term this\n    doc 0\n      pos 0\nEND\n\n\n\nThe codec is fully funtional \u2013 all Lucene & Solr tests pass with\n-Dtests.codec=SimpleText \u2013 but, its performance is obviously poor.\n\nHowever, it should be useful for debugging, transparency,\nunderstanding just what Lucene stores in its index, etc.  And it's a\nquick way to gain some understanding on how a codec works...",

I'd like to separately fix that and then hopefully put SImpleText in for rotation, so I'll leave this issue open for that. ",
