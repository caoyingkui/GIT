I think it should only take a Weight object and use the query returned by Weight.getQuery() to pass to the parent constructor? Otherwise +1. "

Added extra constructor\n\nprotected FilterWeight(Weight weight) {\n  super(weight.getQuery());\n  this.in = weight;\n}\n\n\nas you suggested. It seems though that the FilterWeight(Query query, Weight weight) constructor variant is still needed to cater for BlockJoinWeight and ToChildBlockJoinWeight usage? "
