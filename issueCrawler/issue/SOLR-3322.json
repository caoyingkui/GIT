    "description": "In some situations where a custom IndexReaderFactory is used the amount of information passed to the newReader(..) call is too small. E.g. if a factory needs to access some external data that depends on schema or even on the collection name then it has no way to obtain that context.\n\nWe cannot use SolrCoreAware here because this method is called before SolrCore is ready.\n\nI propose to simply change the signature and add a SolrCore argument. Even though SolrCore is not fully valid at this point, still the most useful properties there are valid (schema, descriptor, config, etc...).",
