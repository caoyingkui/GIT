If it seems to be\nascii, that could be put in parens.\nexample: 636f6f6c (cool)\n\nand incorporates Hoss' suggestion for printable Strings:\n\nif i were tasked with \ntrying to find a way to display in HTML an arbitrary byte[] that may or \nmay not be a String, i would start by attempting a String conversion, if \nthat succeds and all chars in the resulting String are \"printable\" ( \nie: Character.isDefined(c) && ! Character.isISOCOntrol(c)) then display \nthe first N chars (where N is some reasonable max size to display) ... if \nnot, then just display the first N characters of the hex string \nrepresenting the byte[].
