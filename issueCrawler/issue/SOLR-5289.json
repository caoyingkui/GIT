    "description": "Hello,\n\nSolr 4.4 added the ability to modify the schema by adding fields and specifying copy fields via the Schema REST API :\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaRESTAPI\n\nThis is great, since it no longer requires to put one's hands onto the Solr Server directly.\n\nOn the other hand, it's a bit frustrating that fields added that way can't be edited via the API too.\n\nhttp://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Update-field-properties-via-Schema-Rest-API-td4087907.html\n\nWill this possibility be implemented in the near future ?\n\nRegards,\nBen",
