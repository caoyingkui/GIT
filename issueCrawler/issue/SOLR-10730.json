    "description": "I have parent child relationship where parent's name is kept as a field in child document. Parent name at each level is unique. Given a path to the child I want to find out the leaf node. e.g., \nFields->id,Name,ParentName\nDocument1->id1,node1,\nDocument2->id2,node2,node1\nDocument3->id3,node3,node2\nDocument4->id4,node4,node2\n\nI have 2 requirements:\n1. I should be able to find Document3 from this path: \"node1\\node2\\node3\" without making multiple queries.\n\n2. if I do a traversal from Root to leaf, there should be a way where it returns me the path with respect to the root. So, the traversal output should be like this:\nid,Name,ParentName,TraversedPath\nid1,node1,,node1\nid2,node2,node1,node1\\node2\nid3,node3,node2,node1\\node2\\node3\nid4,node4,node2,node1\\node2\\node4",
