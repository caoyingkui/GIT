    "description": "While looking into SOLR-3734 i noticed that the LukeRequestHandler is blindly putting arrays of CopyField and SchemaField objects in the response, when returning copy from/to info, which are then getting written out using their toString.\n\nsteffkes seems to have done a great job of parsing the field name out of the SchemaField.toString, but the CopyField.toString info is useless \u2013 and clients shouldn't have to do special string parsing to pull out this info.\n\nI think we should just fix both of these arrays to just be the simple string values that they were most likely intended to be",
