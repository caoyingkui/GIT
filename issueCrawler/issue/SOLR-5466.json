At the moment the API does not let you get a list of current collections or view information about a specific collection.\n\nThe workaround is the use the Zookeeper API to get the list. This makes the Collections API harder to work with. \n\nAdding an action=LIST would significantly improve the function of this API.",

I think it should return collection properties as well as shard properties.\n\nFor example:\n\n/admin/collections?action=STATUS\n\n\nThe above returns a list of all collections in the cluster.\n\n/admin/collections?action=STATUS&collection=collection1\n\n\nThe above returns info only about collection1 and its shards (including their properties)\nor\n\n/admin/collections?action=STATUS&collection=collection1&shard=shard1,shard2,shard3...\n\n\nThe above call should return collection properties and shard properties for shard1,shard2 and shard3.\n\nI wish to remove the need to lookup against ZK directly for information that is inside cluster state.

So I think untangling all that is best put in another JIRA so we don't hold up this functionality for what is essentially cleanup.\n\nAbout the STATUS command. I see what you mean, it just feels overly complex. I'd just go for the STATUS returning the clusterstate. Here's why:\n1> whatever specifics we put in there are going to require that we maintain it. Take this example:\nSTATUS&fl=name,router,replicationFactor\n\nIf I have several collections, I now have to define a syntax for what I return to associate the replicationFactor  with Colleciton1, Collection2, etc. Would it be better just to give them the cluster state and let it go at that?\n\nI think my driving question is whether there's a need to do this that we're responding to or just doing it because we can.
