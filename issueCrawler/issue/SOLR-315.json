I tried to use SCV file and XML  format, when the doc amount is small, there is no problem, but with 2 million docs to add, it fails after hundreds of add operation(10 docs each add operation). If the commit operation is performed, situation get better, but there is still error code 500 response. The reason is string index out of bound, and if the error is ignored, there will be out of memory fail.",
