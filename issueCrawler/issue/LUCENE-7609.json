This change is breaking anyway, so maybe we should make things clean right away? For instance, I'm looking at the deprecated SimpleBindings.getValueSource which is not expected to be called by users of the expression module, so maybe we should remove it now? ",

I think we should either preserve this behaviour or document the new one? ",

            "content": "Updated patch:\n\n\tRemoves the queries/ValueSource dependency entirely - I had thought that we could keep this backwards-compatible, but there's a breaking change in the Bindings public signature, so we may as well go all in.\n\tRemoves the ValueSource.asDoubleValuesSource() helper method - will put this in separately with LUCENE-7610 as it's no longer tested by exercising the expressions\n\tChanges subsources to return 0 if they have no value.  I tried making this configurable but couldn't find a nice way of doing it - something for a later ticket maybe.\n\n ",
