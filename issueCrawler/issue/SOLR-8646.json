    "description": "Someone on IRC asked whether the HDFS support in Solr 4.10.3 happened to include a feature he was looking for.  I was not qualified to answer the specific question, but I figured I could look at CHANGES.txt to learn what version of Hadoop was included with that release, which would hopefully be enough information for them to figure out the answer.\n\nIt turns out that this information is not there.  I had to get the source code for the 4.10.3 tag and look in the ivy versions.\n\nI'd like to add the Hadoop version to CHANGES.txt in master and the stable branch, and discuss other major components to add to that list, such as HttpClient, another component I was surprised to not see.\n\nI'm not expecting to update CHANGES.txt for historical versions like 4.10.3, but eventually even the current versions will be ancient history.  With this change, if someone asks about 6.0 a few years from now, the problem I encountered won't happen again.\n\nDiscuss.",
