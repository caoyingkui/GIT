            "content": "The attached file implements this support.  Note that the score=\"distance\" local-param feature in the Solr 4 spatial field should also work too \u2013 pretty cool.\n\nI took a look at adding support for the \"geodist\" function, which is implemented in HaversineConstFunction.  Ugh, the logic therein is convoluted and it makes heavy assumptions about a \"MultiValueSource\" based field which the Solr 4 spatial fields don't use and never will.  Adding support here for Solr 4 spatial fields would definitely be a hack and on top of confusing code that I don't want to make any more confusing. So I'll pass on that.\n\nI plan to commit in a few days. "
