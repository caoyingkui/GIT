I've still got to make so that when you turn on a fault injection you can specify it's odds of hitting.\n\nI've also made it so that we can get away with not closing things in a valid test by have the ObjectReleaseTracker close unclosed objects at the end of the test if it's release check has been disabled on the test via annotation.
