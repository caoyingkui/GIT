I'd guess that other classes, like FuzzyQuery might have the same problem?\n\nThe advantage of such a char mapping is that we can keep the String API and\ndon't have to add special APIs to the Query objects for the queryparser.

            "content": "I think we should add a new constructor to WildcardQuery like this:\n\n\n  public WildcardQuery(Term term) {\n    this(term, WildcardTermEnum.WILDCARD_CHAR, WildcardTermEnum.WILDCARD_STRING);\n  }\n  \n  public WildcardQuery(Term term, char wildcardChar, char wildcardString) {\n    super(term);\n    this.wildcardChar = wildcardChar;\n    this.wildcardString = wildcardString;\n    \n    this.termContainsWildcard = (term.text().indexOf(wildcardChar) != -1) \n                                || (term.text().indexOf(wildcardString) != -1);\n  }\n\n\n\nThen the WildcardQuery doesn't need to know anything about escaping and the QueryParser\ncan just map wildcard characters that weren't escaped to some other unused chars and can\nunescape * and ? chars.\n\nThe only disadvantage of this design would be that the WildcardQuery.toString() would not\nproduce a String anymore that the QueryParser could parse. However, I think the requirement\nof Query.toString() to produce a parseable String is not very good anyways, because it adds\na dependency between the Query classes and the QueryParser. I'd prefer to add a method\nlike:\n\nString toQueryString(Query);\n\n\nto the QueryParser. Then Query.toString() wouldn't be tied anymore to a specific QueryParser\nimplementation and syntax.
