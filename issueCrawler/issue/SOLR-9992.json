It's kind of a lame assertion in this test.... it'd be more useful to highlight a grouped string.\n\nIt would be useful if the highlighters could highlight a numeric field. Consider the user experience where there are a bunch of fields to highlight, some of which happen to be numeric and the user's query is a number that matched one of those fields. ",
