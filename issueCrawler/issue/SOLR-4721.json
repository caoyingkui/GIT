    "description": "Seen this this Week on IRC, at least once. The UI was not completely loaded (only displayed the initial \"Loading ...\" forever) because /admin/cores doesn't respond with valid information.\n\ndon't remember of the actual error in this case, but we should handle this scenario better than we do right now.\n\nWe'll see what information we can get from the request and how we can display it. at least it should block the whole UI somehow that make it clear that something goes completely wrong - there is no way around, /admin/cores is the very first request we make to gather initial informations ..",
