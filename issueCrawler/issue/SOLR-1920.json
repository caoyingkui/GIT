It should be extended to allow any arbitrary data to be used as a placemarker for the next import.\n\nIt is possible to use externally supplied variables in data-config.xml and send values in via the URL that starts the import, but if the config can support it natively, that is better.",

New documents added to the database just get assigned the next autoincrement number.  If Solr could be informed that field X is the tracking field, the highest value encountered during an import (according to that field's sort mechanism) could be stored in dataimport.properties and re-used during the next delta-import.\n\nIf DIH is sufficiently disconnected from Solr schema internals (which actually seems likely), you'd have to base your sort on the SQL data type, because it would have no way to know what kind of field Solr has.\n\nI currently do all delta tracking outside of Solr, so I'm already covered.  The generic idea seemed worthy of opening an issue two years ago, because other people may run into situations where they cannot use a timestamp for delta tracking.\n\nI have no idea what kind of tracking problems you'd encounter when dealing with soft commits.  Without a transaction log, that could get ugly. For performance reasons, I am initially deploying 4.x with no transaction log (see SOLR-3954). "

This would mean you'd have to sort your documents by the autoincrement field so that the highest one is guaranteed to be last.\n\nAnother possibility is to have it go out and execute a query to get the values from the database in a special \"get the properties\" query.  This would be like SOLR-3365, where the user wants to get \"last_index_time\" from the database rather than from the Solr server's clock as currently done.  To implement SOLR-3365, I imagine letting the user specify a query like \"select CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as 'last_index_time' from dual\" .  It would be just as easy to let any set of properties be put in such a query, for instance, \"select max(autoincrement_field) from mytable\".  So maybe something can be written that would solve both issues? "
