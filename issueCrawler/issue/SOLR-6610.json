            "content": "The way the ZkController.publishAndWaitForDownStates is written, it checks if the live_nodes exist and then it tries to publish and wait but that's not really correct. It should check if live_nodes exists and it has at least one childred. Then only we can be sure that there will be an overseer to process the state requests.\n\nI've seen this problem on cluster restarts where ZK already has /live_nodes existing but without any children (which are ephemeral of course). But I've never seen this problem on individual node restarts when an overseer exists in the cluster already. ",

            "content": "Shalin, I think you're right. I misread the code in that publishAndWaitForDownStates's call to clusterState.getCollection(collectionName) doesn't actually require a watch since it'll call out to zookeeper on-demand. This also explains why most of our complaints come for 1 node dev clusters. ",
