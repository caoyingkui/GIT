    "description": "In SOLR-11380, SolrJ added a RequestWriter.ContentWriter abstraction to improve SolrJ's ability to stream data with less buffering.  This basically obsoletes ContentStream in SolrJ.  We have both for back-compat but we need to mark ContentStream deprecated in SolrJ if we are to be rid of it in 8.0.  \n\nIn another issue for 8.0 we can move ContentStream to solr-core where it's used to consume data from the client, and then remove the deprecated stuff.",
