            "content": "My understanding of what `LeaderElector.setup()` does is that it just creates the `/overseer_elect/election` \"directory\" in ZK.  This isn't ephemeral, so in reality should only be a one-off job?  Unless ZK has been wiped whilst the node was disconnected from ZK, that directory should still be there.  It shouldn't hurt to add in the call to setup in reconnect, but I don't believe it is necessary.\n\ncancelElection() removes the `leaderSeqPath` which is the ephemeral node(s) under that \"directory\", e.g. \"19127283862405127-xxxxxxx:yyyyy_solr-n_0000000368\" in my case.
