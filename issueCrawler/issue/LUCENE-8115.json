            "content": "sorry \u2013 i think i answered my own question by re-reading the regex in the patch a few more times and thinking it through...\n\nIIUC this issue is not about defining any use of @inheritDoc as unneccessary, it's about identifying and preventing the specific situation of @inheritDoc usage that is fundementally unneccessary because there is no other content in the javadoc.\n\nIe:  /** {@inheritDoc} */ is an \"unneccessary\" use of the tag, because we get the same effect by eliminating the javadoc completley.  Meanwhile something like /** Just like our parent but better {@inheritDoc} */ would still be allowed.\n\ndo i have that correct? ",

Attached patch clarifies the message associated with the check to \"{@inheritDoc} on its own is unnecessary\".\n\nI feel like i'm missing some context/background info here ...\n\nThe context here is that an automatic style check and enforcement like this seemed to me to be a logical follow-on from David Smiley's comment on SOLR-11801 i.e. if tools can pick up on things like this then human code reviewers can focus more on other things and/or code readers are not distracted by the unnecessary @inheritDoc clutter and/or code writers are encouraged to add supplemental information alongside the @inheritDoc.
