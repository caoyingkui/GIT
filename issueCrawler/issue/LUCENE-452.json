    "description": "The PrefixQuery is inheriting the java.lang.Object's object default equals method. This makes it hard to have test working of PrefixFilter or any other task requiring equals to work proerply (insertion in Set, etc.). The equal method should be very similar, not to say identical except for class casting, to the equals() of TermQuery.",

Your use of the boost factor was nice to see, but points out that we have ignored it in other .equals methods (e.g. WildcardQuery).  If you're interested, we'd accept patches to correct all of the other .equals methods to incorporate the boost factor  ",

I'm happy to see this promptly resolved, but I wouldn't like to take credit that isn't mine  ",
