I doubt we'll fix this on 5.x, but it might be worth backporting to 6.x just in case there's another security release there. ",

It's done with a basic start of sorlcloud example on my local machine (as described here https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/getting-started-with-solrcloud.html ) trying to reload \"gettingstarted\" collection.\n\nI confirm that the host/port/context is missing in the 5.5.0 version, we'll probably update to v7 soon \n\nThanks again for your help on IRC\n\nRegards ",
