    "description": "I've noticed that SolrDocumentsList uses long for fields like numFound and start.  But the methods SolrQuery.setRows and setStart only accept ints, which leads to the possibility of a query being unable to request some of the documents found by a query.  I realize that this is an edge case, since not many Lucene indexes will have 2 billion+ documents?  But it is an inconsistency and requires that I at some point reduce a long to an int in code, which always feels wrong.",
