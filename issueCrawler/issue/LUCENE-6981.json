    "description": "Currently, SpanQuery has two protected static helper methods for extracting all TermContext objects from a collection of SpanWeights.  These are useful for objects extending SpanQuery.  However, because they're static protected, they can't be accessed by subclasses if those subclasses have been loaded by a different classloader (for example, if they're being loaded as a Solr plugin).",
