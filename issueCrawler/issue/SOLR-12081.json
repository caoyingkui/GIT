            "content": "Can someone please review... maybe Cassandra Targett since it's the ref guide?  I wasn't sure when I needed to escape chars or not; I've observed that the Markdown plugin to IntelliJ doesn't quite follow the nitty gritty details consistently.  I tried to build the PDF but ran afowl of errors recently reported in SOLR-10297.  I tried to do the HTML version by attempting to see if I could use a Docker Jekyll image but ran into errors and I'm not sure what the cause is.  I could of course try to install that stuff \"normally\" but I'm keen on Docker and apparently I want to make my life more difficult than needed today. ",

I also changed the layout of the uf params section - it seemed a big block of text, so I made all the new example goodness into a bulleted list. I attached a new patch that includes your changes + these little additions of mine.\n\nOtherwise, +1 commit when you're ready. Thanks for working on this.\n ",

I found an additional thing that needed escaping and did it.  Using https://asciidoclive.com/ was very useful to just take a particular paragraph/section of interest to work on and feel like the results were accurate.  I checked the PDF too.  Unfortunately I can't rely on the IntelliJ plugin completely.\n\nBTW I didn't add a CHANGES.txt entry for this issue... IMO it'd be too much noise & extra process on top of what we already have for something small-ish especially. ",
