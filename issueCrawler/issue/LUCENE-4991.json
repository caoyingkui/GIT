            "content": "Here's a patch. I broke out the current logic into two cases (more code, but simpler).\n\nAlso added a lot of tests (most of the tests i added actually pass today, its to ensure we aren't breaking other things).\n\nI fixed classic QP only because its not obvious to me how to fix the flexible QP. Ideally in the future we'd factor these tests back into QueryParserTestBase ",
