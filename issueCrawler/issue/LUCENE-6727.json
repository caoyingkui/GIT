    "description": "(discussion split off from LUCENE-6720)\nValueSourceScorer is an abstract scorer based on a ValueSource; notably it's returned by FunctionValues.getRangeScorer.  None of the implementations consider FunctionValues.exist(doc).  It really ought to.  DocValuesRangeQuery does.\n\nPerhaps this should be based on the ValueFillter/MutableValue API.  It optimizes existence & value fetching in one fetch when possible.  Furthermore, it might be possible to have a common range query check without doing it per-type?",
