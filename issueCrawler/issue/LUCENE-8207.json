Thank you for your time.\n\nIn my opinion it can be useful at search time if you do not want to indexed your data in lowercase, it's really painful to write a case-insensitive regexp : [a|A][b|B][d|D]09[c|C][d|D] versus (?i)(abd09cd). \n\nFor example, in a security case to prevent cybersquatting or typosquatting, you do not want to index you data in lowercase but half of your searches are case-insensitive regexp.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis could be discussed  ",
