If it doesn't apply to your build, let me know and I'll create a patch for the version you're working with.\n\nThe problem was that the scorer needed to be set on the delegate collecter after each segment reader was set. The initial code was setting the scorer on the delegate collector only once, which worked fine for single sort critera. \n\nJoel\n "

Could be a race condition here where a background merge gets done in between commits, causing there to be fewer then 5 segments.\n\nI was thinking about just taking out this assertion and using the rest of the test. All we need is there to be more then 1 segment to ensure the test is valid.\n\nLet me know what you think,\n\nThanks,\nJoel "
