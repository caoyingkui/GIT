    "description": "I found a case where the computed plan did not resolve all violations even though it was possible.\n\nThe use-case is as follows:\n\n\tCluster has 2 nodes\n\tCollection has 2 shards, 2 replicas, created with maxShardsPerNode=2 so each node has exactly two cores\n\tAdd a cluster policy 'cores': '<2', 'node' : '#ANY'. At this point there are exactly two violations (as returned by diagnostics API)\n\tUse a trigger to call compute plan action (I used the metric trigger)\n\tThe plan computed has only 1 move replica operation, there by leaving 1 violation behind\n\n\n\nWith two move replica operations, all violations could have been corrected but for some reason that was not suggested.",
