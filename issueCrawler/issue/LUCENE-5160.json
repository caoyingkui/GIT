    "description": "Around line 190 of NIOFSDirectory, the loop to read in bytes doesn't properly handle the -1 condition that can be returned from FileChannel.read().  If it returns -1, then it will move the file pointer back and you will enter an infinite loop.  SimpleFSDirectory displays the same characteristics, although I have only seen the issue on NIOFSDirectory.\n\nThe code in question from NIOFSDirectory:\n\ntry {\n        while (readLength > 0) {\n          final int limit;\n          if (readLength > chunkSize) {\n            // LUCENE-1566 - work around JVM Bug by breaking\n            // very large reads into chunks\n            limit = readOffset + chunkSize;\n          } else {\n            limit = readOffset + readLength;\n          }\n          bb.limit(limit);\n          int i = channel.read(bb, pos);\n          pos += i;\n          readOffset += i;\n          readLength -= i;\n        }",
