Unfortunately, for even small changes within the ANTLR grammar, a large number of differences will be created for the ANTLR generated lexer/parser code.  With the assumption that ANTLR has correctly generated the lexer/parser code from the grammar, it should be fine.  The unit tests seem to have pretty good coverage, so I think it should be good to go  .\n\n--Jack ",
