            "content": "False alarm.\n\nIt seems that calling DataImporter#loadDataConfig does not initialize the sub-entity's fields. In particular the Context#getAllEntityFields returned empty and therefore the xpath for the child entity never got created. All tests should use DataImporter#loadAndInit (which creates DataConfig as well as initializes the entity nodes) instead of DataImporter#loadDataConfig. If we change loadDataConfig to loadAndInit in the test case, it passes.\n\nI'll take a look at the other places where loadDataConfig is being used. "
