But if the nested document ID conforms to the aforementioned pattern (root ID, exclamation, nested ID), then I think we could at least enforce uniqueness within the nested document structure.  I'm not sure if it's additionally worth the expense in checking IDs globally (i.e. in the index).\nRegardless, this ought to be documented, and ideally with a new documentation page dedicated to nested documents.
