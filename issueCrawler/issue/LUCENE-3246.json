This would save disk space if a segments has more deletetions than live docs. Not sure if this can easily be implemented and is worth the complexity (that we already have because of both versions)?\n\nThe patch looks fine! ",

Ie, handle both sparse set and sparse unset compactly?  Though it should be unusual that you have so many deletes against a segment (esp. because TMP now targets such segs more aggressively).\n\nWe should do this under a new issue (the old code also didn't handle the \"many deletions\" case sparsely either, just the \"few deletions\" case).
