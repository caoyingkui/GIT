    "description": "Hi I need to get action wise count in a campaign. Using facet.pivot=campaignId,action to get it.\n\nEx : campaignId,id,action\n       1,1,a\n       1,1,a\n       1,2,a\n       1,2,b\n\nWhen I do  facet.pivot I get \n{a:3,b:1}\n, Facet considers duplicate rows in count.\n\nI need distinct by combination of campaignId,id,action which is \n{a:2,b:1}\n\nThanks,",
