    "description": "In LUCENE-4647 I added a TODO to handle resubility to this class. Currently it allocates two new TokenStreams for every document, as well as some BytesRefs and an IntsRef. I think it should be possible to reuses those across documents (and also the Field instances, while we're at it).\n\nIt will make the class not thread-safe, but I don't think that's an important feature. CategoryDocumentBuilder (its predecessor) wasn't thread-safe either, and Field isn't thread safe, so it's fine by me if FacetFields isn't thread safe too.",
