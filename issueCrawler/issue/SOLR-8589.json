The current results are contained in a \"collections\" node, we can simply add an \"aliases\" node if there are any aliases defined.",

A couple questions based on your feedback -\n\nThere are a few string constants that could be moved to CollectionAdminParams\nIf we do this, do you think there is going to be confusion between when to use CollectionAdminParams.COLLECTION and CollectionAdminParams.COLLECTIONS? That's the only potential downside that I can see.\n\nAlso, I think we should return aliases by default.\nI don't know if there is anybody out there that has some kind of monitoring script set up to parse the result of LIST, and in general I try to be super conservative about changing APIs. Maybe we default to returning them in 7.0, and not returning them in 6.x? That sounds like a fair compromise to me.\n\nThis patch should also update related LIST tests in CollectionsAPISolrJTest.\nSure. I'm wary of scope creep, but it also makes sense to expand CollectionAdminRequest.List capabilities to allow toggling for collection and aliases as well.\n\nAlso it should update JavaDoc comments where they say that the LIST command lists collections to include that it also lists aliases...\nI think I got all of these, let me know if I missed some.

That's the only potential downside that I can see.\n\nThinking about it, perhaps it is better to skip this detailed control of what to list. Keep things simple. We add a section to the LIST XML response. It is generally useful, it is not huge in size, and no real benefit to be able to turn it on or off imo.\n\n\nAlso, I think we should return aliases by default.\nI don't know if there is anybody out there that has some kind of monitoring script set up to parse the result of LIST, and in general I try to be super conservative about changing APIs. Maybe we default to returning them in 7.0, and not returning them in 6.x? That sounds like a fair compromise to me.\n\nThis is XML, and we add a new XML node, not changing anything of the existing. Any XML parser used to retrieve the <arr name=\"collections\"> would still work exactly as before. So even if someones script breaks, that will still not be a bug on our parts, this is not a back-compat break.\n\nI can take a stab at simplifying the patch  ",
