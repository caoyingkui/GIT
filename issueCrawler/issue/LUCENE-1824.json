    "description": "FastVectorHighlighter does not take word boundaries into consideration when building fragments, so that in most cases the first and last word of a fragment are truncated.  This makes the highlights less legible than they should be.  I will attach a patch to BaseFragmentBuilder that resolves this by expanding the start and end boundaries of the fragment to the first whitespace character on either side of the fragment, or the beginning or end of the source text, whichever comes first.  This significantly improves legibility, at the cost of returning a slightly larger number of characters than specified for the fragment size.",

I designed FragmentsBuilder can be pluggable, so that any other FragmentsBuilders can be written/contributed, e.g. WhitespaceFragmentsBuilder, SentenceAwareFragmentsBuilder, etc. I think adding new FragmentsBuilders (plus test cases) is better than modifying existing FragmentsBuilders. Don't forget that some languages (CJK) don't use period or whitespace for boundaries of words/sentences when you write new FragmentsBuilders. ",

The updated patch now contains just these two new classes and no modifications to other code.\n\nI don't want to hold up the release of 2.9, but anyone attempting to use the SimpleFragmentsBuilder with latin languages, or others that use whitespace to delimit words, will be dismayed by the rampant truncation!

As a result, all FragmentsBuilder is now boundary-aware natively, as long as using an appropriate BoundaryScanner.\n\nI've not touched test yet. Because this patch changes fragments boundaries, the existing test should go fail! ",
