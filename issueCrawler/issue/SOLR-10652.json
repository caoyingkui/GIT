    "description": "It'd be nice if `new Builder(\"http://localhost:8983/solr\").build()` would work without specification of `queueSize` (triggers\n\n\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException\n\tat java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue.<init>(LinkedBlockingQueue.java:261)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.<init>(ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.java:145)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient$Builder.build(ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.java:694)\n\n\n\nand other values since those are mostly for fine tuning that there's no need to let the user run into the `IllegalArgumentException`. If `queueSize` and other options provided by `Builder` need to be set in all cases, this should be documented in `Builder.build` and `Builder.with[property]` and illegal values be caught before `java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue.<init>(LinkedBlockingQueue.java:261)` because that's more verbose and intuitive.",

            "content": "We should indeed have a default value for the queueSize.  Who's going to paint that bikeshed?  Perhaps the default should be a value that's pretty low, with javadoc recommendations to actually set it.\n\nI think the reason that a default does not exist is that there has never been a default value before.  All of the old constructors included a queueSize parameter, so it was always mandatory.\n\nAnother problem I noticed, not really related to this issue:  All constructors are deprecated.  The Builder#build() method is using one of those constructors.  IMHO, this should be using an alternate constructor with protected visibility, not one that's public and deprecated.  HttpSolrClient has such a constructor. ",
