I wanted to make it impossible to forget to apply this optimization so the way the patch works is that IndexSearcher.getSimilarity now takes a boolean needsScores parameter too and returns a dummy similarity when scores are not needed. This forces all queries that need to work with a Similarity to propagate needsScores to index searcher to make sure we do not load eg. norms when scores are not needed. "
