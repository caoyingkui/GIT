    "description": "If you do \"ant clean\" on the root level of Lucene and then go to e.g. contrib/queryparser (3.x only) or contrib/misc (3.x and trunk) and call \"ant test\", the build of tests fails:\n\n\tcontrib/queryparser's ExtendedableQPTests extend a core TestQueryParser (3.x only, in module this works, of course)\n\tcontrib/misc/TestIndexSplitter uses a core class to build its index\n\n\n\nTo find the root cause: We should first remove the core tests from contrib classpath, so the issue gets visible even without \"ant clean\" before. Then we can fix this.",
