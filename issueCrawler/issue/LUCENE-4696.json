    "description": "Currently SpanNearQuery can only take other SpanQuery objects, which include spans, span term and span wrapped multi-term queries, but not Boolean queries.\n\nBy allowing a Boolean query to added to a SpanNearQuery, we can add f.i. queries\nthat come from a QueryParser and which can not be easily transformed in the corresponding span objects.\n\nThe main use case here is to find the intersection between two sets of results with the additional restriction that the matched terms from the different queries should be near one another.",
