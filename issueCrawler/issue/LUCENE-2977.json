            "content": "Patch for auto-detecting output compression mode of result line file:\n\n\n\tgetInputStream() moved from ContentSource to a new class StreamUtils under util. It is now named inputStream(File).\n\toutputStream() method added to StreamUtils.\n\n\n\nBefore applying this patch svn mv modules/benchmark/src/test/org/apache/lucene/benchmark/byTask/feeds/ContentSourceTest.java modules/benchmark/src/test/org/apache/lucene/benchmark/byTask/utils/StreamUtilsTest.java\n\nI kept for now the \"force-bzip\" logic in WriteLineDocTask but I would like to remove it - it is strange, and in any case LineDocSource would only auto-detect bzip input format if WriteLineDocTask was able to auto-detect bzip output format. Removing it will also simplify StreamUtils. Any opinions on removing this \"force-bzip\" option? ",

I think that it's reasonable to request the user to specify an output file with .bz2 extension if he wants bzip compression. I don't see how it will simplify StreamUtils though, but I trust you  (perhaps you meant it will simplify WLDT?) ",
