Some of them even acquire locks\non the writer instance or assert that the current thread doesn't hold a lock.\n    This makes it very difficult to have a manageable threading model.\n\n    This change separates out the IndexWriter from those classes and makes them all\n    independent of IW. IW now implements a new interface for DocumentsWriter to communicate\n    on failed or successful flushes and tragic events. This allows IW to make it's critical\n    methods private and execute all lock critical actions on it's private queue that ensures\n    that the IW lock is not held. Follow-up changes will try to detach more code like\n    publishing flushed segments to ensure we never call back into IW in an uncontrolled way.",
