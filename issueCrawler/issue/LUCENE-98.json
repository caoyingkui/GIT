    "description": "Moved from todo.xml:\nAdd lastModified() method to Directory, FSDirectory and RamDirectory, so it \ncould be cached in IndexWriter/Searcher manager.\n\nI'm not sure what is being asked for here. IndexReader implements:\n\n  /** Returns the time the index in this directory was last modified. */\n  public static long lastModified(Directory directory) throws IOException \n{\n    return directory.fileModified(\"segments\");\n  }\n\nThis appears to just be asking to have Directory implement:\n\n  /** Returns the time this directory was last modified. */\n  public abstract long lastModified() throws IOException;\n\nAnd FSDirectory something like:\n\n  /** Returns the time this directory was last modified. */\n  public long lastModified() throws IOException \n{\n    return fileModified(\"segments\");\n  }\n\nand something similar in RAMDirectory (although that one would be a little \ndifferent since its fileModified implementation returns the current time).\n\nIs there more to this that I'm missing?",
