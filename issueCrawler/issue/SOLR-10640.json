    "description": "CheckLinksAndAnchors was written to address the problem of \"valid\" asciidoc files/links that would only work when generating individual html files that linked to eachother, but not when generating an uber-pdf where all the pages are included together.  notably: it ensures that: a) links to toher \"pages\" include a fragment pointing at an 'id'; b) no 'id' is declared more then once (in multiple pages)\n\nwe can and should also generalize this to check that:\n\n\tall the links to other pages point at real page names\n\tall the links to other pages refer to '#frag-ids' that actaully exist in that page.",
