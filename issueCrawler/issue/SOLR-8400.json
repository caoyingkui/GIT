    "description": "Now that SOLR-8378 adds upconfig and downconfig to bin/solr, the next logical thing is to allow people to reload the collection after a config upload.\n\nOther useful collection commands to have available from command line could be list, linkconfig and migratestateformat. Adding this many will clutter the tool usage - perhaps we should have had a collection namespace as well as the new zk one? Imagine the following shell command sequence:\n\nfor coll in $(bin/solr collection list) ; do\n  bin/solr collection migratestateformat -c $coll\ndone\nbin/solr zk upconfig -d my/dir -n mynewconf\nbin/solr collection linkconfig -n mynewconf -c mycoll\nbin/solr collection reload -c mycoll",
