    "description": "This is kind of an esoteric usage and several things have to be true for the issue to surface. We discovered it using Hue generated queries.\n\nIf you 1) specify a global facet.limit, 2) specify a facet.field.limit in local params, 3) on a distributed search, then the field limit will be ignored.\n\nSome examples:\nfacet.limit=2&facet.field={!key=other f.cat.facet.limit=15}cat \u2013 works for single shard, but not multiple shards.\nfacet.limit=2&facet.field=cat&f.cat.facet.limit=15 \u2013 works in all cases\n\nThis could be treated as a docs bug to explicitly say that while some facet settings in local params work, they should not be relied upon, or we could treat this as a parser bug and make distributed search work like non-distrib.",
