Lucene 2.9 is Java 1.4, so it must compile, if you run it with this JDK version.\n\nWithout this, it's impossible to check the dependency correctly, and because of this I fixed this. I dont want to commit this in 3.x or trunk! So please just tell, if you are fine with fixing it in Lucebe 2.9, so it works as expected!\n\nThis patch can be ported to 3.x or trunk, when 1.6 contribs will appear.\n\nThis patch is for Lucene 2.9 branch only!

If you only want to compile Java 1.4 compatible contribs, add '-Dforce.jdk14.build=true' to command line.\n\nTotal time: 0 seconds\n\n\n\nFor testing a whole \"ant test\" with JDK 1.4 you can pass the mentioned property, so it excludes als Java 1.5 contribs. With this its possible for me as release manager of 2.9, to test compatibility with Java 1.4.\n\nRobert, are you fine with that for 2.9.3? If we need something similar in trunk, we may think about adding a similar ant magic to the trunk/3x build scripts. But this is not part of this issue, this is fix for 2.9.3 only. ",

I agree the default should be brittle (hard error).\n\nCan we use this for Solr/Lucene on trunk/3x?  Ie Solr requires JDK >= 1.6, but Lucene is >= 1.5; we don't want 1.6 features to accidentally sneak into Lucene... ",

I already verified that the whole build and test suite (with the ignore 1.5 contribs option) succeed with JDK 1.4.2_19. This is good to know as the release manager.\n\nCan we use this for Solr/Lucene on trunk/3x?
