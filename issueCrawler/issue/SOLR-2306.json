    "description": "Solr JMX support is great for reading the state of the search engine but it should also support writing parameters that can affect the runtime performance of the engine. At Zvents, our team wrote a custom web-UI in the /admin folder to accomplish this but now have made a preliminary patch to move this into JMX so that JConsole can be used to modify runtime parameters. This is mostly used to tune ranking parameters in the configuration file without passing them via the URL (to prevent changes to our front end site) nor restarting the servlet container.",
