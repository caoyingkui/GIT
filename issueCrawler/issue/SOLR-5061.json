(Mark Miller)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCT: There is a page on solr.xml: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Core+Admin+and+Configuring+solr.xml. This should be updated to show the new format and still include information on the old format for anyone with the old format who uses this guide for reference.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSOLR-4655: Add option to have Overseer assign generic node names so that new addresses can host shards without naming confusion. (Mark Miller, Anshum Gupta)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCT: I think this only needs to be added to any new content for solr.xml at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Core+Admin+and+Configuring+solr.xml\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that cassandra posted some additional deailed suggests in a comment on the existing page in the ref guide...\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Core+Admin+and+Configuring+solr.xml?focusedCommentId=33296160#comment-33296160",

The order I'd suggest is the order I discussed them in my initial proposal - up to you, but it's ideal to have them flow together on screen and in the PDF:\n\na. Format of solr.xml\nb. Legacy solr.xml Configuration\nc. Moving to the New solr.xml Format\nd. CoreAdminHandler Parameters and Usage\n\n(To re-order pages, go to Browse then Pages (up by your name at top). Then choose Tree. You'll see a hierarchical list of pages and can move re-order them there.) "
