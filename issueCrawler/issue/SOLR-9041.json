If you think otherwise, maybe we should document a workaround (as to how an admin can restrict core admin commands) and point 5x users to the workaround? However, I do understand that fixing at 6.1 and backporting to 5x would leave 6.0 without the fix, which is a tricky situation. I'll leave to your judgement, or Anshum Gupta's suggestions. ",
