    "description": "NumberRangePrefixTree must normalize/optimize in toRangeShape() to a LeveledValue (not a range) when possible because of assumptions made elsewhere.  Plus it should be faster.  The case of April to April 1st should yield April 1st, and likewise April 30th to April should yield April 30th.  These cases weren't handled leading to a CI test failure (credit to randomized testing).",
