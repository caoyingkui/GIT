    "description": "Some tests catch Exceptions in separate threads and just print a stack trace - the test does not fail. The test should fail. Since LUCENE-2274, the LuceneTestCase(J4) class installs an UncaughtExceptionHandler, so this type of catching and solely printing a Stack trace is a bad idea. Problem is, that the run() method of threads is not allowed to throw checked Exceptions.\n\nTwo possibilities:\n\n\tCatch checked Exceptions in the run() method and wrap into RuntimeException or call Assert.fail() instead\n\tUse Executors",
