    "description": "Currently we always pick the first shard present locally for a request against a collection preferring the leader.\n\nSince we are doing this locally it doesn't even matter which replica we pick. Picking a leader will be slightly more efficient for updates.\n\nWe should refactor HttpSolrCall#getCoreByCollection to check for leaders of all shards before picking any other replica. Right now we just do it for the first shard.",
