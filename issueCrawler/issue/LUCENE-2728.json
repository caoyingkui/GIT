    "description": "The EnwikiContentSource does not properly identify the id (name in benchmark parlance) of the documents.  It currently produces assigns the id on the last <id> tag it sees in the document, as opposed to the id of the document.  Most documents have multiple <id> tags in them.  This prevents the ContentSource from being used effectively in producing documents for updating.\n\nExample doc:\n\n<page>\n    <title>AlgeriA</title>\n    <id>5</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>133452200</id>\n      <timestamp>2007-05-25T17:11:48Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Gurch</username>\n        <id>241822</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor />\n      <comment>[[WP:AES|\u00e2<86><90>]]Redirected page to [[Algeria]]</comment>\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">#REDIRECT [[Algeria]] R from CamelCase</text>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n\nIn this case, the getName() return 241822 instead of 5.  page/id is unique according to the schema at  http://www.mediawiki.org/xml/export-0.3.xsd, so we should just get that one.",
