    "description": "Our version of Saxon-HE has a corrupt manifest file - this has posed problems before but we worked around it somehow. Since trunk has moved to Java 8, this has come up again for me as I can no longer run tests in eclipse because it complains about the corrupt manifest. This has since been fixed, so we should update.",
