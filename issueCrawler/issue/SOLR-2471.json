(either the example schema/data or one provided in an attachment). \n\nat a general level, i'm not really sure i understand what you would expect \"qt\" to do when used in localparams.  qt selects the request handler used, but when local params are parsed the handler is has already been choosen (there is only one handler per request) ... i'm fairly certain that the qt local patrams in your second example isn't doing anything \u2013 but you said it works for you, hence my confusion about what your goal is.
