    "description": "While trying to solve a problem, I came up with something that didn't work for what I was trying to do, but seemed like it might be useful for somebody.  This allows somebody to decide during the course of a mutateValue method that they'd rather skip the mutate entirely - leave the source field value completely unchanged.",
