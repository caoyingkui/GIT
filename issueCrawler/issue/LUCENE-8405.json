    "description": "I would like to propose removing TopDocs.maxScore. The reasoning is that either you are sorting by score and then its value is easy to access via the score of the best hit. Or you sort by one or more fields and computing it is wasteful:\n\n\tterm frequencies and norms need to be read and decoded for every match\n\tscores need to be computed on every match\n\tearly-termination optimizations are disabled\n\n\n\nIt would be more efficient to collect hits twice: once with scores disabled to get the top hits, and once to get the best score which would run efficiently thanks to impacts and MAXSCORE, especially with a size of 1:\n\nTopDocs topHits = searcher.search(query, 1);\nfloat maxScore = topHits.scoreDocs.length == 0 ? Float.NaN : topHits.scoreDocs[0].score;\n\n\nThe doDocScores option of TopFieldCollector has drawbacks as well but at least doesn't disable early-termination optimizations and doesn't require scores to be computed on every hit.\n\nAs this would be a significant breaking change, I'm targeting 8.0.",

            "content": "Here is a patch. I tried to avoid adding a breaking change to Solr with this Lucene change, so Solr still returns the maximum score in its responses, which is implemented via a new \"MaxScoreCollector\" wrapped in a MultiCollector with the top hits collector. That said I think Solr should probably remove the ability to get the maximum score when sorting by a field for the reasons mentioned above. ",
