    "description": "After upgrading to solr 3.3.0 from 1.4.0, I noticed that I couldn't get the MoreLikeThisHandler to return debugging data. I tried the debug parameters  debugQuery and debug, but all I got was:\n <bool name=\"debug\">true</bool>\n\nI took a look at the code for the MoreLikeThisHandler, and noted in the debbuging part that the handler is adding the variable dbg to the response (line 211):\n rsp.add(\"debug\", dbg);\n\nSuch variable is created at line 197:\nboolean dbg = req.getParams().getBool(CommonParams.DEBUG_QUERY, false);\n\nI suppose the correct variable to add to the response would be dbgInfo:\nNamedList<Object> dbgInfo = SolrPluginUtils.doStandardDebug(req, q, mlt.getRawMLTQuery(), mltDocs.docList);\n        if (null != dbgInfo) {\n          if (null != filters) {\n            dbgInfo.add(\"filter_queries\",req.getParams().getParams(CommonParams.FQ));\n            List<String> fqs = new ArrayList<String>(filters.size());\n            for (Query fq : filters) \nUnknown macro: {              fqs.add(QueryParsing.toString(fq, req.getSchema()));            } \n            dbgInfo.add(\"parsed_filter_queries\",fqs);\n          }\n\nSummarizing, i believe line 211 should be changed to:\n\nrsp.add(\"debug\", dbgInfo);",
