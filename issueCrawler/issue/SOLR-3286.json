Each document has only 10 or less of the dynamic fields populated, but there is a large set of dynamic fields across all docs.\n\nEventually Solr will fall over due to OOM errors, because the fieldCache is enormous. Adding more heap does not help. Adjusting the  documented cache size configs does not help.",
