    "description": "Clicking on the \"Download\" button at the top of every Solr website page takes you to http://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html (let's call it the download-redirect page), which pauses for 3 seconds and then auto-redirects to the Apache download mirror page for the latest Solr release.  The download-redirect page has info about downloading past releases, but there are problems with the current setup:\n\n\n\tThe 3 second auto-redirect doesn't allow enough time to read the page before it's gone.\n\tFirefox (latest version, on OS X and Windows) doesn't include the page in its browser history, so you can't go back - clicking the back button will take you to the page you were on when you clicked the \"Download\" button, not back to the download-redirect page.\n\tInternet Explorer and Chrome include the download-redirect page in their history, so clicking the back button will go there, but then after three seconds you get redirected to the Apache download mirrors page, whack-a-mole style.\n\n\n\nWhen I was putting the download-redirect page together, I guess I only tested on Safari on OS X 10.10.  This browser keeps the download-redirect page in its history, so clicking the back button after the auto-redirect takes you to the mirror pages will take you back to the download-redirect page, and the auto-redirect never recurs.",

I think the current setup is problematic, as you said, because the redirect page isn't visible long enough for a newcomer to find the link for older releases.\n\nIt took me a minute to find the \"Download Older Releases\" link at the bottom of the page, because it is in a different place than the \"Download\" link.  I'm not sure if it's a bad idea or a good idea to move it so it's right below Download. ",

The page also talks about the importance of validating the download and provides a link to the archive too.\n\nWe should also merge in the info from\u00a0http://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#about-versions\u00a0into the downloads page.\n\nTo avoid having to commit changes to the downloads page for every release, it should be possible to generate the version specific text and links dynamically with JS. I imagine the JS code pulling in https://projects.apache.org/json/projects/lucene-solr.json\u00a0and from there parse what is the latest version as well as the latest bugfix version for previous major version, and generate all the links.\u00a0With this in place we (still) don't need to commit updates to this page.\n\nAs a bonus we can also show\u00a0the release date and generate links to release notes.\u00a0 ",
