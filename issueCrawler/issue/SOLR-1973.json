    "description": "I seem to be running into an issue with Solr (maybe just the DataImportHandler?) not liking empty field elements in the docs, and getting the wrong values into the fields of the index. Here's the entity declaration from data-config.xml for my isolated example:\n\n <document>\n  <entity name=\"contentAsSolrAdd\"\n    dataSource=\"xml\"\n    processor=\"XPathEntityProcessor\"\n    stream=\"true\"\n    url=\"http://example.com/Content.xml\"\n    useSolrAddSchema=\"true\">\n  </entity>\n </document>\n\nAnd here's the Content.xml being pulled in by the DIH:\n\n <add>\n  <doc>\n    <field name=\"empty\"></field>\n    <field name=\"full\">Lorem Ipsum Dolor</field>\n    <field name=\"other\">Some content is me!</field>\n  </doc>\n </add>\n\nAnd here's the relevant portion of the output from the DIH in debug mode:\n\n <lst name=\"document#1\">\n  <str name=\"query\">\n    http://example.com/Content.xml\n  </str>\n  <str name=\"time-taken\">0:0:0.6</str>\n  <str>----------- row #1-------------</str>\n  <str name=\"full\">Some content is me!</str>\n  <str name=\"empty\">Lorem Ipsum Dolor</str>\n  <str>---------------------------------------------</str>\n </lst>\n\nNotice that the field \"full\" doesn't appear here, but the following field \"empty\" has the content that was there for \"full\". The \"other\" field, which was non-empty, and preceded by a non-empty field, shows up correctly.",
