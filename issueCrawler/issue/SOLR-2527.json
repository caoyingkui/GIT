    "description": "When an indexing request is bad, SolrJ just throws an error message - \"Bad Request\" but does not tell you what about the request was wrong.\n\nIn these cases, developer has to look at the Solr Server logs to find out what was bad with request. \nIt would be very helpful if SolrJ could show that error message as well. This would provide an easy way for developers to troubleshoot.\n\nIf you use anything like POSTER or some other tool to post to Solr then you would notice that you get the proper error message back from server in the response body. It confirms that Solr Server is providing all the debug info to client but it is client which is not showing the message.\n\nAn example of bad request can be: \nwhen you are adding a document which is missing a mandatory field.\n\nSolrJ would dump this on console\n---------------\n\nBad Request\n\nrequest: http://localhost:8080/solr/update?wt=xml&version=2.2\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.CommonsHttpSolrServer.request(CommonsHttpSolrServer.java:440)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.CommonsHttpSolrServer.request(CommonsHttpSolrServer.java:244)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.request.AbstractUpdateRequest.process(AbstractUpdateRequest.java:105)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.SolrServer.add(SolrServer.java:74)\n\tat TestClient.main(TestClient.java:50)\n\n\nIf we could provide something like following then it would be more helpful as you can easily notice that a mandatory field is missing.\n\nBad Request\n\nrequest: http://localhost:8080/solr/update?wt=xml&version=2.2\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.CommonsHttpSolrServer.request(CommonsHttpSolrServer.java:440)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.CommonsHttpSolrServer.request(CommonsHttpSolrServer.java:244)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.request.AbstractUpdateRequest.process(AbstractUpdateRequest.java:105)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.SolrServer.add(SolrServer.java:74)\n\tat TestClient.main(TestClient.java:50)\n\n\nresponseBody: \n\n<html><head><title>Apache Tomcat/6.0.32 - Error report</title><style><!--H1 \n{font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:white;background-color:#525D76;font-size:22px;}\n H2 \n{font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:white;background-color:#525D76;font-size:16px;}\n H3 \n{font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:white;background-color:#525D76;font-size:14px;}\n BODY \n{font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:black;background-color:white;}\n B \n{font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:white;background-color:#525D76;}\n P \n{font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;background:white;color:black;font-size:12px;}\nA \n{color : black;}\nA.name \n{color : black;}\nHR \n{color : #525D76;}\n--></style> </head><body><h1>HTTP Status 400 - Document [null] missing required field: bus_id_with_bus_unit_sku</h1><HR size=\"1\" noshade=\"noshade\"><p><b>type</b> Status report</p><p><b>message</b> <u>Document [null] \"missing required field: bus_id_with_bus_unit_sku\"</u></p><p><b>description</b> <u>The request sent by the client was syntactically incorrect (Document [null] missing required field: bus_id_with_bus_unit_sku).</u></p><HR size=\"1\" noshade=\"noshade\"><h3>Apache Tomcat/6.0.32</h3></body></html>\n\n\nIt is very easy to do this with a minimal change in CommonsHttpSolrServer\n\nAttached is a patch which has the modified code and a test case to assert that response body is being shown in the error message",
