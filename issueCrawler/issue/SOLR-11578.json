The first few times you see the legend it'll help, but about the third time I see it I don't need it any more \n\nSo you'd still have\n192.168.1.201 (P)\nas the link, just when you hover over it a pop-up appears with the information..\n\nHmmm, random thought that just popped into my head if it wouldn't be too much work; a tooltip/popup with all the node information would be great, i.e. all the information from state.json for that replica. Nothing fancy here, just the text from the state.json for the node like this.\n \"core_node2\":\n{\n            \"core\":\"eoe12_shard1_replica_n1\",\n            \"base_url\":\"http://192.168.1.201:8981/solr\",\n            \"node_name\":\"192.168.1.201:8981_solr\",\n            \"state\":\"active\",\n            \"type\":\"NRT\",\n            \"leader\":\"true\"}\n,\n\nThis would save me endless switching to see the information I see. If at all possible it would probably be best if this was generated on the fly (i.e. when you hovered your mouse over the link) rather than built up-front. I'm thinking of how big the page would get with a zillion replicas. If you do this be sure to include core_node2 please \n\n ",
