The current impl is fine for Solr, but not for a universally useable factory environment, so needs changes. So I can review your patches before committing  ",

But its also fine how it is implemented at the moment.\n\nSome minor things: the inject field should have no access modifier, as test is in same package, so package-private is fine. Protected means access from subclasses, which is not the case.\n\nThe tests are also fine, ClassPathResourceLoader is fine here! ",

RE  newInstance().getClass() \u2013 yeah not great I know but it's less change and it's possible the resourceLoader's resolution might involve more overhead which would get triggered on every create(TokenStream) call so I went for this approach.\n\nI'll commit soonish.
