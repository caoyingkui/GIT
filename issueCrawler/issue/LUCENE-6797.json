            "content": "Michael McCandless This patch performs the necessary class rearrangement, but doesn't handle the degenerate cases properly yet.\n\nPlease note that I moved the GeoCircle.java class to GeoStandardCircle.java, and then created a new interface called GeoCircle.java.  The patch may not therefore apply happily.  I've also left a \"nocommit\" in the GeoCircleFactory class that will need to be addressed.  But that is straightforward, and for now we can actually just go ahead and commit, I think, since any improvements will simply make the method \"makeGeoCircle()\" handle more cases.\n\nThere should be no functional changes, just structural ones.  Any questions please feel free to ask.\n "
