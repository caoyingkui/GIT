    "description": "as discussed in SOLR-9480 and noted in TODO comments, the original SKG code base had a \"min_pop\" option that would completely ignore \"terms\" if the fg/bg popularities weren't above a user specified threshold.  with the implementation of SKG as a relatedness() aggregation function, we need to leave any actual filtering of buckets by an aggregation result to a future generalized JSON facet enhancement, but what we can do today is implement an optional min_popularity option on relatedness() that forces the relatedness score to -Infinity so buckets that don't meat the threshold at least score \"as low as possible\"",

One key aspect of my comments there that is directly signifincat to this issue is the question of the name \"min_popularity\" and wether it makes sense to re-think that...\n\nas far as trying to maintain the same option names \u2013 i don't know that that is feasible or really makes sense \u2013 at least in so much as adding new options to relatedness() using hte same names as the existing options on significantTerms.\u00a0 notably the existing minDocFreq option on significantTerms is similar in concept to the min_popularity option proposed in SOLR-12581 for relatedness(), but it would not really make sense to use minDocFreq as the option name in SOLR-12581 since the relatedness() function isn't tied to \"terms\" the way significantTerms is \u2013 so \"docFreq\" has no real meaning, and the more general \"popularity\" makes more sense (i suppose we could change the option name in signifncatTerms \u2013 but even then significantTerms doesn't produce the same concept of \"popularity\" that relatedness() does, andeven if it did because that that expression focuses exclusively on \"terms\" the concept of \"DocFreq\" is very appropriate.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 ",
