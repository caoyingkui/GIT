Given this, (2) may be simpler (adding directly to facet response) as we already have a framework for merging. (From SOLR-8228)\n\nProbably better to use a separate merger to merge facet telemetry information. The main reason is that facet telemetry merging may be different to facet result merging. For example, some fields in facet telemetry are not merged. In addition, the merged telemetry need to contain both merged numbers and telemetry from each shards.\n\ncc Yonik Seeley ",
