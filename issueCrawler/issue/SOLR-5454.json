    "description": "I use big hierarchical search query with boolean queries on different levels. After main search I do some post filtering and need to recursively visit scorer's tree using Scorer#getChildren() method. And I've got hotspot here - in BooleanScorer2#getChildren() new list of children scorers created and collected on every call i.e. on every matched document. I think we can eliminate this hotspot by creating this list once as children scorers won't change there state.",
