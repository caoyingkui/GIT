    "description": "With LUCENE-843, it's now possible for a subset of a document's\nfields/terms to be indexed or stored when an exception is hit.  This\nwas not the case in the past (it was \"all or none\").\n\nI plan to make it \"all or none\" again by immediately marking a\ndocument as deleted if any exception is hit while indexing it.\n\nDiscussion leading up to this:\n\n  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/56103",

Instead,\n    we now print this message to infoStream, if set:\n\n\n\n      WARNING: document contains at least one immense term (longer than the max length 16383), all of which were skipped.  Please correct the analyzer to not produce such terms.  The prefix of the first immense term is: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...'\n\n\n\tStill increment position when we hit a massive term\n\n\n\n\n\tAn unhandled \"non-aborting\" exception immediately marks the\n    document that hit the exception as deleted.  I added comments at\n    the top of DocumentsWriter to explain aborting vs non-aborting\n    exceptions.  This change actually adds the infrastructure for\n    deleting by doc ID, which we've discussed adding to IW in the\n    past, but, I haven't exposed any public APIs for doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\tNo longer log to infoStream how many docs were deleted on flush\n    since that deletion count is not accurate when mixing delete by\n    term and by docID.\n\n ",
