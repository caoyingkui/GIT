    "description": "The JettyWebappTest straddles example and src/webapp in a way that the Plugin classloader's parent WebappClassloader points to src/webapp which has no libs dir. This can cause problems - eg its a problem with the current velocity setup - though the issue has been skirted by removing slf logging references.\n\nProbably the best solution is to run off the webapp - but I wonder if its worth depending on building the webapp for tests when all of them don't need it.",
