These are available for any Solr committer but are not available to the general public.\n\nI ran \n\nant -Drun.clover=true clean clover test generate-clover-reports\n\n\n\nto generate the link above.  Clover will not be run by default.  It probably would be useful to hook this into the nightly build, but you have to be careful to make sure the instrumented files don't get shipped in the release.
