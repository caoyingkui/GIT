    "description": "Expose Lucene's SpanFirst capability in Solr's extended Dismax query parser. This issue adds the SF-parameter (SpanFirst) and takes a FIELD~DISTANCE^BOOST formatted value.\n\nFor example, sf=title~5^2 will give a boost of 2 if one of the normal clauses, originally generated for automatic phrase queries, is located within five positions from the field's start.\n\nUnit test is included and all tests pass.",
