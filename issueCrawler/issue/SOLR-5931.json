If I unload the core and then add it back, in the \u201cCore Admin\u201d section of the admin UI, then the changes in solrcore.properties do take effect.\n\nMy specific test case is a DataImportHandler where db-data-config.xml uses a property to decide which DB host to talk to:\n\n\n<dataSource driver=\"org.postgresql.Driver\" name=\"meta\" url=\"jdbc:postgresql://${dbhost}/${solr.core.name}\" .../>\n\n\n\nWhen I change that dbhost property in solrcore.properties and reload the core, the next dataimport operation still connects to the previous DB host. Reloading the dataimport config does not help. I have to unload the core (or fully restart the whole Solr) for the properties change to take effect.",

As a result, some configuration options can not be changed and made active with a simple RELOAD...\n\nIndexWriter related settings in <indexConfig>\n<dataDir> location\n-----------\n\nNot sure if this includes properties defined in solrcore.properties file.\n\nGary\n "

I'll ask on the user list for these kind of questions going forward.\n\nRegarding your suggestion: i am aware of such support, but not sure how this is different from changing the \"replication for slave\" section of solrconfig.xml on master solr. In both cases, you will need to make a change on master box, and it can take up to few minutes for the files to be replicated (especially if u have multiple level of replication hierarchy, for example master A-> repeater B->slave C). I understand that this may be the only workaround available though, as there appears to be no other way of getting RELOAD to re-read a local property file (like solrconfig.properties) which is not meant to be replicable.

Updating solrconfig.xml directly for particular slave doesn't work well because the change will get overwritten on each replication (unless we change this in master's solrconfig as well)\n\nOne option is using xinclude in your solrconfig.xml file.  In solrconfig.xml, you would have something like this:\n\n\n<requestHandler name=\"/replication\" class=\"solr.ReplicationHandler\" xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\">\n  <lst name=\"slave\">\n    <xi:include href=\"masterUrl.xml\">\n      <xi:fallback><str name=\"masterUrl\">http://default_master:port/solr/corename</str></xi:fallback>\n    </xi:include>\n    <!-- other replication options -->\n  </lst>\n</requestHandler>\n\n\n\nWith this config, normally masterUrl does not need to exist.  When you need to switch the master URL, create masterUrl.xml in the same location as solrconfig.xml and reload/restart.  It needs contents like this:\n\n\n    <str name=\"masterUrl\">http://master_host:port/solr/corename</str>\n\n\n\nYou can also do this without the fallback, in which case you'd use a config like this and masterUrl.xml would always need to exist.\n\n\n<requestHandler name=\"/replication\" class=\"solr.ReplicationHandler\" xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\">\n  <lst name=\"slave\">\n    <xi:include href=\"masterUrl.xml\" />\n    <!-- other replication options -->\n  </lst>\n</requestHandler>\n\n\n\nAs long as you don't include masterUrl.txt in the list of config files to replicate, it won't get overwritten on the slave.\n\nThis is only to give you the general idea of xinclude.  You can rearrange this in any way that you require. "
