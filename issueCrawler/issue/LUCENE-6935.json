    "description": "Currently TestGeoPointQuery and TestDimensionalQueries only create bounding box polygons to test PointInPolygonQuery. This provides coverage for testing basic functionality but lacks critical testing with true random shapes. Random shape generation needs to be added to BaseGeoPointTestCase and used in newPolygonQuery for GeoPoint and DimensionalQuery testing.",
