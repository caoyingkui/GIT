    "description": "a bad logic in CoreContainer. it will assign a default name using checkDefault(name) while the core name is not specified.\ne.g.\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=UNLOAD\nor append whatever uncrect param like:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=UNLOAD&appname=wop\n\nthose request both unload the core \"collection1\"(cause the default core name is \"collection1\" in solr)\nthis bad behavior appear on \"reload\"/\"swap\"/\"rename\"/\"remove\" and \"getCore(String)\" operation\n\nhere, checkDefault() should throw exception rather than assign a name quietly\n\nI'd fixed rename/remove/reload/swap. but getCore(name) be invoked by too many methods. I'm not sure weather this also lead some potential issue now. I'd rather believe it does. those invoker should be double check in next version",
