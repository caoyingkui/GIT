    "description": "Nightly benchmarks had been failing to run for a while due to trunk API changes, but when I finally fixed those, the indexer fails because IW.maxDoc disagrees with the number of documents indexed after all threads are done indexing.\n\nIt's sort of crazy none of our tests caught this!\n\nI tracked down the bug; it was caused in LUCENE-7868.  The bug is not as bad as it sounds: documents are not in fact lost, it's just IW's internal accounting for maxDoc that's temporarily incorrect until you do a refresh or commit or close the index.\n\nI'm marking as blocker for 7.0.",
