So ideally whatever working before should work (URP solrconfig param(s)) and if parameters are passed in the request too, they will override the solrconfig ones. Am I going the right way?\n\n\nNote that you could use some SolrTestCaseJ4 conveniences like params(\"param\", \"value\") instead of explicit ModifiableSolrParams. And you could use req(params) instead of creating a LocalSolrQueryRequest manually.

Thank you for those pointers. ",

In this way it's just like a request handler definition.\n\nI wonder if there should be a larger discussion (not expressly for this particular URP) about this overall.  For example, what should the conventions be on parameter naming?   <abbreviatedUrpName>.<paramName> ?  Should abbreviated URP names be initial lowercase (thus \"uuid\" not \"UUID\").  I think so.  And is there a way to have an URP registered multiple times with different configurations each?  Perhaps up to some factories.  I recently wrote a custom URP that applies regexes to extract new fields from others, and I made the factory recognize when it needed to add multiple URP instances.  Perhaps some of our current URPs apply; but perhaps many don't because they are already based on configurations that have mechanisms to match multiple fields. ",
