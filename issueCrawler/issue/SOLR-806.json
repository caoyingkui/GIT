    "description": "The m2-deploy task uses the authentication element with the username and privateKey attribute to set the user credentials. Unfortunately the privateKey attribute is only applicable for ssh connections. \n\nQuote from http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks.html:\nIt accepts the attributes username, password, and for SSH based repositories privateKey and passphrase.\n\nTherefore authentication fails for non-ssh connections. I worked around that by using the \"password\" attribute instead of privateKey. However I'd prefer not having to modify the build file.",
