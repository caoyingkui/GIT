    "description": "There are currently a ton of conditionals checking for various problems, as well as a horribly confusing unbalanced decrement + increment, and in general the code is a nightmare to follow.\n\nTo make it worse, besides being confusing it doesnt handle all cases: e.g. a negative position increment gap from the analyzer will just result in total chaos (corruption etc).\n\nI think an easier way to implement this is to init fieldinvertstate.position to -1, and for the logic to be:\n\n\n  position += posincr;\n  check that position >= 0 && position >= lastPosition\n  lastPosition = position;",

I also pulled out the 'boost && omitNorms check' into the caller, because its unrelated to inverting the tokenstream. \n\nWe should try to keep invert() simple. ",
