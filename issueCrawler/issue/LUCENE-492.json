    "description": "PhraseQuery's explain method returns bogus scores in the case where the phrase doesn't match.  Unless i'm crazy, it can even indicate a match when one of the terms doesn't even appear in the document.\n\nThis can be particularly confusing when looking at the explain output for a doc that matches a large boolean query in spite of failing to match on a PhraseQuery which is part of that BQ.\n\n\nI'll try to attach an isolated test case shortly.",
