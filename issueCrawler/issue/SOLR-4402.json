    "description": "I needed to index multiple fields from a table dynamically. At first it didn't work, reading the field name as \"_t\". Out of curiosity, I added a transformer declaration to the entity. This gave me the list of fields I needed.\n\nWhy did adding a transformer that is never used fix my problem? Removing the transformer declaration causes the problem to come back, and it does not matter which transformer I declare.\n\nI am running Solr 4.1, and this issue first happened to me on the included example-DIH example that came with the download. I read the Solr reference guide for 4.0, and could not find a reason why adding a transformer made it work.\n\nBelow is the db-data-config.xml file:\n\n \n    <dataConfig>\n\t<dataSource name=\"foo\" driver=\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\" url=\"jdbc:mysql://localhost/foo\"  user=\"fakeadmin\" password=\"fakepass\"/>\n\t<document>\n\t\t<entity name=\"products\" query=\"select * from `product`\">\n\t\t\t<field name=\"id\" column=\"id\" />\n\t\t\t<entity name=\"names\" query=\"select * from names where productId = '${products.id}'\" transformer=\"LogTransformer\">\n\t\t\t\t<field name=\"${names.fieldName}_t\" column=\"fieldValue\"/>\n\t\t\t</entity>\n\t\t</entity>\n\t</document>\n</dataConfig>",
