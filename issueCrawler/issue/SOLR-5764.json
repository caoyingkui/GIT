    "description": "Tests that were recently added have the problems that some of them were using ExternalPaths.SOURCE_HOME and adding the absolute location of modules. This makes it impossible to move modules around or run them standalone.\n\nThis issue fixes those tests to use SolrTestCaseJ4.getFile() or a simple openResourceAsStream from classpath, because all test-files are located in classpath. ExternalPaths.SOURCE_HOME will be hidden (private) so nothing can use it anymore - so no new tests should appear using them again.\n\nWhile doing this, I recognized that the recently added morphlines and mapreduce contribs are duplicating modified solr example folders into their test-files folder, while morphlines-core was referring from inside the tests to map-reduce/test-files (ignoring the whole megabytes of test-files of morphlines!!! Easy to see, because the config files in it were just broken and referring to non-existent classes). This is the reverse of the natural dependency, where map-reduce uses morphlines as dep.\n\nThe fix here is to completely delete/empty the test-files folders of map-reduce and morphlines-cell and let those reuse the one from morphlines-core. Morphlines-core is now the only source folder for test-files, shared by all three contribs. Its contents are now the previous map-reduce/test-files folder.\n\nI will provide a patch with the code changes, but the cleanup of morphlines test-files cannot be described here, it is too crazy. I will just heavy commit the changes, sorry!",

I focused pretty much just on getting something committed that could pass all our checks and tests, so there is probably a fair amount of cleanup yet to do. That's part of the driving force behind marking it experimental. It would also be good to take into account other developers opinions on the API's and such. "

This patch also hides the constant to get source home dir, so tests cannot use it.\n\nThe file moves in morphlines are not included.\n\nThis patch also removes the copy of src/test-files to build/test-files (which was a hack to prevent broken test from overriding test-files). The security manager prevents this, so this is no longer needed. "
