Either way: I'm pretty happy that it's already solved. :]\n\nI hate to nitpick, but as I checked the source (always happy to learn something), I noticed a typo in the block comment above CurrencyValue.parse():\n\n   * <p/>\n   * Currency values are expected to be in the format &lt;amount&gt;,&lt;currency code&gt;,\n   * for example, \"500,USD\" would represent 5 U.S. Dollars.\n   * <p/>\n\n\n\nI assume it should be \"... 500 U.S. Dollars ...\" "

Will file a separate issue.\nAlso, polishing JavaDocs can be dealt with post 4.0.0 release. "
