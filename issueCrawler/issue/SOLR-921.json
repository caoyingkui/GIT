    "description": "every class that is loaded through SolrResourceLoader does a Class.forName() and when if it is not found a ClassNotFoundExcepton is thrown\n\nThen , it looks up with the various packages and finds the right class if the name starts with solr. Considering the fact that we usually use this solr.<classname> format we pay too much of a price for this. After every lookup the result can be cached in a static Map<String, String> with short name as keys and fully qualified name as values and can be shared across all the cores and this Map can be stored at the CoreContainer level.",

            "content": "if i understand correctly, the goal here is to reduce the number of Class.forName calls on the same \"cname\" once we've already retrieved an instance of a class using that cname, and the patch does this by caching in a static map from cname=>Class\n\ntwo things concern me about this...\n\n1) the first time findClass(\"solr.FooBarBaz\", \"yak\", \"wak\") is called the patched code could make at most three Class.forName calls (\"solr.FooBarBaz\", \"yak.FooBarBaz\", \"wak.FooBarBaz\").  assume \"wak.FooBarBaz\" winds up being the true class name that acutally get's loaded.  the next time someone calls findClass(\"solr.FooBarBaz\", \"yak\", \"wak\") no calls to Class.forName are made because \"solr.FooBarBaz\" is found in the cache.  The problem comes up when a call is made to  findClass(\"solr.FooBarBaz\", \"xxxxx\", \"yyyyy\") ... \"wak.FooBarBaz\" is returned from the cache, even though that package wasn't even on the list of packages hte client was interested in.  if we're going to cache these results, the full arg list needs to be the cache key\n\n2) the cache is a static map in the SolrResourceLoader class.  unless i'm mistaken, there's only going to be a single instance of that for the entire Solr app (SolrResourceLoader will be loaded by the main/parent loader) which means that cache will cause Class object references to bleed over from one SolrCore to another (ie: i have a FooBarBaz plugin in my core1 lib, and that's different then the FooBarBaz plugin in core2 (or a differnet version).  Changing the cacche to just be an instance variable of SolrResourceLoader should solve this ... there's only one SolrResourceLoader per core (right?)\n "

The ideal solution is to consider the package names also in the key . I have ignored those usecases for simplicity. I have also ignored cases where classes are loaded by parent classloader. Ideally the classloader also must be considered for making the key for the cache . \n\nThis is useful when cores are loaded/unloaded very frequently and there are a large number of cores (tens of thousands) . In other cases the perf benefits are negligible. \n\nWhen loading plugins they are rarely loaded using the solr.<cname> .If we use a fully qualified name then the ClassNotFoundExceptions are not thrown and the cost is low and not worth optimizing.   So I have ignored all such cases \n\nCaching the classes on a SolrResopurceLoader instance level means one core cannot benefit from the 'learnings' of another core.\n\n\n "

So these can be shared by all cores.\n\nOn #2 \u2013 When you put custom classes in $solr_home/lib, they have different packages from Solr's own packages. So one would most likely put the fully qualified class name. In that case the caching won't happen.\n\nThe only problem right now is that if you want to override a class supplied by Solr by adding a jar to the $solr_home/lib, it won't take precedence. This can be fixed easily before we commit. "

I also see the new addition that only stores in the cache if the classloader used is the same as that of the SolrResourceLoader (to prevent bleed over from one core to another).  \n\nBut honestly: the whole idea of tricks like this seems overly risky to me considering how easy it is to get into \"classloader hell\" with java.  \n\nDoes anyone have any profiling info they can share showing that this patch actually improves performance in any particular usecases? (without adversely affecting it in the common use cases)\n\nEven if the package searching behavior of SolrResourceLoader really is that expensive, then I'd rather encourage people to stop using the solr.* aliasing and start explicitly using FQN for classes.  I can't imagine Class.findClass on an already initialized classname is measurably slower then pulling a class instance out of this cache.\n\n(The short names were designed just to make the example configs easier to read, but if people in high load environments where cores are added/removed all the time find the package alias resolution to be prohibitively expensive on core initialization, then just don't use that that syntactic feature)\n\nIf someone has numbers showing that the cache really is faster even when specifying FQNs in the configs, then I'd be convinced, but otherwise ..... ugh, ... it just seems like a bad idea to go down this road.

            "content": "\nBut my question is , are we saying this fix is too complex and hard to understand? Or is it the \"fear of the unknown\" that is holding us back?\n\nMy main concerns are: \n1) that caching classes adds complexity to solve a performance problem that could/should easily be avoidable by config change (using FQN instead of aliases)\n2) I am in fact scared that caching classes may have unexpected adverse behavior in atypical JVMs/servlet containers that we aren't familiar with ... mucking with class loading is something that's notoriously problematic, so i'd prefer we get involved in it only as a matter of last resort\n\nThe package names of all the classes we use in solrconfig/schema is never advertised.\n\nFirst off: i don't think that really true. the example configs may never refer to the full name, but every place we document classes on the wiki we link to their javadcos with full names, and we do have a  comment in the example configs explaining what full packages the \"solr.*\"  prefix is an alias for.  \n\nThe aliasing feature was introduced early on to help the readability of the configs, and initially had essentially 0 cost (because the aliasing resolution was only done once at server startup).  Documenting that people who deal with a high rate of core creation should avoid using the aliases (on the CoreAdmin page perhaps) and better advertising the full names of every class seems like a much simpler, risk free, solution.\n\nSo we can just cache short-name -> FQN and we are still fine.\n\nEh.  \n\nI'm still in favor of just documenting that people who want to create cores quickly should use the FQNs \u2013 especially since it keeps the code simpler \u2013 but i'm not opposed to caching the String->String mappings if you guys really think that's better.\n "

It is the negative lookups which are costly because firstly, they are not cached and secondly, Solr's retry logic is based on ClassNotFoundException being thrown.\n\n\n\nI'm still in favor of just documenting that people who want to create cores quickly should use the FQNs - especially since it keeps the code simpler - but i'm not opposed to caching the String->String mappings if you guys really think that's better.\n\nI really think this is a good solution. No more mucking around with the classloader. It solves the original problem well (i.e. subsequent instantiation can use the FQN which is fast) and the code is simpler to understand too.
