    "description": "hi, i'm using DataImportHandler to import my data from database to solr index. in db-data-import.xml i have i query like this:\n\n<document name=\"products\">\n        <entity name=\"product\" pk=\"products.id\" Query=\"SELECT products.id products.name, features.props FROM products JOIN features ON products.id=features.product_id GROUP BY features.product_id\"   deltaQuery=\"SELECT products.id from products where products.lastMod>'${dataimport.last_modify}'\">          \n            <field name=\"id\" column=\"id\" />\n            <field name=\"name\" column=\"name\" boost=\"4.0\" />\n        </entity>\n  </document>\n\ndon't be attend at the database structs, problem is when i use delta-import, the sql query to mysql by solr will look like \"$Query\" + \"WHERE pk=\n{ id return by deltaQuery }\n\" , this will cause sql query syntax error because WHERE keyword must be appear in front of GROUP BY keyword. i don't know how to solr this problem. please help me.\n\nthanks.",

If this is not present , DIH tries to construct the import query by(after identifying the delta) modifying the 'query' (this is error prone). There is a namespace ${dataimporter.delta.<column-name>} which can be used in this query. e.g: select * from tbl where id=${dataimporter.delta.id}\n\nNote \u2013 This is a Solr 1.4 feature so you must use a nightly build.
