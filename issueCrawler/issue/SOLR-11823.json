    "description": "I'm running Solr 7.1 (didn't test other versions) in SolrCloud mode ona a 3-node cluster and tried using the backup/restore API for the first time. Backup worked fine, but when trying to restore the backed-up collection I ran into an unexpected problem with the replication factor setting.\n\nI expected the command below to restore a backup of the collection \"demo\" with 3 shards, creating 2 replicas per shard. Instead it's trying to create 6 replicas per shard:\n\n\n# curl -s -k 'https://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=restore&name=demo&location=/srv/backup/solr/solr-dev&collection=demo&maxShardsPerNode=2&replicationFactor=2'\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": 400,\n    \"msg\": \"Solr cloud with available number of nodes:3 is insufficient for restoring a collection with 3 shards, total replicas per shard 6 and maxShardsPerNode 2. Consider increasing maxShardsPerNode value OR number ofavailable nodes.\",\n    \"metadata\": [\n      \"error-class\",\n      \"org.apache.solr.common.SolrException\",\n      \"root-error-class\",\n      \"org.apache.solr.common.SolrException\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"exception\": {\n    \"rspCode\": 400,\n    \"msg\": \"Solr cloud with available number of nodes:3 is insufficient for restoring a collection with 3 shards, total replicas per shard 6 and maxShardsPerNode 2.

The documentation also didn't lead me to expect this behavior:\n\n\nreplicationFactor\n\n   The number of replicas to be created for each shard.",
