            "content": "You can get more fields then you request if a DocumentTransformer uses `getExtraRequestFields()` SOLR-7622 \u2013 this should tell Lucene to fetch the field, but should not affect the fields returned in the final SolrDocument.  An 'off-the-shelf' example is with the new 'geo' transformer:\n\nfrom the attached patch\n+    // Don't return 'store_rpt' just because it is required by the transformer\n+    rf = new SolrReturnFields( req(\"fl\", \"[geo f=store_rpt]\") );\n+    assertFalse( rf.wantsScore() );\n+    assertTrue(rf.wantsField(\"[geo]\"));\n+    assertFalse( rf.wantsField( \"store_rpt\" ) );\n+    assertFalse(rf.wantsAllFields());\n+    assertNotNull(rf.getTransformer());\n\n\n\nI think there are other possible cases, but most of the time, when a transformer renames the field, it removes the SolrDocument so the fact that ReturnFields allows the original name does not matter.  For example:\n\n fl=aaa:bbb\n\n\n\nWithout this patch,\n\n returnFields.wantsField( 'bbb' ) == true\n\n\n\n\nSadly, I don't fully understand what's about and what all this wantsFoo, okFoo means\n\nThe distinction is between what fields are requested from Lucene and put on the SolrDocument passed to the DocumentTransformers vs what fields the end user wants to see in the results.  \n\n\n ",
