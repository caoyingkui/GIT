    "description": "If you are using term vectors for fast vector highlighting along with a multivalue field while matching a phrase that crosses two elements, then it will not properly highlight even though it properly finds the correct values to highlight.\n\nA good example of this is when matching source code, where you might have lines like:\n\n\none two three five\ntwo three four\nfive six five\nsix seven eight nine eight nine eight nine eight nine eight nine eight nine\neight nine\nten eleven\ntwelve thirteen\n\n\n\nMatching the phrase \"four five\" will return\n\n\ntwo three four\nfive six five\nsix seven eight nine eight nine eight nine eight nine eight\neight nine\nten eleven\n\n\n\nHowever, it does not properly highlight \"four\" (on the first line) and \"five\" (on the second line) and it is returning too many lines, but not all of them.\n\nThe problem lies in the BaseFragmentsBuilder at line 269 because it is not checking for cross-coverage. Here is a possible solution:\n\n\nboolean started = toffs.getStartOffset() >= fieldStart;\nboolean ended = toffs.getEndOffset() <= fieldEnd;\n\n// existing behavior:\nif (started && ended) {\n    toffsList.add(toffs);\n    toffsIterator.remove();\n}\nelse if (started) {\n    toffsList.add(new Toffs(toffs.getStartOffset(), field.end));\n    // toffsIterator.remove(); // is this necessary?\n}\nelse if (ended) {\n    toffsList.add(new Toffs(fieldStart, toff.getEndOffset()));\n    // toffsIterator.remove(); // is this necessary?\n}\nelse if (toffs.getEndOffset() > fieldEnd) {\n    // ie the toff spans whole field\n    toffsList.add(new Toffs(fieldStart, fieldEnd));\n    // toffsIterator.remove(); // is this necessary?\n}",
