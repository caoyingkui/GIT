    "description": "I have a date field as follows:\n\n<field name=\"ETD\" type=\"date\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" multiValued=\"false\" />\n...\n<fieldType name=\"date\" class=\"solr.TrieDateField\" precisionStep=\"0\" positionIncrementGap=\"0\"/>\n\nIn my data set I have unset fields (null), dates which are pre EPOCH (e.g. 1930-02-13T23:00:00Z) and dates which are post EPOCH (e.g. 2000-12-31T23:00:00Z). When sorting in ascending order, I would expect the null fields to be considered the ones with the lowest values, for example:\nnull\n1930-02-13T23:00:00Z\n2000-12-31T23:00:00Z\n\nWhat I get however is:\n1930-02-13T23:00:00Z\nnull\n2000-12-31T23:00:00Z\n\nIt looks like null is not handled as the lowest possible value for a date field.",
