Very useful when developing an algorithm and to be sure it's doing what you think it is. \n\n*Also now actually points to the correct configs folder in the internal example algs, and doesn't silently use the example config (or last used) when it cannot find the specified config file.

It's still somewhat hackey though.\n\nBecause you need to apply the benchmark patch to get things working, I count on that checkout existing and being patched in a specific location. It drives the benchmark, but talks to a running Solr that is started from a checkout. I use git so that it's really cheap to flip through revs and run benchmarks.\n\nThe main driver is an ugly .sh script - it accepts a few params (name of the chart, where to write result files, location of alg file, date range of checkouts to run the alg against, and the interval to try between days).\n\nFor instance, you might say, run the indexing benchmark over the period of 2012-01-04 to 2012-07-15 and do it once for every 5 days.\n\nThis happens and the output of the benchmarks are dumped into a folder.\n\nThen I have a simple java cmd line app that will process the result folder. It takes a chart name, the location of results folder, and a list of named regexes - each regex pointing to the pertinent data to pull from the results file. The java app pulls out all the data, writes a csv file, and outputs a simple line chart.\n\nI don't know how cleaned up this will get, i won't post any of it for now - but I may get to the point of running some stuff locally automatically and pushing to a webserver with the charts etc, al la Lucene.

My current system just extracts info from benchmark result files - so it can extract the result of any benchmark you can make - if thats a mb/s result, that's no problem.

I expected that commons-logging (being a transitive dependency) should have been inside the solrj-lib directory but it isn't.\n\nIsn't dist/solrj-lib supposed to have all dependencies of solrj (including transitive ones)?\n\nOnly transitive dependencies that Solrj will use should be included.  \n\nI know very little about logging, but shouldn't jcl-over-slf4j-*.jar be used here?  I think its job is to intercept commons-logging calls and then slf4j will push them through wherever it's configured to go (log4j by default I think). "

Whether to use the commons-logging or jcl-over-slf4j jar depends on which slf4j binding the final application will use.  If the user binds slf4j to jcl with slf4j-jcl, then they need the actual commons-logging jar.  If the user chooses any other binding, jcl-over-slf4j is required.  We can't make that choice for the user, which I think means that the SolrJ documentation must explain these details. "
