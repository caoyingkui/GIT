    "description": "Hi,\u00a0\nWe used Solr Cloud 7.1.0(3 nodes, 3 shards with 2 replicas). When we used\u00a0\ngroup query, we found that the number of docs in each group depends on the\u00a0\nrows number(group number).\u00a0\n\nWhen the rows bigger then 5, the return docs are correct and stable, for the\u00a0\nrest, the number of docs is smaller than the actual result.\u00a0\n\nCould you please explain why and give me some suggestion about how to decide\u00a0\nthe rows number?",
