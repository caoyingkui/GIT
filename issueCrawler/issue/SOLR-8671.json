    "description": "Currently DateStatsValues#sum is defined as long, and returned as a date. This has two problems: It overflows (with ~6 million values), and the return value can be a date like <date name=\"sum\">122366-06-12T21:06:06Z</date>. I think we should just change this stat to a double. See SOLR-8420.\nI think we can change this only in master, since it will break backward compatibility.",
