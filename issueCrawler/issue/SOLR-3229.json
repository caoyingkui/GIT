            "content": "Hang: Thank you for your patch.\n\nI agree, the \"docid\" as a key is dangerous and misleading in distributed mode, and we should switch to using the uniqueKey when available, but if we leave things as you had it in your patch, existing (single node) users who don't have a uniqueKey field would no longer be able to get term vectors at all.\n\nI updated your patch to leave the key alone if there is no uniqueKey, and eliminate the \"doc-\" prefix when there is one.  I also added a new distributed test to prove that everything is working, and that turned up a few problems - some of which i fixed (dealing with warnings, and ensuring that TVC results are in the correct order for the result documents).\n\nOne thing i discovered that i'm not sure about is what to do about the \"df\" and \"tf-idf\" values when requested. in the test they have to be ignored because the way the distributed test works is to create a single node instance and compare it with a multi-node instance that has identical documents, and in the distributed TVC code, these won't match up \u2013 but i'm not sure if that's a bug (because the df & tf-idf values aren't \"merged\" from all nodes) or a feature (because you get the real df & tf-idf values for that term for that doc from the shard it lives in) ... either way it shouldn't stop fixing the basic problem of TVC failing painfully in a distributed request, so i've opened SOLR-3720 to track this in the future.\n\nfeedback on this revised patch/test would be appreciated "

It's all up to you to keep \"doc-\" or not - it seems to me if you keep it, you can reduce lots of changes in tests. Other than that I don't have any comment on test thinking of my little to no knowledge on solr's test framework.\n\nI remember I read something regarding df/tf-idf in distributed mode is a highly anticipated feature, I don't expect that can be done easily, I'm good to have a bug there.

            "content": "Hoss Man HighlightComponent, DebugComponent, and TermVectorComponent have a very similar bit of code in their finishStage() method. HighlightComponent & DebugComponent's version was recently found to be buggy \u2013 SOLR-8060 and SOLR-8059.  The Highlight side was recently fixed and I'm about to do the same for Debug side.  But I'd like to refactor out some common lines of code between all 3 to ease maintenance.  However the TV side has this odd bit where it if it can't lookup the shard doc by it's unique key, that it adds this to the response any way (~line 458).  I would rather we remove this; I think it's not something we should support.  UniqueKey should be required for distributed-search to get TV info back.  The code that's here now incorrectly assumes that if it was unable to lookup the key in the resultIds that it's because the schema has no uniqueKey.  But another reason is just that it's a distrib.singlePass distributed search (related to the 2 bugs I'm looking at in Highlight & Debug components).  Do you support my recommendation? "
