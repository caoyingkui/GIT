    "description": "Just wanted to let you know, in accordance to the Contribution Guidelines, that I created a pull request on GitHub (https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/374).\nCommit Message\n\nImprove detection of recreated lock files\n\nI've been running into issues with the detection of deleted and then\nrecreated files when using GlusterFS. Since, on most platforms, there\nare more reliable ways to detect recreated files, I decided improved\nthe detection of such files.\n\nBackground:\n\nAs part of LUCENE-6508 [3] detection of recreated files was added.\nIn such a case, another instance may have obtained lock on the newly\ncreated file. This isn't something that should happen on a properly\nconfigured Solr instance but there is a good chance for this\nhappening when an index is shared by multiple instances that use a\ndifferent locking mechanism.\n\nImplementation:\n\nOn platform that support it, fileKey() [1] is now used. On Unix-like\nsystems this key consists of the device ID and and inode. For locks\nthat keep the lock file open, this should ensure we detect recreation\nsince no two files can have the same device ID and inode even if the\nlast hard link has been removed already. Other locks, that don't keep\nthe file open, should still detect recreation at a low error rate.\n\nPlatforms without fileKey() support keep using the creation timestamp\nor modification timestamp (subject to availability) [2].\n\n[1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/attribute/BasicFileAttributes.html#fileKey--\n[2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/attribute/BasicFileAttributes.html#creationTime--\n[3]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6508",
