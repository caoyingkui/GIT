    "description": "When reviewing the flexible queryparser with my GSoC student, I found some String.toLowerCase() calls without locale. Also some code iterates per-char and lowercases. We should fix this to behave exactly like LowerCaseFilter.\n\nMaybe we can make the queryparser pass all tokens to lowercase through a KeywordTokenizer->LowerCaseFilter chain, but this would create dependency to analysis module.",
