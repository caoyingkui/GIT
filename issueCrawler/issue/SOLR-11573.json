    "description": "With the completion of SOLR-11032, the \"Using SolrJ\" page in the ref-guide now imports some Java code snippets from an external file.  This is done to allow the snippets appearing in the documentation to be compiled/run as part of the build...so they will always stay up to date.\n\nDuring the ref-guide build, this external file is copied into the ref-guide build directory so that the references to it can be resolved.  However, anyone using the \"live preview\" feature of modern asciidoc editors (Atom, etc.), will find that the snippets don't appear in their live-preview.  Depending on your editor, a discrete error message may be displayed.\n\nIt would be nice to fix this \"papercut\" in usability, or at least provide a workaround.  The easier we can make it to improve the docs, the better.",

This follows the pattern established by the existing ant eclipse and ant intellij targets.\n\nThere might be other better solutions too, these are just two options. ",

This allows us to drop the Java-file copying too.\n\nThe only caveat is that for asciidoctor to access the included-files (which are outside of its chroot), I had to turn \"safe-mode\" off in the Jekyll config.  I'm still poking around the asciidoctor docs to see what exactly this setting controls.  It seems innocent to disable, given how we're using asciidoctor, but I'm still double checking.  Anyone have any context on the scope of this setting?\n\nAnyway, if the property ends up being safe to leave disabled, then this patch is ready for review.  Precommit passes, fwiw. ",

One of the things \"unsafe\" mode allows you to do is include files - the include directive only works in certain circumstances unless it's in \"unsafe\" (which is why safe mode is disabled for the PDF).\n\nThis section of the Asciidoctor User Manual describes what is and isn't allowed with each mode: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#running-asciidoctor-securely. I personally think the risk is low for our purposes. ",

My understanding of the inheritance here is that the param on the document overrides the param set in our config files (\"passed to the API or CLI\" as described here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attribute-assignment-precedence), which would mean that the path would be incorrect during build (it would go only to solr/build instead of solr).\n\nDo you have any insights on this from looking at this closer than I have?
