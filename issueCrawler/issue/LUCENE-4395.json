    "description": "In working on LUCENE-4366 I realized we are doing this today (and then Robert reminded me BS2 is also doing it), which is really quite silly.\n\nSeems like a fast fix would be to wrap such clauses in ConstantScoreQuery ... but further improvements are possible with BooleanScorer:\n\n\n\tDon't add the bucket to the valid list\n\n\n\n\n\tIf the current clause is not prohibited, but this document was already marked prohibited from a previous clause, then do not call score (BS2 could do this as well)\n\n\n\nI don't think I'll have near-term time to dig on this so feel free to take it if you are inspired!",
