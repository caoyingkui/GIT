    "description": "In our use case, we have custom query types (both SpanQuery and non-SpanQuery) which are not provided by Lucene. UnifiedHighlighter needs extension points to handle some custom query types in order for highlighting to be accurate. This issue represents adding two extension point methods to support custom query types.",
