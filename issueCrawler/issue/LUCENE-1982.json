As a result of the suspected problem,   only 1/60 (Math.PI/180)  number of the boxes can be created.  \n\nI would very appreciate it if someone can take a look. In fact,  I have a few more questions about Lucene spatial.  Please feel free to contact me\nat yankang.jiang@gmail.com\n\nThanks.\n\nYankang",
