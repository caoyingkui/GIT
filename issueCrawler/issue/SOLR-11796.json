    "description": "Currently Solr's probability distributions have fixed parameters. This ticket will allow the probability distributions to be parameterized by other probability distributions. This will support Bayesian prior distributions and Bayesian networks. \n\nThis is a fairly large piece of work because it involves retrofitting all the existing distribution functions and will be the center piece of the statistical work for Solr 7.3.",
