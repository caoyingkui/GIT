    "description": "When using an external file field (containing, say, reads), values in the field can be returned using &fl=field(reads), yielding something like:\n\n{\"response\":{\"numFound\":...,\"start\":0,\"maxScore\":1.0,\"docs\":[\n{\"field(reads)\":0.0}\n]}}\n\n\nIn the response, the field can be renamed to, say, views like this: &fl=views:field(reads), yielding something like:\n\n{\"response\":{\"numFound\":...,\"start\":0,\"maxScore\":1.0,\"docs\":[\n{\"views\":0.0}\n]}}\n\nIf, in this case, the field is renamed to reads: &fl=reads:field(reads), the result is now:\n\n{\"response\":{\"numFound\":...,\"start\":0,\"maxScore\":1.0,\"docs\":[\n{\"reads\":[0.0]}\n]}}\n\n(the 0.0 reads are now encapsulated in a list). \n\nThe same problem does not occur in the XML response writer.",
