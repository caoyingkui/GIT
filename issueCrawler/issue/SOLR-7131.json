    "description": "Solr group supports asc and desc on some field:\nlet's take sort=time asc as an example\nIn asc mode: groups are sorted by the min value in the group, \nIn desc mode, groups are sorted by the max value in the group.\n\nBut users may want more:\nin asc_max mode, sort group by max(not min) value in the group\n==> this should be a common requirement.\nVice verse, in desc_min mode, sort group by min(not max) value in th group.\n\nWe have this requirement in our product, and we implemented in some cumbersome way: by create a new kind of FieldComparator: LongAbnormalComparator\n\nIt would be great Solr can support this.",
