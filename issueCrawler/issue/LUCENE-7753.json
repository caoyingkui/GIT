            "content": "Thank you for your review Adrien Grand; I modified the source .jj file for queryParser as well. I noticed that the jj files are not in sync with the generated files - there are some extra unused imports; I did not fix these.\nThe new patch renames final fields to uppercase and removes changes to egothor. Also apparently IDEA decided to remove some unused imports from one of the files, I left that in the patch. Let me know if that's OK. ",
