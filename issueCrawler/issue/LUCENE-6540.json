    "description": "LUCENE-6532 adds the supporting mathematics for point-distance computation based on the ellipsoid (using Vincenty's Direct and Inverse solutions). This feature adds BKDPointDistance query function to LUCENE-6477 for finding all documents that match the provided distance criteria from a given geo point.  This should out perform other solutions since we can stop traversing the BKD tree once we've found an internal node that matches the given criteria.",
