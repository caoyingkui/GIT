If this option is set to true an implementation will choose performance over RAM. In the case that an implementation uses SimpleText this option wouldn't have an influence, but for packed integers it would have an influence.\n\nMaybe we should have IndexDocValuesConfig class for DV based settings.

For solr users etc, thats something they can tweak in the xml on a per-implementation basis just like when they provide crazy parameters to various tokenfilters in their analysis chain. ",
