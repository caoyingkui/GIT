HLL accuracy depends on having good (long) hash values \u2013 these can be computed at query time, but we should give users a simple option to compute them at index time for efficiency (especially with things like String hashing)",

If we can index the hash value for a routing key, shard splitting can automatically compute hash ranges such that the documents are evenly distributed. But apart from what you've mentioned, it'd need to extract the routing key from a composite id. ",
