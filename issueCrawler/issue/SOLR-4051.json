    "description": "DIH Writes the last modified date to a Properties file using the default locale.  This gets sent in plaintext to the database at the next delta update.  DIH does not use prepared statements but just puts the date in an SQL Statement in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format.  It would probably be best to always format this date in JDBC escape syntax (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/statement.html#999472) and java.sql.Timestamp#toString().  To do this, we'd need to parse the user's query and remove the single quotes likely there (and now the quotes would be optional and undesired).  \n\nIt might just be simpler to change the SimpleDateFormat to use the root locale as this appears to be the original intent here anyhow.  Affected locales include ja_JP_JP , hi_IN , th_TH",

            "content": "This also fixes SOLR-1970 & SOLR-2658, allowing configurable locale, dateformat, filename and location.  It needs a new test and validation.\n\nThis adds a <propertyWriter /> as an element in data-config.xml that allows the user to specify an implementation of interface DIHPropertiesWriter.  This interface was introduced in 3.6 and should have been marked as \"lucene.experimental\".  This patch changes this interface and adds the experimental annotation also, just in case it needs to change again.\n\nAllowing pluggable property writers should open the door to easily solve issues like SOLR-3365.
