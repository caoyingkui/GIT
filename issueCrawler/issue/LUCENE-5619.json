We've decided that in order to use updatable DocValues, you need to index with 4.6+, or re-create the index if it was created with earlier versions. More so, old formats' consumers aren't shipped w/ Lucene anyway.\n\nI'll look into adding those indexes to TestBackCompat \u2013 recreate them w/ few numeric and binary doc-values and then try to update them with newer code.

To test it, simply drop it under lucene/core/src/test/o.a.l/index/.\n\nI am not sure if I should create similar indexes for 4.6 (when NDV capability was added), or it's enough to have only 4.8 for now?
