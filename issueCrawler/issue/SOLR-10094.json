    "description": "This bug only occurs in master, and was likely introduced with the new doc values iterator API which is slated for 7.0.\n\nThis bug was not caught by tests because there are no tests that have a large enough result set to catch the issue. As part of this ticket a test with a large enough result set will be added to reproduce the bug.",

It appears that with each pass over the result set we first need to reset the pointers for each docValues segment. This is consistent with the bug I'm seeing which is the first set of results are sorted properly but then things go haywire with the sort.  ",
