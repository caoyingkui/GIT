    "description": "We have got three solr instances and two collections which are replicated twice. So each solr instance has all the data available. \n\nThe current implementation of CloudSolrServer has 6 slices in my setup but the end result is 3 urls which are passed to the load balancer. \n\nI think the problem is on the first line of the following code:\n\n\n \nif (nodes.put(node, nodeProps) == null) {\n  if (!sendToLeaders || (sendToLeaders && coreNodeProps.isLeader())) {\n    String url = coreNodeProps.getCoreUrl();\n    urlList2.add(url);\n  } else if (sendToLeaders) {\n    String url = coreNodeProps.getCoreUrl();\n    replicas.add(url);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe precondition of this code is that a node can contain one collection, which is not true. Urls are only added when the hashmap 'nodes' does not already contain the node.",
