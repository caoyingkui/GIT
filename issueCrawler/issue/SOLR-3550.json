    "description": "The issue occurs when users copy Solr's example \"solr home\" directory somewhere else, not relative to Solr's installation and paths break.  Paths like these:\n\n\n<lib dir=\"../../dist/\" regex=\"apache-solr-cell-\\d.*\\.jar\" />\n<lib dir=\"../../contrib/extraction/lib\" regex=\".*\\.jar\" />\n\n\n\nI've addressed this in my own projects by introducing a new system property construct like dir=\"${solr.install.dir}/contrib/extraction/lib\".  But this requires a change to solrconfig.xml for every <lib> element.  There's got to be a better way such that Solr can be installed in one place, and <lib> directives can readily access the Solr \"installation\" directory path.",
