Also, even though this is an example, a.pdf does not exist, but we do have solr-word.pdf now.\n\nSo, this should probably say:\n\njava -Durl=http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/update/extract -Dparams=literal.id=pdf1 -Dtype=application/pdf -jar post.jar solr-word.pdf\n\nAlso, it is worth mentioning (if true) that specifying -Durl overrides -Dc.",
