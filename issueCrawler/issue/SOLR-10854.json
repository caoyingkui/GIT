(And anyway, it's not currently supported in the PDF output, so that's really just for the future for now.)\n\nThere is another syntax that is supported which might explain it a bit, but I thought that might be less clear what it was for, which is like this:\n\n\n= Title of Document\nauthorName <email>\n\n\n\nAs a \"field\" it's called the \"author email\", even though it supports website URLs. So, since that's what it's called, if you want to declare it with an attribute you have to use :email:. This is explained here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#author-and-email. That doc doesn't say it supports website URLs, but it does.\n\nThe reason I put it there is so when asciidoctor-pdf has support for it, the website URL will appear on the title page without us having to remember to put it in there later.
