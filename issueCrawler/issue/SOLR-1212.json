Hence useful in those cases.",

But from Solr's perspective it is not needed and therefore I don't see why we should ship it at all. It is a class that is not used by Solr but would need to be maintained by us if we ship it. "

            "content": "@Shalin , @HossMan - I understand the pain of maintaining this one separate from Junit - but was concerned mostly about this being out of date with the tree. \n\nAs regarding comparison between TestNG vs JUnit - one big advantage is to categorize the tests as different groups in testng and run them separately (especially useful as the code base of solr gets bigger + contrib ). Which is one of the primary reasons (After evaluating both ) - testng was chosen.  So  - if you guys are not comfortable with the patch - then (as shalin noted) - just make an entry in the wiki and leave this one as such. The code is definitely not big to warrant a sf project / github / google code at this point. \n\nA better patch would be to refactor existing JUnit Test case so that the testng version minimizes duplication as much as possible.
