            "content": "More information:\n\n\nWhen running the script:   two issues immediately show themselves.   \n\n1)   The JAVA_MINOR_VERSION is parsed from the VM and does not produce the values that the script needs on about line 1324.\n2)    The $delay that is passed to the sleep method is initialized as a 0.5 float.  AIX sleep gives an invalid argument message when using less than 1.\n\nIf I modify the scripts to use delay=1  and I set JAVA_MINOR_VERSION manually,  then the script writes the pid file and completes.   The only issue is that the process dies.\nIf you review the solr console log you find:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n\n<verbosegc xmlns=\"http://www.ibm.com/j9/verbosegc\" version=\"R26_Java726_SR3_20121024_1635_B126071\">\n\nJVMJ9VM007E Command-line option unrecognised: -Xloggc:/opt/esolr/solr-5.2.1/server/logs/solr_gc.log\n</verbosegc>\n\nError: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.\nError: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.\n\nIf I remove the Xloggc from the command line. Solr does start up.\n ",
