If it's included, how did you create the cores that are using it?\n\nThaiWordFilterFactory has a replacement, mentioned in the javadoc for that class.  It looks like it must be used as the tokenizer now.  My personal opinion here is that this removes a lot of flexibility from the schema ... tokenizers can be useful, but when functionality is rolled into a tokenizer, that tokenizer may do other things that you do not want to happen for a particular field.\n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/core/5_0_0/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/th/ThaiWordFilterFactory.html\n\nThe other message indicates that your config contains a section for loading the AdminHandlers.  This is now done automatically by the source code, you do not need to have it in your config. ",

Even though we do try to make sure all our examples are up to date, some of the less-commonly used examples do not receive the attention they need.\n\nLooking in branch_5x code, it appears that the example-DIH configs include both of these deprecated items.  They are also present in morphlines-core test-files configs.\n\nAdminHandlers is also present in a number of test-files configs for both core and solrj.\n\nThey do not appear in trunk, which makes sense because these deprecated classes are entirely removed there.

You can use them if you must, but the warning is displayed, because anything that is deprecated will be removed in the next major release.\n\nIn trunk, which is version 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT, these classes have been entirely removed, as I just described.  The trunk configs are\n\nI think we can remove /get, /update, and /admin/ from all the configs, plus the ThaiWordFilterFactory from all the schemas, but in at least some of the examples, /replication has comments showing how to set up master/slave replication.  We should make sure that a defined replication handler will override the built in one.  I remember seeing something about a defined /update handler with an update processor chain not overriding the built-in handler. ",
