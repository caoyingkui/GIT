    "description": "Half of the current managed-schema includes lot of configuration that is un-used by many people and is somewhat painful to remove.\n\nThis includes the files present in the lang folder mostly - around 500 lines out of the 1000-line file are configuring so many different languages and other stuff in lang folder that is never used.\n\nIt might be good to consider splitting the managed-schema file into two:\n\n\tmanaged-schema: Everything but the lang folder config\n\tdependency-schema: lang folder config and other things that relate to other files.\n\n\n\nIf dependency-schema is absent, Solr will just assume that it is not required.\n\n\tThis makes it easy to get rid of the extra config and ~100 files that are not required to be stored in zookeeper.\n\tThe managed-schema file becomes easier to look at.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance: This should also reduce a lot of pressure on zookeeper because with all those un-necessary files gone, no replica will download them ever",
