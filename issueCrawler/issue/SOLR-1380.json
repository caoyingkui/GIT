Let me know if I can help with incorporating it into the trunk (don't have commit access, but if issues come up, I can help debug).\n\nI def. agree that the near copy/paste is not a great solution.  In my opinion, the Stats and Facet components should be integrated, this would provide an easy way to remove that and other redundancies, as well as allow for added functionality.  What do you think?

            "content": "Noticed that distributed search was crashing for me in the StatsComponent.  I believe this is related to the fuzziness around when the returned stats values should be null for a field.  I'm submitting a small patch which fixes the bug, and always returns null for stats values for which the count is equal to zero in both distributed and non-distributed search.  My rationale behind this is that when the count is equal to zero, the min/max/mean values reported are garbage and should not be relied on as valid statistics for the field.  Hopefully this can still be incorporated into the trunk before the 1.4 release. "
