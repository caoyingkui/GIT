    "description": "The update log replay sends commit commands directly with the Update Handler.\nThe update processor chain is not used. I may be wrong but I think this is to prevent to log this commit command again in the LogUpdateProcessor.\n\nBut this commit command is flagged with the flag UpdateCommand.REPLAY. I think this flag should be checked in the LogUpdateProcessor in order to adapt its behavior.\n\nCurrently, commit actions in custom Update Processors are not applied in case of a crash without an explicit commit.\nA workaround can be done with the finish function but this is not ideal.",
