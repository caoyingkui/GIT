    "description": "I thought I'd just mention that java.util.UUID supports parsing of strings\ncontaining UUIDs while still choking on anything UUID-like or simply plain wrong,\nas seen in attached patch and unittests. It won't accept Windows GUIDs with curly\nbrackets \n{12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678}\n, but then again, neither did the previous \ncode. Perhaps it should though?  Considering that it will fail when someone \nstarts pulling data directly from MSSQL (http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DataImportHandler)?",
