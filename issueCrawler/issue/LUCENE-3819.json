I find the latest JIRA and email displays are hard to read, tend to format badly, and don't offer much value.\n\nI'd like to remove them and just leave svn commits and twitter mentions (which are much easier to read and format better).

Perhaps \"Downloads\", \"Common Downloads\" or \"Download Shortcuts\" makes sense?\n\nAlternatively, we could put download buttons for Lucene Core and Solr in the sidebar. If we follow this approach perhaps we might want to move the buttons to the sidebar for the Lucene Core and Solr page as well.\n\nTo sum up, I'm proposing:\n\n\n\tWe rename \"User Resources\" to \"Projects\" as you suggested (on the top page)\n\tWe add two download buttons for Solr and Lucene to the sidebar (on the top page)\n\tWe move the download button to the sidebar on the Lucene Core and Solr pages.\n\n\n\n(Lucene gets a green button and Solr gets an orange button on the relevant pages.)\n\nThoughts?
