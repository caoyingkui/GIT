    "description": "In exploring alternative and perhaps faster ways to implement the\ndeleted documents functionality, the idea of filtering the deleted\ndocuments at a higher level came up. This system would save on\nchecking the deleted docs BitVector of each doc read from the posting\nlist by SegmentTermDocs. This is equivalent to an AND NOT deleted\ndocs query.\n\nIf the patch improves the speed of indexes with delete documents,\nmany core unit tests will need to change, or alternatively the\nfunctionality provided by this patch can be an IndexReader option.\n\nI'm thinking the first implementation will be a Filter in\nIndexSearcher.",
