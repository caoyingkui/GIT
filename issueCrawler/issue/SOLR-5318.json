I changed Oliver's approach a bit so we don't need new methods in CoreContainer.\n\nI'm not quite sure we really need all the variants of register, it seems like we always have things like the core name, whether the core is transient, all that stuff already in the CoreDescriptor we pass around, except maybe in the case of renaming the core. Could all this be made simpler? But that's for another day. "
