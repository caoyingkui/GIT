I tried to make changes accordingly to your suggestions: \n\n\tdefault parser for rq is ReRankQParser\n\treRankQuery local param is deprecated in favour of using v\n\tquery is parsed using subQuery()\n\n\n\nI duplicated rerank tests so they use simplified syntax as well. If you have any suggestions, I'm more than happy to hear them. \n\nCheers, \nMaciej "
