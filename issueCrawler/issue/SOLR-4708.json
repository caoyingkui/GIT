    "description": "In the past, the ClusteringComponent used to rely on 3rd party JARs not available from a Solr distro.  This is no longer the case, but the /browse UI and other references still had the clustering component disabled in the example with an awkward system property way to enable it.  Let's remove all of that unnecessary stuff and just enable it as it works out of the box now.",

The uima tests that have the clustering component defined (but disabled by default) fail when this is automatically enabled, so.  \"copying example\" should also imply including all the contrib's that are depended upon (even if lazily), but we know that's not how folks do it.  Well, ok, I defer this to another day after the example + contribs situation is made better (having a solr.install.dir reference for the contrib libs would do it, I think, IMO). "
