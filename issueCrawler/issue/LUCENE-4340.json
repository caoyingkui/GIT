We can use ivy configuration for the dependency.\n\nI also think \"concrete\" things not used by 4.0 codec like VariableGapTerms/BlockTermsWriter etc should go to the module,\ne.g. underneath packages like blockterms/. But some trickiness here: test-framework uses some of this stuff (e.g. Lucene40WithOrds, NestedPulsing, etc).\n\nSo we have to figure out how to also support these test-only codecs somehow (maybe also RandomCodec so we don't have to do a lot of craziness\nto pass random parameters to these other codecs).
