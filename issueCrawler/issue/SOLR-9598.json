    "description": "As part of the RESTORE operation, Solr creates a new collection and adds necessary number of replicas to each shard. The problem is that this operation doesn't wait for this new collection to be fully ready for usage (e.g. querying and indexing). This requires extra checks on the client side to make sure that the recovery is complete and reflected in cluster status stored in Zookeeper. e.g. refer to the backup/restore unit test for this check,\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/722e82712435ecf46c9868137d885484152f749b/solr/core/src/test/org/apache/solr/cloud/AbstractCloudBackupRestoreTestCase.java#L234\n\nIdeally this check should be implemented in the RESTORE operation itself.",
