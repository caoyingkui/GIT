    "description": "QuickScorer is an algorithm which can calculate multiple additive trees fast by using bitvectors for detecting target leaves.\nIt was first published in SIGIR 2015 and won the best paper award of the conference.\nrefs: http://zola.di.unipi.it/rossano/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/sigir15.pdf\n\nWe implemented QuickScorer as one of LTRScoringModel.\nThis model uses same configuration of MultipleAdditiveTreesModel, thus it is easy to replace the model.\nOur experiments show our model can calculate scores about twice faster than MultipleAdditiveTreesModel.",
