    "description": "Recent SolrJ changes (SOLR-8097) resulted in SolrClient ending up with protected ctors.  This achieved the purpose at the time, and steered consumers towards using the *Builder types.  However the change was overly restrictive, as this visibility prevents consumers from extending SolrClient in any meaningful way.\n\nThis issue involves changing the visibility of the SolrClient \"kitchen sink\" ctors to better support extension.\n\n(See recent discussion on SOLR-8097 for more discussion on this topic.)",
