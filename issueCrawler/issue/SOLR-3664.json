            "content": "Theses are the two areas i know about in which solr has indirect dependencies on third party packages via lucene modules:\n\n\n\tsolr/contrib/uima - depends on:\n\t\n\t\tlucene/analysis/uima - depends on:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t... various uima jars\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t...some other uima jars that lucene/analysis/uima doesn't use\n\t\n\t\n\tsolr/contrib/analysis-extras - depends on:\n\t\n\t\tlucene/analysis/icu - depends on:\n\t\t\n\t\t\ticu4j\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tlucene/analysis/smartcn\n\t\tlucene/analysis/morfologik - depends on:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t... various morfologik jars\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t...etc\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n(Note: currently these situations are both in solr contribs, but the potential problem moving forward could also occur in solr/core in the future)\n\nAs noted in SOLR-3623, the key reason for this redundancy (as opposed to just referencing these third party jars in the build.xml the same way we do for lucene jars) is to ensure that both the third-party jar files, and their licenses make it into the Solr binary release artifacts.\n\nMy initial thought for addressing this was to try and keep things in sync automatically by specifying that if a solr contrib depends on a lucene module, it should override the \"resolve\" target to copy the ivy.xml from the lucene module, and then delegate to the default \"resolve\" target \u2013 that way everything would automatically be in sync.  But then I realized that it would really help in either of the existing situations, where there are multiple lucene modules whose ivy.xml files would need to be \"merged\" (analysis-extras), of extra dependencies would need to be added (uima)\n\nSo my current straw man suggestion is this: Solr contribs should continue to list the third party package dependencies in thier ivy.xml files (redundantly) but we should remove the corresponding LICENSE/NOTICE/sha1 files from svn and instead override the \"resolve\" target to copy all txt/sha1 files from the lucene modules they depend on.  \n\nThis wouldn't give us any automated updating of ivy.xml, but any committer who adds/modifies the dependencies of a lucene module w/o knowing/remembering that there is a solr ivy.xml files that also needs updated should get a failure when running \"ant clean-jars validate\"\n\nIt wouldn't be an ideal solution, but it would at least prevent us from introducing inconsistencies.\n\n(I'm hoping someone else has a better solution) "
