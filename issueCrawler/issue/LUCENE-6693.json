    "description": "Since I updated Groovy and other tools, 5.x builds fail with permgen errors in Jenkins. During the build, Groovy (which is large) is loaded three times and this sums up.\n\nSee Revision: 1692103\n\nI reverted the Groovy update in 5.x for now. The fix is to make the top-level build.xml also load common-build.xml and resolve groovy before the build starts.",

Unfortunately it still lists the duplicates under \"common.\" but thats the same for all other modules.\n\n\n\nI ran several tasks without problems (including jenkins-hourly). "
