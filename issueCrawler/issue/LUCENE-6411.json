    "description": "Currently Spans needed a lot of asserts in every Spans to make it possibly to debug things. If you miss a single assert, bugs are hidden or not narrowed down the problematic Spans class. \n\nInstead I think it would be better if we made a test-framework/AssertingSpansQuery that wrapped another SpanQuery and added all the checks. We could use it to really improve the debuggability and coverage of tests.",

It makes it easy to find bugs in two-phase iteration and stuff like that (necessary to really debug them at all). \n\nMaybe we can improve it and use it in other places, but for now its a start. "
