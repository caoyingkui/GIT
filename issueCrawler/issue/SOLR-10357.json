            "content": "Patch implementing the idea.  \n\nThere remains an issue: the original auto-gen use case (for e.g. wifi => wi fi, replacing a single token with multiple tokens, but no overlapping terms) still doesn't auto-generate a phrase query for wi fi if synonyms are replaced rather than expanded when  QueryBuilder.autoGenerateMultiTermSynonymsQuery is set to true.  So this is not (yet) a complete solution.  IMHO this is a weakness of how QueryBuilder decides whether to invoke \"graph\" processing, currently only when a posLength > 1 is encountered (as when there are overlapping multi-word synonyms).\n\nThis patch changes the test schema named schema12.xml to use the graph-aware versions of the synonym and word delimiter filters.  Instead of committing as-is (pending full testing and precommit, not yet done), I'll do the rote schema conversions on SOLR-10343 and SOLR-10344 and set those as blockers of this issue; that seems like a more appropriate way to handle whatever conflicts might come up from other uses of schema12.xml.
