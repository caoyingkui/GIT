    "description": "How to reproduce\n\nTry to inherit from MMapDirectory to change the openInput logic (open files from different directories).\n\nExpected result:\n\nInherit from MMapDirectory, overwrite the one method, done.\n\nActual result:\n\nIt's impossible to overwrite the method as the inner classes would be missing. It's impossible to fork the inner classes as they depend on a final method with default visibility (cleanMapping).\nIt turns out to be the easiest option to completely for the code and replace just the method in question.\n\nPossible fix:\n\nChange the visibility of most members and subtypes to be at least protected and avoid the default visibility.",

I've seen few people trying this for real, and even fewer succeeding. ",

A set of MMapDirectories + delegation might help here.\n\nBut it would still be nice if MMapDirectory would either be final or extension safe. Or if the implicit no-exension policy of openInput would be made explicit with a final tag. ",
