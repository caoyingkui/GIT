    "description": "Often, a multivalued field is used as a set of values. Since multivalued fields are more like lists than sets, users do two consecutive operations, remove and add, to insert an element into the field and also maintain the set's property of only having unique elements.\n\nProposing a new single operation, called \"add-distinct\" (which essentially means \"add-if-doesn't exist\") for this.",

I also believe this will be a very wealthy addition in atomic requests as users have to parse the SET from the list on their application code today.\n\nDesign: if field not present, do conventional \"add\" atomic operation or else:\n              if passed values are list, check each value present already and then add\n              else if singular, check value present already and then add\n\nIncluded small test to verify that. Looking forward to your review and feedback. ",
