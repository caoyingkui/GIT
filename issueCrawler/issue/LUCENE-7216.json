    "description": "Construction of GeoPolygons through GeoPolygonFactory.makeGeoPolygon() takes O(N^2) time, where N is the number of points.  This is due to the non-transitive nature of edge/point comparisons in Geo3D; just knowing that the next point is on the right side of an edge doesn't tell you anything about previous edges.  Still, maybe there is a 2D algorithm somewhere that can be adapted to run in O(N) time.",
