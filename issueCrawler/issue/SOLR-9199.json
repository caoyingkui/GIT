    "description": "The following logic introduced as part of SOLR-8720 is inefficient. \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/6c0331b8309603eaaf14b6677afba5ffe99f16a3/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cloud/ZkController.java#L687-L712\n\nSpecifically,\n\n\n\tfoundStates flag is set to TRUE before the for loop.\n\tIn the for loop we check if any replica on this node is not in the DOWN state. If yes, then foundStates = FALSE\n\tIf foundStates == TRUE then we break out of the loop and return.\n\n\n\nThe problem here is that once foundStates is set to FALSE, it is never reset to TRUE. Hence we end up spending the whole 60 secs iterating over the collections even though all the replicas are marked as DOWN in later iterations.",
