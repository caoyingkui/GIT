Example of restoring via upload using SolrJ:\n\n    ContentStreamUpdateRequest restoreReq = new ContentStreamUpdateRequest(\"/replication\");\n    restoreReq.setParam(\"command\", ReplicationHandler.CMD_RESTORE);\n    files = tmpBackupDir.listFiles();\n    haveFiles = false;\n    if (files != null) {\n        for (File f : files) {\n            if (f != null && f.getName() != null && f.exists()\n                    && f.length() > 0) {\n                haveFiles = true;\n                restoreReq.addFile(f, \"application/octet-stream\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n ",
