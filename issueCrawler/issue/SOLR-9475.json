(ala CentOS apparently)\n\n(ie: we should not try the sketchy/risky stuff first, just because it's more likely we'll get a match.  we should test the stuff that's more well defined and well structured first, even if we know there are many systems where the command might exist but may not give us useful info)\n\n ",

That is a nice structured file, and all we need is the NAME= line. So I have done one change to one line and I think we're good:\n\n\n- proc_version=`cat /etc/*-release 2>/dev/null`\n+ proc_version=$(grep -E \"^NAME=\" /etc/os-release 2>/dev/null)\n\n\n\nI tested this change across a number of distros by extracting the detection code into a script distro.sh and then running this command\n\n\nfor os in ubuntu debian centos opensuse gidikern/rhel-oracle-jre; do echo \"Testing on $os:\" && docker run -it -v `pwd`/distro.sh:/tmp/distro.sh $os bash /tmp/distro.sh ; done\nTesting on ubuntu:\nContents of variable 'proc_version' before matching: NAME=\"Ubuntu\"\nContents of variable 'distro' after matching: Ubuntu\nTesting on debian:\nContents of variable 'proc_version' before matching: NAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux\"\nContents of variable 'distro' after matching: Debian\nTesting on centos:\nContents of variable 'proc_version' before matching: NAME=\"CentOS Linux\"\nContents of variable 'distro' after matching: CentOS\nTesting on opensuse:\nContents of variable 'proc_version' before matching: NAME=\"openSUSE Leap\"\nContents of variable 'distro' after matching: SUSE\nTesting on gidikern/rhel-oracle-jre:\nContents of variable 'proc_version' before matching: NAME=\"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server\"\nContents of variable 'distro' after matching: RedHat\n\n\n\nRegarding lsb_release -i it finds info from /etc/lsb-release which, at least for common docker images, does not exist for the majority of distros. And the main reason why I'm checking /etc/os-release before {(/proc/version}} or uname -a is that in virtualized envs the latter two tend to print the docker VM's OS instead of the container's OS. So with the etc/os-release approach, we behave nicely in both cases.\n\nSo if no objections I'll commit the one-line change outlined above. ",
