    "description": "MacroExpander class was updated to allow to return null when replacement parameters are missing. Right now it defaults to a blank space and it isn't easily verifiable that a parameter was missing. Additionally, unit tests were added for this case and the original use cases of Macro Expander.",

What do you think?\n\nMacroExpander:\n\n\tparam/member spell correction\n\tmake the new flag final\n\tconstructor style tweak\n\n\n\nTestMacroExpander:\n\n\tassertEquals arg order needed swapping\n\tsplit out the tests:\n\t\n\t\ttestExamples via its random element tests and shows that existing/example behavior is unaffected by absence or presence or value of the new parameter\n\t\ttestOnMissingParams tests the expansion behavior differences, with coverage expanded (no pun intended) so that either or both of the params could be missing\n\t\n\t\n\n ",
