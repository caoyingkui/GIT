            "content": "Patch, that just sends the output to a temp file, and on failure streams it back...\n\nBut one backside to this approach is ... it can alter the test's behavior since the thread interrupts can now arrive while IW is printing to the infoStream, change the timing of IW's operations, etc. ...\n\nI wanted to do this originally because when this test fails, it's very hard to repro, and the failure log can tell us details about what happened, but right now some details are missing such as when MDW's virus checker kicked in to prevent certain file deletions.  Ideally we would also get MDW's confessions into the log ... but that would mean setting an infoStream on MDW which is scary to me. ",
