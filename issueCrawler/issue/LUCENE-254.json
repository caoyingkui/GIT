    "description": "Hi,\n\nA while back I wrote some code to implement automatic query expansion in Lucene.\nNow I ripped off the application specifics and put it in more or less \"test-case\nstyle\" in the attachment. Apart from the sources and classes, it contains a tiny\nindex consisting of sample data I got from the Lucene FAQ. Almost too small to\nbe meaningful, but with the sample query you'll get at least a different number\nof hits.\n\nI made some arbitrary decisions on where to put the classes. Mainly they ended\nup in the lucenesandbox-package and should have unique names, hence not\noverwriting anything.\n\nThe comments in the source were chiefly written to illustrate the flow to\nnot-so-experienced Lucene users/java programmers. You might find self-evident\nwhat they describe.\n\nPlease refer to the \"quick start\" section in the readme file to get\nthings going (should be really quick).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, I'll appreciate your feedback. \n\nBest regards,\n\nRene Hackl",
