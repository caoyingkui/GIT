    "description": "When calling Collections API's MOVEREPLICA, the new replica created is always NRT type, even when the original replica is PULL or TLOG. As discussed on IRC, it should use the source replica type, or provide a parameter for the user to choose the new replica's type, similar to ADDREPLICA <type> parameter.",

When the user's request explicitly asks for a type, that would of course take precedence over both of these settings. ",

            "content": "Shawn:\n\nI would think that the original proposal of \"use the source replica's type or an explicit override\" is best for MOVEREPLICA.\n\nFor other kinds of operations, <2> is confusing to me.\u00a0ADDREPLICA already has a \"type\" you can specify that defaults to NRT. What other operations do you think need this? At any rate the general approach of \"use NRT unless there's a 'type' override\" seems like the right thing to do.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 ",

            "content": "In general, I completely agree that MOVEREPLICA should preserve the replica type that already exists.\n\nBut when I was thinking about the idea where somebody could specify a default replica type, I wondered if some people might want that to override what things like MOVEREPLICA do by default.  I'm not sure that such an option should be implemented, but I did think of it.\n\nGilson also noticed that UTILIZENODE created NRT replicas.  Which might really be the same problem \u2013 it would be reasonable for UTILIZENODE to be implemented internally as MOVEREPLICA. ",
