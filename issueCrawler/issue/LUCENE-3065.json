See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1701?focusedCommentId=12721972&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12721972\n\nWe have spare bits already in stored fields, so, we should use one to record that the field is numeric, and then encode the numeric field in Solr's more-compact binary format.\n\nA nice side-effect is we fix the long standing issue that you don't get a NumericField back when loading your document.",

Maybe we should reserve 3 bits instead of 2 for the numeric field type - so 0x70 instead of 0x30 as mask? I just want to reseve this one extra bit, so we dont need to do any dumb masks and values later, if we extend.\n\nAbout the index format change:\nAs described above, for Solr it's not a problem. New fields are always indexed using NumericField. On the query side, when Document.getField is called, it could simply check the return value with instanceof. If the getter returns not a NumericField, Solr knows that it's binary and can decode manually. This would safe backwards.\n\nElse its no break at all if we support both stored field formats during indexing somehow (in Lucene its string, returning a String Field or new binary NumericField). The index format itsself does not change generally (no need to bump version numbers, as we only use unused bits?) ",

The reason is the implementation of NumericField.stringValue(), it returns what the user is used to from 3.0\n\tIf a user calls getFieldable(field) all is fine, too. The only change is that it could return NumericField now. If the user simply calls stringValue() all is identical to 3.0\n\n\n\nProblems start with:\n\n\n\tIf user calls Document.getField(name) it returns Field (internally it casts the getFieldable()) result to Field. But NumericField does not subclass Field -> ClassCastException.\n\n\n\nHow to handle this?\n\n\n\tMaybe change those methods to return AbstractField, but thats a binary break and users will complain, because not everything works as expected\n\tMake NumericField subclass Field (and Field is unfinalized) - thats a bad idea, because Field has too many methods / members that are out of scope\n\tDeprecate Document.getField() and make it internally do an instanceof check, if it gets NumericField transform to a backwards-compatible Field? - This method is already broken. If you request Lazy field loading it also throws ClassCastEx (e.g. LUCENE-609).\n\n\n\nNot sure how to proceed. Else the patch looks fine. I think simply ignoring LazyField loading is fine, as numeric fields are a maximum of 8 bytes.... Else we would need LazyNumericField  ",
