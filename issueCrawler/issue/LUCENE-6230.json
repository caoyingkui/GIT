    "description": "We now have doclint running on compile/javadoc to find problems. Can we remove some extra linters?\n\nJtidy: this consumes a ton of memory, and doesn't have good error messages. Can we just remove it in trunk at least?\n\nECJ: this is slow, unless we upgrade minimum ant version from 1.8.2 to 1.8.3, then we can make it really not generate .class files, because the javac task has a createMissingPackageInfoClass we can disable. alternatively, we could also remove this checker. I am unsure if its providing anything beyond doclint.",
