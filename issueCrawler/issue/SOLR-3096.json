    "description": "The attached patch modifies the new website design to incorporate the book information.  It ads a header \"mantle\" slideshow entry with both book images (just the 2 current books), and it adds a book page with the 3 books published (this includes the 1st edition that is out of date now).  The image files referenced are the same actual binary images on the current website by I chose a more consistent naming convention.",
