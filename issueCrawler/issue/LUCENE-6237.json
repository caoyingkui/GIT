But in many cases, it seems better to sort secondarily on the minimum frequency.\n\nSee this thread from the users' list: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/alternativeTermCount-and-WordBreakSolrSpellChecker-combination-not-working-tp4185352p4185489.html\n\nAs a follow-on, we should expose this new configuration detail for solr users, possibly making it the default.",
