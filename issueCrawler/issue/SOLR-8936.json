    "description": "The /export handler sorts all results by specified fields as it streams out results. We can use the sort order to perform a reduce style distinct operation as docs are being sent out.\n\nThis can be used in the SQL handler, effectively removing the need for map_reduce mode SELECT DISTINCT operations.\n\nBut the primary driver for this is to export distinct edges during a graph traversal, which will eliminate a huge amount of network traffic during large traversals.",
