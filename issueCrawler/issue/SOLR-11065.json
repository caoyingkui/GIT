    "description": "Currently this class executes operations suggested by the policy sequentially but there is potential for running them in parallel once SOLR-10822 is resolved. This can be massively faster for events such as nodeLost and nodeAdded.\n\nThere should also be some kind of throttling added to ensure that we do not overwhelm the node or the cluster itself. SOLR-8955 can be useful here.",
