    "description": "As we discovered in SOLR-8129, existing update streams can continue to be processed for some time when the CoreContainer is being shut down.  If this node is the leader, updates can continue to flow to replicas over the existing streaming client (although new or idle clients won't be allowed to send anything).\n\nThis can cause large reorders of updates and shard inconsistencies that we can't detect with the current PeerSync mechanism.",

            "content": "I looped the test overnight (adds only) and there were no shard inconsistency type fails.  Although there were plenty of other fails (50 in fact), this is the first time that there was no shard inconsistency.\n\nMark has been testing \"interrupt the update executor on shutdown\" and that also looks like it fixes the issue.  That will also have the effect of stopping other operations more quickly (i.e. requests to other nodes that use that update executor), and in general it seems like a good thing to stop more quickly.  Should that be added here? ",

Technically, it's probably fine since it lives the length of the container, but I think it's best to avoid it for proper shutdown. ",
