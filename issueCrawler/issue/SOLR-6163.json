    "description": "Hey,\n\nI was playing with the ManagedSynonymFilterFactory to create a synonym list with the API. But I have difficulties when my keys contains special characters (or spaces) to delete them...\n\nI added a key \u00e9\u00e9\u00e9 that matches with some other words. It's saved in the synonym file as \u00e9\u00e9\u00e9.\n\nWhen I try to delete it, I do:\n\ncurl -X DELETE \"http://localhost/solr/mycore/schema/analysis/synonyms/english/\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\"\n\nerror message: %C3%A9%C3%A9%C3%A9%C2%B5 not found in /schema/analysis/synonyms/english\n\nA wild guess from me is that %C3%A9 isn't decoded back to \u00e9\u00e9\u00e9. And that's why he can't find the keyword?",
