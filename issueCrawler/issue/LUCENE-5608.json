    "description": "This is a refactor of the SpatialPrefixTree spatial API, in preparation for more SPT implementations on the near horizon.  These are fairly internal APIs; SpatialExample.java didn't have to change, nor the Solr adapters, and I doubt ES would have to either.\n\nAPI changes:\n\n\tSpatialPrefixTree & Cell had a fairly significant make-over. The existing implementations for Geohash & Quad have been made to subclass LegacyPrefixTree & LegacyCell shim's, and otherwise had very few changes (performance should be the same).  Cell is now an interface.\n\tNew CellIterator which is an Iterator<Cell>. Includes 3 implementations.\n\tPrefixTreeStrategy.simplifyIndexedCells was renamed to pruneLeafyBranches and moved to RPT and made toggle'able with a setter. It's going to be removed in the future but for the time being it remains a useful optimization.\n\tRPT's pointsOnly & multiOverlappingIndexedShapes options now have setters.\n\n\n\nFuture:\n\n\tThe AbstractVisitingPrefixTreeFilter (used by RPT's Intersects, Within, Disjoint) really should be refactored to use the new CellIterator API as it will reduce the amount of code and should make the code easier to follow since it would be based on a well-knon design-pattern (an iterator).\n\n\n\nI wish I had done this as a series of commits on a GitHub branch; ah well.",

            "content": "One thing about the API I don't love is that to write an efficient Cell impl, you have to lazy-decode from bytes. This is because the code using the Cell creates Cells sometimes only to check leaf status and/or the level, or maybe to check if it's within (underneath, a suffix of) another cell. Alternatively, there could be some simple methods on SPT like readCellIsBoolean() and readCellLevel(), and have Cell.isPrefixOf() take a BytesRef instead of another Cell.  Ok, a couple simple new methods, but then there is the conundrum of the parameters to abstract methods in AbstractVisitingPrefixTreeFilter like visitLeaf() that take a Cell, which would maybe would be modified to take, what, a BytesRef; and maybe the length and leaf boolean?  That doesn't seem right.  So lazy-decode it is. ",
