    "description": "Hi, \n\n I am new to Solr. I found facets fields does not reflect the original string in the record. For example, \n\nthe returned xml is, \n\n\n\t<doc>\n  <str name=\"g_number\">G-EUPE</str> \n</doc> \n\t<lst name=\"facet_counts\">\n  <lst name=\"facet_queries\" /> \n\t<lst name=\"facet_fields\">\n\t<lst name=\"g_number\">\n  <int name=\"gupe\">1</int> \n</lst> \n  </lst> \n\t<lst name=\"facet_dates\" />\n  </lst> \n\n\n\nHere, \"G-EUPE\" is displayed under facet field as 'gupe' where it is not capital and missing '-' from the original string. Is there any way we could fix this to match the original text in record? Thanks in advance. \n\nRegards, \numa",
