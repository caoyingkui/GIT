It's a little tough to read due to some code indenting but basically I just wrapped a null check around this block of code:\n\n\n      if(scorer != null) {\n        int targetDoc = docID - docBase;\n        int actualDoc = scorer.docID();\n        if (actualDoc < targetDoc) {\n          actualDoc = scorer.advance(targetDoc);\n        }\n\n        if (actualDoc == targetDoc) {\n          // Query did match this doc:\n          hit.score = combine(hit.score, true, scorer.score());\n        } else {\n          // Query did not match this doc:\n          assert actualDoc > targetDoc;\n          hit.score = combine(hit.score, false, 0.0f);\n        }\n      }\n\n\n\nLooks like we need to check for a null scorer on each hit because the segment could change with each hit. I didn't follow through with a combine is this situation as you did on a miss hit, but we could if you want to. ",
