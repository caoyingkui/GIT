I think ideally, this request would go through ZK rather than attempting it directly. The replica would instead just watch the LIR nodes. That is also how I would like to get rid of the 'leader publishes down for replica issue'. We would not really want per update updates to ZK though, so we would probably want some delayed action that collects requests and only talks to ZK once every few seconds or something. ",
