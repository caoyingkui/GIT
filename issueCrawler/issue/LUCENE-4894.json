    "description": "Concurrent Indexing and Search\nThere is no clear explanation regarding those points below.\n1. TaxonomyReader should be reopened after IndexReader.\n2. TaxonomyWriter should be committed before IndexWriter. TaxonomyWriter should be closed before IndexWriter.\nThe rationale is that it's ok to see categories to which no document belongs but not ok the other way around.\nBeginners may not be able to see this until after they think through it for a long time, which most of them including me wouldn't do.\nHowever, facet user guide doesn't explain the rationale clearly.\n\n\n\n\n\tDocumentBuilder & FacetSearchParams.addFacetRequest\nThey no longer exist in lucene 4.2, but they are used in code examples.\n\n\n\n\n\tFacetResultNode.getLabel(TaxonomyReader)\nIt doesn't eixst in 4.2, but it is mentioned in \"Multiple Facet Requests\"\n\n\n\n\n\tETC\nI don't know if there are other points to be made.",

            "content": "The userguide is seriously outdated after all the recent refactoring. I was wondering if we should keep it at all, or rather include a high-level documentation under o.a.l.facet.package.html which covers the basic points, and then focus on maintaining good javadocs at the classes / packages level. It gets harder to maintain these documents ...\n\nNevertheless, if you want to take a crack at improving / fixing it, I will help you get it in. ",

I modified some package.htmls, but I didn't absorb the entire userguide into them because many parts of it were outdated. I'm rather skeptic we'll be able to maintain the jdocs updated in blogs, package.html and java classes. So for now I think we should focus on making sure the classes are well (and accurately) documented. ",
