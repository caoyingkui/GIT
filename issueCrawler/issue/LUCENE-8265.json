    "description": "This will help in cases where some terms containing separator characters should be split, but others should not.  For example, this will enable a filter that identifies things that look like fractions and identifies them as keywords so that 1/2 does not become 12, while doing splitting and joining on terms that look like part numbers containing slashes, eg something like \"sn-999123/1\" might sometimes be written \"sn-999123-1\".",

            "content": "Good point Nikolay Khitrin. While I am having difficulty coming up with an example of something that would be marked as keyword in order to protect it from stemming, but that should be split up by WDF (or conversely something that should be stemmed, but not split), I agree that in principle these are different decisions, and adding an option is low-complexity. I'll post a change later today I hope.\n\nAlan Woodward that idea is really cool, but I think it is more complexity than I want to take on for this issue? I have tried making a wrapping filter before, and it is pretty tricky. In my experience you have to be very careful about (1)  how reset() calls propagate, and (2) the signal to switch behavior.  EG you probably want to be able to call incrementToken() on either of two different upstream filters that both share the same input, based on the value of some attribute. However, by the time you see the attribute, it is already too late to change! So you have to introduce a delay token that only carries this \"switching\" info.  ",

Or perhaps alternatively, some TokenFilters could extend a new TokenFilter subclass that checks a condition.   By default it could be a Predicate that simply returns true.  This would address Mike Sokolov's concern on propagating the lifecycle calls... I've had to delegate a tokenizer/filter before and it was a bit annoying to get right. ",
