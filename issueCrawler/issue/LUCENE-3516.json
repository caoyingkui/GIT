    "description": "We are building Lucene indexes via Hadoop, and using byte[] for of RAMDirectory as intermediate storage. (we are using Hadoop's indexing contrib package)\nCurrently Java serialization is used, and seemed wasteful and not portable across languages.\nSince RAMDirectory essentially is a collection of byte[], writing a serializer seemed easy.\nAttached please find a utility class that does such. This includes a light performance comparison test comparing the java serialization:\n\nResults: (input, number of files and avg file size, output, size percentage: our ser/java ser, time, serialization: percentage, our ser/java ser, deserialization: percentage, our ser/java ser\n\ntest 1:(3, 1k)\nsize: 66.93%\nser time: 1.89%\ndeser time: 4.48%\n\ntest 2: (100,100)\nsize: 95.16%\nser time: 4.01%\ndeser time: 13.36%\n\ntest 3: (3,50k)\nsize: 98.42%\nser time: 3.09%\ndeser time: 8.10%\n\ntest 4: (1,1k)\nsize: 41.70%\nser time: 1.85%\ndser time: 3.85%\n\nThe implementation is very elementary, yet still much better than java ser. Esp on the time (avg 50x faster)",
