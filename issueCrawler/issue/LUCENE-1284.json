    "description": "Set of Java classes that allow the Lucene search engine to use morphological information developed for the Apertium open-source machine translation platform (http://www.apertium.org). Morphological information is used to index new documents and to process smarter queries in which morphological attributes can be used to specify query terms.\n\nThe tool makes use of morphological analyzers and dictionaries developed for the open-source machine translation platform Apertium (http://apertium.org) and, optionally, the part-of-speech taggers developed for it. Currently there are morphological dictionaries available for Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, \nAranese, Romanian, French and English. In addition new dictionaries are being developed for Esperanto, Occitan, Basque, Swedish, Danish, \nWelsh, Polish and Italian, among others; we hope more language pairs to be added to the Apertium machine translation platform in the near future.",

Everything went smooth.\n\nI've only began to look at the code myself, but a couple initial comments:\n\nCould you remove the @author tags? The Lucene project has decided its best to leave them out (you can search the mailing list if you are interested in the discussion).\n\nHow about renaming overview.html to package.html and expanding what you have there? This looks like a very useful addition, but its complicated enough to merit a more thorough overview and/or examples of how to get started. Not everyone wades into the contrib packages that often - lets hook those that do by providing a very clear: \"This is what this is, this is what you can do with it, and here is how you do it\". Nothing too intense, but enough to understand its usefulness quickly (and allow you to gauge the effort required for use).\n\nAs an example of seemingly missing info I am wondering about: where do I get the data files? I see a link to http://www.apertium.org, but digging a bit does not immediately show me what I am looking for. Clear instructions on how to get going with your preferred morphological data files would be great (as well as clear instructions on where and how to obtain those files).\n\nThanks for donating this code! Its something I have been interested in seeing added to Lucene for some time.\n\n\n\tMark\n\n ",

So the Java code you contributed is ASL and Apertium's tools (and data?) is GPL v2?\n\nThe thing that puzzles me are the language pairs themselves.  Why are they in pairs?  Is that simply for the translation part of Apertium, and something that's ignored when you use the pair for Lucene and morphological analysis?\n\nIf I'm interested in, say, French morphological analyzer, why do I need any other language?  For French, I see:\n\n\n\tbr-fr\n\ten-fr\n\tfr-ca\n\tfr-es\n\n\n\nIf I'm interested in French, which of the 4 above is the right one to use?  The one with the highest number of lemmata?\n\nI had a look at the Indexer and Searcher to get an idea about the usage.  Those classes are really just for demonstration, right?  Still, do you mind replacing the deprecated Hits object in the Searcher class?\n\nIn the README you mention this:\n\n2. The Spanish morphological dictionary must be preprocessed in advance to remove multiword expressions:\n\n$ java -classpath lucene-apertium-morph-2.4-dev.jar \\\n  org.apache.lucene.apertium.tools.RemoveMultiWordsFromDix \\\n  --dix apertium-es-ca.es.dix  > apertium-es-ca.es-nomw.dix\n\nCould you explain why the removal of multiword expressions is needed?\nIs that Spanish-specific or something one needs to do regardless of the language?\n\nAlso:\n\n4. Each file to be indexed must be preprocessed using the Apertium tools:\n\n$ cat file.txt | apertium-destxt | lt-proc -a es-ca-nomw.automorf.bin | apertium-tagger -g -f es-ca.prob > file.pos.txt\n\nSo these are a few command-line tools that end up marking up the input text with POS? (I seem to be missing some libraries and can't compile Apterium locally to check what that this marked up file looks like).\nBut my main question here is whether there are Java equivalents of these command-line tools, so that one can easily use them from Java?  Or is one forced to use Runtime.exec(...)?\n\nThanks. ",

If you are not interested in translation (as is our case) you can used whichever language pair containing the language you are interested in; choose the language pair with the highest number of lemmata, probably the one with the highest version number.\n\n> Do you mind replacing the deprecated Hits object in the Searcher class?\n\nWhich is the new class I should use?\n\n> Could you explain why the removal of multiword expressions is needed?\n\nMultiword units need to be removed from the dictionary mainly because they are there to facilitate the correct translation of some expressions to the target language.
