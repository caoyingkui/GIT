            "content": "Thanks for creating this ticket, Noble.\n\nI have an issue with the approach you have mentioned. IMO, the client should specify the \"field\" to which the value belongs to.\nI would rather prefer a format like this -  \n\n@Field(\"*_s\")\npublic Map<String, Object> foo;\n\n\n\nwhere the keys are dynamicField name's. For multivalued fields, a user might specify an Object[] as value. "

            "content": "Adding a patch for this enhancement. \nExisting test cases pass. I'll add new test cases in TestDocumentObjectBinder shortly.\n\nThis is the approach I took.\n\n\tDynamic fields can be annotated in the following manner\n\n@Field(\"*_random\")\npublic Map<String, Integer> random;\n\n@Field(\"supplier_*\")\npublic Map<String, String[]> suppliers;\n\n@Field(\"oem_*\")\npublic Map<String, List<String>> oem;\n\n\n\tBased on the value type of this Map, I populate all matching fields in the response with their corresponding value(s).\n\tI added one more clause to the DocField's storeType method to take care of fields of type Map. Using getActualTypeArguments for this ParameterizedType value, I populate the existing properties in the DocField viz name, field, type, isArray, isList etc.\n\tI added a private method, getFieldValueByFieldName(SolrDocument sdoc, String fieldName) in the DocField class, which is now  being called by the inject method for all fields. For regular index fields, the method behavior has not changed. However, for a dynamic field (as annotated by the client), this method prepares a Map of matching fieldNames and their corresponding value(s). This in turn is used by the inject method to call the client bean's corresponding setter method.\n\n\n\nPlease note that this fix is for version 1.3.\n\nCheers\nAvlesh "
