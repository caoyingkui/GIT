    "description": "The CartesiahShapeFilter could use some improvements.  For starters, if we make sure the boxIds are sorted in index order, this should reduce the cost of seeks.  I think we should also replace the logging with a similar approach to Lucene's output stream.  We also can do Term creation a tad bit more efficiently too.",

            "content": "IMO we should start a refactoring beginning with Shape and CartesianPolyFilterBuilder.\nThis needs Documentation, cleanup and optimization. The Shape List<Double> member bugs me in particular - we could save a lot of object creations when we could change this to an array of doubles where Shapes and their arrays could be reused somehow. \nI have reserved some time to work on spatial in Dec. CartesianPolyFilterBuilder is the place to start from my point of view. ",
