            "content": "This is due to how the multi word synonym is inserted at the same position as the original term, and we have no way to tell whether you match the synonym or the original term since that information is lost after Analysis processing.\n\nThis case would be solved by encoding term positions as a graph in such a way that the synonym node \"domain name system\" would occupy the same position as the original node \"dns\". This however would be a major change. "

            "content": "This is a hard problem to solve (indexing a graph).\n\nWe've made some recent baby steps towards solving it, though: token streams can now include the PositionLengthAttribute, indicating how many positions an \"alternate path\" spans.  SynonymFilter now sets this attribute only in certain cases (when the inserted syn is a single token).  Still, we then drop this attr during indexing...\n\nHandling the case when the inserted syn is multi-word is tricky... I think dns would have to be changed to have posLen=3. "

I am still testing to see if there are any other side effects of that. Do you guys now of any problems with setting the luceneMatchVersion to LUCENE_33. \n\nI will keep an eye on this issue. \n\n\n**The reason why I say it sort of works is that when I search \"name\", in my case dns, domain name search,  it matches with the document which has \"dns\" in its index, that's because I have expand set to true.

            "content": "I think you can fix it by using a \"custom\" synonym filter factory and without setting the \"luceneMatchVersion\" to \"LUCENE_33\" in the solrconfig.xml.\n\nYou can just do something like:\n\npackage your.package.name;\n\npublic class CustomSynonymFilterFactory extends SynonymFilterFactory {\n\n\t@Override\n\t public void init(Map<String,String> args)\n{\n\t\tthis.setLuceneMatchVersion(Version.LUCENE_33);\n\t\tsuper.init(args);\n\t }\n}\n\nAnd then, in your schema, you can do something like this:\n\n<filter class=\"your.package.name.CustomSynonymFilterFactory\" synonyms=\"synonyms.txt\" ignoreCase=\"true\" expand=\"true\"/>\n\nAnd that will let it use the \"SlowSynonymFilter\" from solr 3.3 for just the synonyms without changing the luceneMatchVersion in solrconfig.xml. It works basically by \"tricking\" the SynonymFilterFactory class into thinking the lucene version is 3.3 without it actually being 3.3.\n\nHope that helps out! "
