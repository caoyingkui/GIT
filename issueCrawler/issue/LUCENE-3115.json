When you have a problem with Lucene, please post to the Lucene Java User mailing list first - see http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/mailinglists.html.\n\nAlso, the next time you use JIRA, please make use of the \"Preview\" button below the text entry box, rather than re-editing lots of times.  Every time you submit an edit, a message is sent to the Lucene/Solr developer mailing list.  I have 11 different versions of your issue description clogging up my mailbox...\n\nSteve ",
