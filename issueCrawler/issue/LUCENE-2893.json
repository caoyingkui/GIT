    "description": "we change the index format from time to time, and people tracking trunk have to re-index.\n\nI think we should put a (unsupported, scary) tool in /dev-tools that uses the PreflexRW Codec to\nserialize the index to a 3.0 index (with your old trunk version), you can then deserialize it back \nwith the newer trunk version, to the newest StandardCodec.\n\nthis won't prevent all reindexes, but would work for changes under codec control.\n\nmainly though, I think we could somehow add undeleteAll + this tool + apply deletes to prevent\nthe painful reindexing of luceneutil benchmarking indexes",
