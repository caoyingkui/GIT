    "description": "I've tried to use the SPLITSHARD command from the Solr collection-Api.\nA JUnit test successfully runs before the split, but fails after splitting the shard, stopping and restarting Solr. It won't fail if Solr isn't restarted after splitting.\n\nI found some entries in files \"solr.log\" and \"core.properties\" which may give hints. \n\nAfter split:\norg.apache.solr.update.UpdateLog; Starting to buffer updates. FSUpdateLog{state=ACTIVE, tlog=null\n is logged for both newly created shards in \"solr.log\"\n\n\"clusterstate.json\" from Solr Cloud admin page shows: \nshard1 state: inactive (replica: active)\nshard1_0 state: active parent shard1 (replica active)\nshard1_1 state: active parent shard1 (replica active)\n\nBoth \"core.properties\" files of the newly created shards have\nshardState=construction and shardParent=shard1\nentries.\nThe \"core.properties\" file of the parent shard is not changed.\nWhen restarting Solr\n and running the JUnit again these entries are logged:\norg.apache.solr.update.processor.DistributedUpdateProcessor; Ignoring commit while not ACTIVE - state: BUFFERING replay:0\n in \"solr.log\"\n\nI mainly I followed the steps of this tutorial http://architects.dzone.com/articles/solr-43-shard-splitting-quick. \n\n\t(install solr-4.6.1)\n\tcreate a small cluster:\njava -Dbootstrap_confdir=./solr/portalse/conf -Dcollection.configName=portalse -DzkRun -DnumShards=1 -DmaxShardsPerNode=2 -DreplicationFactor=1 -jar start.jar\n\tRun the unit test (after termination only one document exists).\n\tSplit the only shard:\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=SPLITSHARD&collection=portalse&shard=shard1'\nshard \"collection1_shard1_0_replica1\" created (1 document)\nshard \"collection1_shard1_1_replica1\" created (0 documents)\n\tcommit index:\ncurl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/portalse/update' --data-binary '<commit/>' -H 'Content-type:application/xml'\n\tstop Solr by pressing Ctl-C.\n\trestart Solr:\njava -DzkRun -jar start.jar\n\tRun the unit test from step 2 again.",
