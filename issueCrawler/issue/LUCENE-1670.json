            "content": "I have a couple of comments:\n\n\n\tIn LogMergePolicy, you add a reference to mergeFactor (\n{@link #mergeFactor}\n), which is a private member of LMP. Wouldn't that be an issue when generating the javadocs (i.e., create a link to a non-existent entity, since private members are not generated in the javadocs)?\n\tIn MergePolicy you added a link to SegmentInfo. Same as above - SegmentInfo is package private and therefore I'm not sure its included in the javadocs. If I look here (http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/core/index.html), SegmentInfo does not appear there.\n\tIn IndexWriter, you add references like this: \n{@link #addDocument(Document) addDocument}\n - is the 'addDocument' in the end necessary. I've tried it and it doesn't come out nicely in the javadocs. Same goes for \n{@link #updateDocument(Term, Document) updateDocument}\n.\n\tIn IndexWriter you replaced see <a href=\"#mergePolicy\"> with *see \n{@link #mergePolicy below}\n* - that's wrong for two reasons: (1) mergePolicy is private (see comments above) and (2) the javadocs actually have an element afterwards: <a name=\"mergePolicy\"></a>. The part you replaced references that element, rather than the mergePolicy member (which just happen to have the same name ).\n\n ",

            "content": "Alright, I'll attach a new patch in a couple of minutes that has the following improvements:\n\n\tLogMergePolicy: You are correct. I removed the links, as well as tried rewriting the paragraph to be a little clearer.\n\tMergePolicy: This is not a problem; it does not appear in the API, but it's still linked (hence refactoring tools such as Eclipse will update the link value as well as the class name), and it shows in monospaced font as you'd expect with <code>.\n\tIndexWriter: Re (3), the extra token is the apparent text for the link (in this case, it \"hides\" the parameters). I merely \"translated\" from the previous anchor tag to links.\n\tIndexWriter: Fixed a few typoes\n\tIndexWriter: Reverted the mergePolicy link change\n\tIndexWriter: Fixed missing IndexSearcher import for link\n\n\n ",

Just as a FYI, not everybody use Eclipse, and Eclipse (I think since 3.4) has the ability to update String references to class names you refactor.\n\nThis look good now. Unfortunately, I'm not a committer so I cannot take this issue any further . Hope my review will help the committer that will choose to commit it. ",
