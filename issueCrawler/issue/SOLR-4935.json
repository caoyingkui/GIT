For instance if I specify name=eoe, the instance dir is eoe/, relative to solr home.\n\nThe problem is that the core loading isn't smart enough to do the same default behavior if the instanceDir isn't specified in the <core> tag. One could easily argue that it should be assuming the name is specified, but I'm not all that interested in changing functionality there and dealing with other places such a change might affect things when it's all going away...\n\nBut good point, I'll add a test with the following steps\n1> create 2 cores\n2> check persistence is good\n3> swap one of the new cores with another core\n4> insure persistence is good\n5> rename the other core\n6> insure that persistence is good\n\nIt's probably OK, but there's no test that I know of that actually tries this kind of stuff...\n\n\n "
