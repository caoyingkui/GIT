            "content": "This patch adds protection against points #1 and #3.\n\n\tThe TriggerListener.triggerFired method now returns a boolean. The return value is true if the fire was ready to be processed by the listener otherwise not.\n\tIf the value returned by the above was false then triggers are responsible for maintaining state such that the fire can be attempted again on subsequent executions until the listener returns true.\n\tThe ScheduledTriggers class prevents triggers to be run between the time a previous trigger fire is submitted and it finishes execution\n\tIn case multiple triggers were executing concurrently, it prevents trigger fires from stacking up on the action executor.\n\tAdded javadocs in relevant places to document this behavior and expectations from subclasses of TriggerListener\n\tAdded NodeAddedTriggerTest.testListenerAcceptance() to test this behavior\n\n\n\nTodo\n\n\tAdd similar test for NodeLostTrigger\n\tAdd an integration test for this behavior\n\tAdd rate limiting between action executions (point #2 in description)\n\n\n\nNote that the waitFor implicitly specifies a cooling off period but for the same trigger only. We want another cooling off period between different triggers as well. ",

I'll open another issue for a set-properties autoscaling api.\n\tAdded TriggerIntegrationTest.testTriggerThrottling for testing throttling\n\tAdded NodeLostTriggerTest.testListenerAcceptance for testing that state is maintained if listener is not ready\n\n ",
