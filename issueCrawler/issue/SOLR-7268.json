    "description": "I should be able to pipe JSON/XML/CSV or whatever is possible at the /update/* to a  command which in turn uses SolrJ to send the docs to the correct leader in native format. \nIn the following examples , all connection details of the cluster is put into a file called solrj.properties\nexample :\n\n#post a file\ncat myjson.json | bin/post -c gettingstarted -s http://localhost:8983/solr \n#or a producer program\nmyprogram | bin/post  -c gettingstarted -s http://localhost:8983/solr\n\n\n\nThe behavior of the script would be exactly similar to the behavior if I were to post the request directly to solr to the specified qt . Everything parameter the requesthandler accepts would be accepted as a -<param-name>=<param-value> format. The same things could be put into a properties file called indexer.properties and be passed as a -p parameter. The script would expect the following extra properties zk.url for cloud or solr.url for standalone.",
