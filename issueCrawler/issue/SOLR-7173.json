Sleeping for \"\n              + waitBeforeRetry + \" seconds before re-try ...\");\n          Thread.sleep(waitBeforeRetry * 1000L);\n          sent = sendBatch(batch, waitBeforeRetry, maxRetries);\n        } else {\n          log.error(\"No more retries available! Add batch failed due to: \" + rootCause);\n          throw exc;\n        }\n      }\n    } finally {\n      sendTimerCtxt.stop();\n    }\n\n    batch.clear();\n    return sent;\n  }\n\n ",

However, instead of the recursive approach (through my initial few attempts, couldn't get the tests to pass), I went for an iterative one; do you suggest I go with the recursive approach?\n\nAlso, since I had copied the initial retry logic from HttpPartitionTest's sendDoc(), should I update that code as well with this iterative/recursive retry?
