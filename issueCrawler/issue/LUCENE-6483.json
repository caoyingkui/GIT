    "description": "Core cache keys are typically used for caching, for instance we use them in the query cache and when uninverting.\n\nHowever, since FilterLeafReader delegates addCoreClosedListener by default, these listeners will always be called with the cache key of the wrapper reader. So if you happen to use a filter reader that overrides the core cache key, you are going to try to evict on a different key than the one that you used for caching.\n\nWe should ensure that core closed listeners are always called on the same key as the one returned by #getCoreCacheKey",
