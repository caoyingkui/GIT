    "description": "There is currently no simple way to completely restart Solr 5.x started with \"-e cloud\".  See SOLR-7931 for an example of how this can be a problem.\n\nThe reference guide does explain how to accomplish the restart, but the required commands are non-intuitive for someone who's unfamiliar with the system.\n\nWhen a cloud example is built, I think we should leave some breadcrumbs behind that can be used by a simpler command.  I'm not sure if it should extend the existing \"restart\" command ... a completely correct command would be something like restart-cloud-example.  The \"example\" part is actually necessary for correctness, because an ideal production install will only have one instance per node and won't require any shenanigans to support multiple instances.",
