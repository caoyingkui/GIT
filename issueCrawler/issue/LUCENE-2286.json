    "description": "I think we should enable setDiscountOverlaps in DefaultSimilarity by default.\n\nIf you are using synonyms or commongrams or a number of other 0-posInc-term-injecting methods, these currently screw up your length normalization.\nThese terms have a position increment of zero, so they shouldnt count towards the length of the document.\n\nI've done relevance tests with persian showing the difference is significant, and i think its a big trap to anyone using synonyms, etc: your relevance can actually get worse if you don't flip this boolean flag.",

In my opinion the backwards break is the easiest way to go.\n\nin practice it won't hurt existing docs, and if someone is concerned about bad ranking (because the newly indexed docs suddenly are ranked better), they can turn this off with the boolean until the get a chance to reindex all docs.
