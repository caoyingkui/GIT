    "description": "In Lucene's top-level documentation, there are links to Description sections in Javadocs, e.g. in the Getting Started section: to the Lucene demo; to an Introduction to Lucene's APIs; and to the Analysis overview.\n\nAll of these links are anchored at #overview_description or #package_description, but it looks like Java8 switched how these anchors are named: in the 6.0\u0010.0, 6.0.1 and now the 6.1.0 RC1 javadocs, these anchors are named with dots rather than underscores: #overview.description and #package.description.  As a result, the documentation links go to the right page, but the browser stays at the top of the page because it can't find the now-misnamed anchors.",
