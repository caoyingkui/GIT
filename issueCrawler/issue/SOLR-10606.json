    "description": "The suspend-trigger and resume-trigger APIs currently throw error if you try to invoke them with #EACH (meaning all triggers) when no triggers are configured in ZK. IMO, this should be allowed. I can foresee devops scripts which, for safety, need to do that blindly.\n\nSecondly, the suspend and resume trigger APIs should return the actual list of triggers suspended or resumed when called with #EACH.",
