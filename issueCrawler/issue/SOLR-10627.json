This does not work and does not protect any operation \n\nThe security API should throw an error when such a permission is created . For the well-known permissions, we already know the value of collection . \n\n\n\tif collection:null is specified for a per-collection permission, that should be ignored\n\tfor permissions where collection is not required , such as collection-admin-edit , security-edit , value of collection is null anyway , no other value should be allowed to be specified",
