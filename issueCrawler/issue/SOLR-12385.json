    "description": "SolrTestCaseHS is extended only by JSON facet and JSON request tests.\n\nSolrTestCaseHS was introduced with JSON faceting in SOLR-7214 (I believe \"HS\" is short for HelioSearch, where the functionality was originally developed). It appears\u00a0to enable a primitive distributed functionality, with no ZooKeeper, allowing tight control of document distribution, like SolrCloud's implicit routing. \u00a0Some JSON-specific handling stuff in there too, which I think could be relocated to JSONTestUtil.\n\nAlan Woodward and others did a bunch of test conversions to SolrCloudTestCase (e.g. SOLR-9132, SOLR-9110, SOLR-9065), but AFAICT never mentioned SolrTestCaseHS-based tests as a target.",

Some of that class should prob just go back into SolrTestCaseJ4, but some of it (the client stuff) might make sense somewhere else. ",
