    "description": "The CachingNaiveBayesClassifier gives different results than the SimpleNaiveBayesClassifier.  This is due to the fact that the CachineNaiveBayesClassifier does not calculate the log prior on the class (category) names, as it should.\n\nThis bug has been fixed, and a patch has been attached to this issue.\n\nThis affects master, as well as previous releases up to version 6.4.",
