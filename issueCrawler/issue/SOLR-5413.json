    "description": "This is a simple RequestHandler wrapper around ConcordanceCooccurSearcher submitted in LUCENE-5318. It reanalyzes the concordance windows and ranks keywords wrt the target value of the concordance search. \n\nDoes have some minimal support for SolrCloud, including distributed tf*idf.\n\n*Following Yonik's Law* \nThis is patch is more of a placeholder for a much more polished draft. Among other things, test scripts and javadocs are forthcoming!",
