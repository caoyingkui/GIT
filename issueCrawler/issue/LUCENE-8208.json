            "content": "Ignacio Vera  The method is comparing two vectors, in space, to see if they are parallel.  But I agree that it is not in agreement with its name.\n\nI would suggest we keep this functionality as is but change the name of the method to \"isParallel()\".  Then we can also introduce \"isNumericallyIdentical()\" to basically just compare x, y, and z values.  We will need to change most usages in the code to isParallel(). ",
