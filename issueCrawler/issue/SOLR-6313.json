            "content": "I've removed the use port 8983 as a special server 1 port.\n\nNow, a 'cloud view only' Solr is available at port 8900. It won't register as a live_node, but you can use it to view the cluster at http://localhost:8900/solr/#/~cloud. I like to use an auto refresh plugin to monitor.\n\nThe rest of the servers are at ports 8901, 8902, etc.\n\nI've also done work on the stop scripts to help make it harder to start again before things are really stopped, forcing you to kill java processes manually.\n\nOther little improvements here and there.
