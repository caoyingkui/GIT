    "description": "This is a spin-off from SOLR-2585.\n\nCurrently o.a.l.s.s.SpellChecker and o.a.l.s.s.DirectSpellChecker support two \"Suggest Modes\":\n1. Suggest for terms that are not in the index.\n2. Suggest \"more popular\" terms.\n\nThis issue is to add a third Suggest Mode:\n3. Suggest always.\n\nThis will assist users in developing context-sensitive spell suggestions and/or did-you-mean suggestions.  See SOLR-2585 for a full discussion.\n\nNote that o.a.l.s.s.SpellChecker already can support this functionality, if the user passes in a NULL term & IndexReader.  This, however, is not intutive.  o.a.l.s.s.DirectSpellChecker currently has no support for this third Suggest Mode.",

Included here for possible 3.x inclusion)\n\tA new Unit Test method for 0.a.l.s.s.SpellChecker tests \"SUGGEST_MORE_POPULAR\" and \"SUGGEST_ALWAYS\" (prior, \"morePopular\" had no test coverage).\n\tA new Unit Test scenario added to TestDirectSpellChecker for testing \"SUGGEST_ALWAYS\".\n\n ",
