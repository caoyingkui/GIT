Likewise, solr/contrib/uima/src/java/org/apache/solr/uima/processor/UIMAUpdateRequestProcessor.java does not have an accessor for the SolrUIMAConfiguration object",

            "content": "Yes, I wrote a UimaSearchHandler that extends SearchHandler to do \"adhoc\" uima analysis.  It is configured to reference the same updateRequestProcessorChain that is used during index time but in order to generically know what fields to return I need public access to the SolrUIMAConfiguration and fieldMappings.  I don't have time to write a testcase, but, here's some sample code that uses it:\n\n\n          UpdateRequestProcessorChain chain = req.getCore().getUpdateProcessingChain(uimaChain);\n          List<UpdateRequestProcessorFactory> processors = chain.getProcessors();\n          UpdateRequestProcessorFactory factory = processors.get(0);\n          UpdateRequestProcessor processor = factory.getInstance(req, null, null);\n\n          SolrUIMAConfiguration conf = ((UIMAUpdateRequestProcessor)processor).getConfiguration();\n          Map<String, Map<String, MapField>> map = conf.getTypesFeaturesFieldsMapping();\n          for(Map.Entry<String,Map<String,MapField>> entry : map.entrySet())\n          {\n            String annotationClass = entry.getKey();\n            annotationClasses.add(annotationClass);\n          }\n\n ",
