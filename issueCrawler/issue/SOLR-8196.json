Historically e.g. in https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8/solr/test-framework/src/java/org/apache/solr/cloud/MiniSolrCloudCluster.java MiniSolrCloudCluster created the directory itself but that got moved up to the caller (haven't yet delved into when or why) subsequently. Conceptually if the caller passed something that could create subdirectories then MiniSolrCloudCluster could create as many or as few subdirectories as are needed.\n\nSemi-related ticket, SOLR-7886 for factoring out a TestMiniSolrCloudClusterBase class (these comments here for MiniSolrCloudCluster itself).
