I'm not sure where this ends. Imagine an analyzer, which having considered and emitted tokens for a whole document, chooses to append some  tokens positioned which  has offsets referencing much earlier sections of the document. (Why, I'm not sure but there's nothing to say this couldn't happen).\n\n>>It seems like maybe the only way to handle some of this stuff is two passes\n\nMaybe a special \"OrderFixer\" TokenStream could be used by to wrap \"rewinding\" token streams such as yours and then accumulate all tokens in a  buffer before then sorting and outputting them in ascending start offset order.

Your test expected 2 tags.\n\nWho is right?\n\nThis is a snippet from Yonik's test:\n    query = new QueryParser(\"text\",new WhitespaceAnalyzer()).parse(\"hi speed\");\n    highlighter = new Highlighter(new QueryScorer(query));\n    result = highlighter.getBestFragments(getTS2(), s, 3, \"...\");\n    assertEquals(\"<B>Hi-Speed</B>10 foo\",result);\n\nand yours:\n\n      String srchkey = \"BC FG\"; \n      String expectedResult=\"A<B>BC</B>DE<B>FG</B>HIJ\"; \n\nI don't really have an opinion either way so I'll turn it over to you\n\nCheers\nMark\n\n ",
