            "content": "OK, so the idea is pretty simple: reuse the existing algorithm for single valued string fields that uses the FieldCache.\nCount per-segment with a per-segment accumulator array, then merge all of the counts at the end (probably with a priority queue - same method used in MultiTermEnum).  Seems like a good opportunity to introduce some threading and do the per-segment counting in parallel. "

            "content": "Here's the first cut - seems to work fine.\nYou can try it out with facet.method=fcs (the extra \"s\" can either stand for the plural, since there are multiple field caches, or for segment).\n\nI haven't introduced a way to limit the number of threads used... it's currently one per segment.\nI'm thinking of a local param named \"threads\" for that.\n\nNote: this will probably only make sense in NRT scenarios.  It will take up more memory for the field caches, more memory per-request for the accumulator arrays, and more CPU since an additional merge step is needed.  One possible side benefit is a reduction in field cache memory (due to field cache insanity - per-segment and whole-index field caches both being populated). "

This also required adding a way to turn off fieldcache sanity checking.\n\n "
