    "description": "When Solr transitions to requiring Java 8, please upgrade to Caffeine. The performance should be relatively the same. The per-instance memory usage should be smaller and Solr may decide to opt-in to use some of the additional features. The only drawback is that the jar size is larger due to code generation, though that may be trimmed over time and usually is not a concern for server-side applications.\n\nConcurrentLinkedHashMap changes will continue to be minimal, even more so now, and driven by requests from Java 6 users unable to upgrade. Caffeine is ideally the upgrade path for Guava cache users too, which due to Android cannot be significantly modified.\n\nCaffeine: https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine\nBenchmarks: https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Benchmarks\nConcurrentLinkedHashMap: https://code.google.com/p/concurrentlinkedhashmap",

There's a chance that branch_5x will be upgraded to require Java 8 before it is retired to maintenance mode, in the same way that we bumped our requirements to Java 7 with the release of 4.8.0.\n\nIf you check out the trunk code, you can patch it and provide repeatable benchmarks to prove to us that your library will be stable and provide a performance advantage.\n\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute ",

            "content": "This ticket is not an attempt to advocate a competing project, but rather is a notification that ConcurrentLinkedHashMap has reached its end-of-life and will only receive maintenance updates. Similarly Guava's cache is in maintenance mode, performance improvements are not accepted due to a lack of owner, and Guava stay JDK6 due to Android. As the author or co-author of all three caching libraries, this is the upgrade path that I recommend. Solr can instead choose to stay as is or migrate to an alternative library.\n\nDoes Solr have performance tests? The before mentioned benchmarks show that Caffeine has equivalent performance to CLHM v1.4.2. However, Solr uses the older v1.2 dependency which typically performs reasonably well under application load but much worse in a micro-benchmark. That's due to the original focus on avoiding lock contention (Java 5 synchronizers were slow) and later resolving GC pressure under synthetic stress tests. The evolutionary improvements to Caffeine's algorithms mostly reduce memory usage and has only a subtle impact on the performance profile.\n\nCaffeine executes over 1.5 million unit tests and the changes pass Solr's test suite. Any latent bugs will be addressed upon discovery. ",
