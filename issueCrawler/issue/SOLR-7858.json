    "description": "Angular UI is very close to feature complete. Once SOLR-7856 is dealt with, it should function well in most cases. I propose that, as soon as 5.3 has been released, we make the Angular UI default, ready for the 5.4 release. We can then fix any more bugs as they are found, but more importantly start working on the features that were the reason for doing this work in the first place.",

Add an Upgrading \nnote pointing out that the URLs may be slightly different, and how to \naccess the old UI if they have problems\n\n\n\tbackport trunk changes (#3) to 5x for 5.3 (or later if problems/delays\npop up)\n\n\n\nAnd: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201504.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.2.02.1504301414460.19000@frisbee%3E\n\n...\nWe might want to tweak those URLs slightly to be a little less confusing \n... ie \"old.html\" and \"new.html\" (at least until after 5.3) ... i mean, i \njust the paragraph you rwote above, but w/o looking at it i've already \nforgoten if \"index.html\" is hte new one or hte old one.\n\nSo imagine if a 5.2 user has in their browser...\n\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin.html#/collection1\n\n...and is trying to remember if this is the new one (that they should get \nuse to / help test) or the fuly qualified name of the old one that is \ngoing away.\n\nLikewise imagine if a 5.42 user sees the same URL, and reads a note that \nthe \"old UI\" is going to be removed in 6.0 and is trying to figure out if \nthat affects him.\n\nA few followup comments...\n\na) that \"step 3\" above (changing hte defualt on trunk first) is really important ... you want that change to sit on trunk for a good while, so that devs working on trunk and manually testing things are using the new UI anytime they run stuff on trunk, and helping to find problems \u2013 even if no users \"try\" the new UI in the released versions of Solr\n\nb) not sure why i didn't mention it before, but adding a generic header to all of the \"old\" UI pages warning people that they are using the old UI and here is a link to the new UI is something that should definitely be added once the default is changed (it could be added even before the default is changed with ome wording tweaks: \"Please try the new UI..\" vs \"You are looking at the old deprecated UI, please switch to....\") to help reduce the # of bug reports / feature requests we get about the old UI and to reduce user frustration (ie; they see in some future release notes that there is a new collection admin screen, but they can't find it when they load \"the admin UI\" bookmark they have.)\n\n\n\nHaving something like \"admin#\" or \"admin/#/\" (whatever makes sense for the code) in the URL would likely eliminate that confusion for most people. Even \"index.html\" in the URL (which the new UI has now) would be helpful, but using the word \"admin\" in some way would be better.\n\nIn the long term, I don't know if this is will actually help things or decrease novice user confusion (the URLs, when loaded in a browser, is already clearly a UI, will making the UI urls longer really help people notice \"oh hey, maybe this UI based URL isn't a URL that programtic client code should talk to\" ?)  but if this approach is taken it should be very carefully considered in terms of how it impacts \"reserved words\" for things like collection names.\n\nIt's annoying enough if we (in the short term) have reserved paths like \"/old.ui.html\" but if you try to use \"/admin\" as a prefix to indicate that it's for the UI, you'll probably break things like /admin/cores and /admin/collections \u2013 let alone the long term impacts of saying something like \"You can't have a collection named 'ui' because of the '/ui'.\" etc...

            "content": "Thanks Chris Hostetter (Unused) for your rich perspective.\n\nFirstly, to answer your question: yes, the new UI has been in trunk/5x since 5.2. As to whether it has been functional, there are a lot less bugs than there were, although you are right to observe that it needs usage.\n\n= o =\nURLs:\n\nIn your comments you were concerned about how a user would be able to find out which UI they are using and what the purpose of the change is. I've added links at the top right of the old, and new UIs to switch between them, and a  link that points to a wiki page explaining further. I hope this does sufficient in terms of messaging - although your suggestion of a banner saying \"this is the old UI, go try the new one-->\" seems like a good idea.\n\nPersonally, I'd support a redirect from http://localhost:8983/ and http://localhost:8983/solr/ to http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/ and host the entire UI there. You mention the risk of URL overlap, but we already have that issue, in more dangerous ways, with files in the UI using the URL space that end-users access. At least if we switched to /admin/, we would only be in conflict with ourselves, in which case it is infinitely more manageable. And, it is already pretty much a given that 'admin' wouldn't work as a collection name.\n\nI would, however, suggest we keep this for trunk/6.0. As a code change, it is small. As a usability one, it is much bigger.\n\n= o =\n\nBased upon your suggestions, my release proposal and schedule would be:\n\n\t5x already has links between old/new UIs so users of 5.4 will be able to get to the new one easily\n\tThere is also a ? link that points to a wiki page explaining the change and asking for bug reports\n\tAdd a banner saying \"go try the new UI\" on the old one, both in trunk and 5x\n\tChange URLs in trunk straight away so that the new UI is the default (old one as /original-ui.html)\n\tAdd a note in CHANGES.txt for 5.4 stating clearly that it will become default in 5.5.\n\tAssuming no major clangers, for 5.5, change the URLs to make the new default (old one is /original-ui.html)\n\tFor trunk, change the UI to serve from /admin/. Files remain in the same location.\n\n ",
