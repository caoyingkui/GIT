    "description": "The current API/implementation has a number of potential issues, including encouraging the use of the response object after the locally created request object has been closed, and the fact that the \"child\" request has no actual relationship with the \"parent\" request, meaning that either the searcher or the schema objects could change.  A searcher changing would most commonly manifest as incorrect documents being returned or other random exceptions during the writing of the response.",
