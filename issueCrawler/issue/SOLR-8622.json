    "description": "Since SOLR-4792 there is no way of obtaining a complete Solr as a Maven artifact. IMHO, distributing a ZIP artifact instead of a WAR file artifact would make a lot of sense.\n\nThis would make it possible to include it in a Maven build, insert custom schema and configuration, and package it for deployment.\n\nConsuming a Maven artifact in a CI build is also easier than doing a plain HTTP download from one of the mirrors. Many people use e.g. a Nexus Maven proxy repository that caches artifacts, so a desired artifact needs to be downloaded from internet only once.\n\nWould it be possible to distribute Solr as a ZIP file artifact via Maven Central?",
