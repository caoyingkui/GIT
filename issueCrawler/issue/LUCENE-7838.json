As soon as we provide releases of lucene-sandbox I assume we expect people and other modules to use it.\n\nNew inter-module dependencies (of any kind) I think should also deserve communication on the JIRA issue and I don't see any mention here.\n\nSince this is only impacting master branch I had thought there was no need to explicitly mention that; on the other hand FuzzyLikeThisQuery lives in sandbox therefore I had assumed there was no need to explicitly specify that in the issue.\n\nI also don't see a CHANGES.txt entry\n\nright, there's no such entry.\n\nI don't see a patch file either but I admit I welcome that \n\nI'm not sure I get your point here, would you have expected a patch ?

Otherwise things can quickly become hairy, eg. because of circular dependencies, or because pulling a single module would pull most other modules through transitive dependencies, which defeats the purpose of having modules. Dependeng on sandbox makes it ever worse since the barrier for adding/removing code is supposed to be low, yet this new dependency means that special care needs to be taken if we want to remove FuzzyLikeThis.
