Yonik Seeley, were you thinking in this use case?\nI am still a little bit confuse, what are the benefits of this patch ?\nThe issue I saw is that internal requests can add parameter that are not intended for macro expansion (for example in facet refinement), and treating them as macros can cause exceptions or incorrect results (see the test case I added).\nIn my opinion the feature I mentioned was quite useful and it has been supported for a while \nWe can't reopen this Jira, since it was already released, but feel free to create a new one to support your use case ",
