    "description": "Use case:\nWe've got a lot of large, mostly search-only indices. These indices are not re-optimized once \"deployed\".   Docs in them do not get updated, but they do get deleted.  After a while, the number of deleted docs grows, but it's hard to tell how many documents have been deleted.\n\nExposing the number of deleted docs via *Reader.deletedDocs() method let's you get to this number.\n\nI'm attaching  patch that touches the following:\n\nM      src/test/org/apache/lucene/index/TestSegmentReader.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/MultiReader.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/FilterIndexReader.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/ParallelReader.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/SegmentReader.java\n\nSegmentReader also got a public static main(String[]) that takes 1 command-line parameter, a path to the index to check, and prints out the number of deleted docs.",

Maybe that should be added to the existing IndexReader.main ?\n\nOr maybe it's time to start an app/class in contrib/index that takes various command line parameters and prints out information about the index?  If so, I'll move that to a new JIRA issue. ",
