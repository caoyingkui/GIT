    "description": "Raised from http://www.mail-archive.com/java-user@lucene.apache.org/msg40064.html\n\nThe JavaDoc says:\n\n\n  /**\n   * Close this ReferenceManager to future {@link #acquire() acquiring}. Any\n   * references that were previously {@link #acquire() acquired} won't be\n   * affected, and they should still be {@link #release released} when they are\n   * not needed anymore.\n   */\n\n\n\nThe first sentence is not really clear. I would expect something like:\n\n\nClose this ReferenceManager when the application is shutting down or the\n underlying index will be disposed. Any references that were previously\n {@link #acquire() acquired} won't be affected, and they should still be \n{@link #release released} when they are not needed anymore.\n\n\n\nFurther more, the JavaDoc does not declare that an exception will be thrown on any method.",

A\n    * reference manager should be closed if the reference to the managed resource\n    * should be disposed or the application using the {@link ReferenceManager}\n    * is shutting down. The managed resource might not be released immediately,\n    * if the {@link ReferenceManager} user is holding on to a previously\n    * {@link #acquire() acquired} reference. The resource will be released once\n    * when the last reference is {@link #release(Object) released}. Those\n    * references can still be used as if the manager was still active.\n    * </p>\n    * <p>\n    * Applications should not {@link #acquire() acquire} references from this\n    * manager once this method has been called. {@link #acquire() Acquiring} a\n    * resource on a closed {@link ReferenceManager} will throw an\n    * {@link AlreadyClosedException}.\n    * </p>\n    * \n    * @throws IOException\n    *           if the underlying reader of the current reference could not be closed\n\n\n\nI have changed especially the @throws tag because I do not see as a user any connection between a decRef and an IOE w/o reading further JavaDocs.\n\nPlease apply the patch to 3.6.x too.\n\nThanks!
