            "content": "Thank you for the bug. However, I think that the patch is not correct.\nThe bug was introduced in the current CVS head by an optimization in\nBooleanScorer. It does not affect the current release. I tried to fix the\nbug. Seems to work. But I am not 100% sure. Another way to fix the bug would be\nto switch off the optimization by simply deleting score(HitCollector hc) and\nscore(HitCollector hc, int max) implementation from BooleanScorer. I tried\nthis and it works too.\n\nChristoph ",
