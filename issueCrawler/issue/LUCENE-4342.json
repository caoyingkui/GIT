    "description": "See attached patch for a failing test\n\nBasically, it's a simple point and radius scenario that works great as long as args.setDistPrecision(0.0); is called. Once the default precision is used (2.5%), it doesn't work as expected.\n\nThe distance between the 2 points in the patch is 35.75 KM. Taking into account the 2.5% error the effective radius without false negatives/positives should be around 34.8 KM. This test fails with a radius of 33 KM.",

Because GeoHashUtils is in Spatial4j (quite debatable), some of the bug is still there where I need to get a fix in for Spatial4j0.3 but in the mean time I simply inlined the relevant lookup code with it fixed.\n\nI also modified the algorithm in which a specific error distance is derived from a shape and the percent.  It's now half the diagonal distance of opposite corners of its bounding box. ",

This affects the levels needed when using the default 1m precision calculated from the factory.  The attached patch removes the \"+ 1\" that shouldn't be there.  I'll commit it soon.\n\nNote that this whole issue (not just this specific patch) affects the max length of indexed prefixes given a specified target precision (default of 1m).  So to retain compatibility, you should either re-index the data or add maxLevels=\"...\" (as interpreted by the prefix tree factory) to explicitly say the number of levels used when the data was indexed.  FWIW the Solr adapters, in a patch, will log this statistic on startup. ",
