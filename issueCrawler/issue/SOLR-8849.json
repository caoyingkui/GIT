    "description": "Looking into the ChaosMonkey code a bit, and it seems like this class \u2013 particularly the way monkeyThread is defined \u2013 uses randomness in a way that makes it extremely unlikely that it will ever create reproducible failures.\n\nObviously in any test where there are multiple concurrent threads, timing issues might prevent test reproducibility \u2013 but in this case, even the sequence of \"chaos\" actions the monkeyThread takes won't be reproducible if anyother concurrent test thread accesses LuceneTestCase.random() ...\n\n\n      public void run() {\n        while (!stop) {\n          try {\n    \n            Random random = LuceneTestCase.random();\n            // ... lots of stuff using random, or calling methods that use LuceneTestCase.random() directly\n\n\n\nIt seems like it would be a lot better if ChaosMonkey's constructor created it's own private Random chaosRand using LuceneTestCase.random() as a seed, and then used chaosRand to make all random choices in it's methods.\n\nThat way at least the sequence of chaotic operations made by ChaosMonkey would be consistent for a given test seed, even if the exact timing/interleaving of those operations relative to other operations by other threads couldn't be garunteed.",
