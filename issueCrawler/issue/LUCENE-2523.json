The message is then generated in the exception ctor and looks identical everywhere in the code. Where the filename is not available, it is left out (null). Maybe we should add the filename to CodecUtils, to be able to display it on errors. This helps finding out, which file has wrong header. Or is there a way to get file name from IndexInput?\n\tI keep the segments.gen version check disabled, this seems to be needed on windows, to be able to retry.\n\n\n\nI will commit soon! ",
