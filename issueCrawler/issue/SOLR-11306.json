    "description": "Several of the example managed-schema files have an outdated comment about docValues and StrField.  In Solr 6.6.0 these are under solr-6.6.0/solr/server and the lines where the comment starts for each file are:\nsolr/configsets/basic_configs/conf/managed-schema:216:   \nsolr/configsets/data_driven_schema_configs/conf/managed-schema:221:    \nsolr/configsets/sample_techproducts_configs/conf/managed-schema:317\n\nIn the case of Solr-6.6.0/server/solr/configsets/basic_configs/conf/managed-schema, shortly after the comment  are some lines which seem to directly contradict the comment:\n\n216      <!-- The StrField type is not analyzed, but indexed/stored verbatim.\n   217         It supports doc values but in that case the field needs to be\n   218         single-valued and either required or have a default value.\n   219        -->\n\nOn line 221 a StrField is declared with docValues that is multiValued:\n221      <fieldType name=\"strings\" class=\"solr.StrField\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" multiValued=\"true\" docValues=\"true\" />\n\nAlso note that the comments above say that the field must either be required or have a default value, but line 221 appears to satisfy neither condition.\n\nThe JavaDocs indicate that StrField can be multi-valued https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_6_0//core/org/apache/lucene/index/DocValuesType.html",
