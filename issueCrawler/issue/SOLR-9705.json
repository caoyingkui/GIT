    "description": "Starting with Solr 6.3, Streaming Expressions have the capability to run parallel batch jobs. So it would be useful to implement some batch algorithms. One  useful batch algorithm is PageRank https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank.\n\nPageRank can be used as a general purpose approach for ranking nodes in a graph. It can also be used for ranking web pages based on link popularity.",
