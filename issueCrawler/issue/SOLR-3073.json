So maybe this is a general response writing bug?\n\nI attached an alternative fix for this issue. Instead of invoking FieldType#toObject method it invokes FieldType#toExternal method in the TopGroupsResultTransformer class. I think this is a better approach for distributed grouping since there is no overhead of creating an UUID object (UUID#fromString). For distributed grouping we can just threat all ids as strings. "
