We should give something close to what you actually might want to use - which is not to setup logging to log to the console.\n\nFirst I'm gathering feedback from others though.\n\nMy current leaning is to doc the wiki and what not to mention the sample log props and use of -D to put it in action, and to setup the default log props to log to the ./logs dir.

Before this patch, the current state, I could use the logging admin page to enable debug logging for a known Solr logger but the debug output wouldn't go anywhere because the default threshold for the console logger is INFO. This patch includes a commented line to lower the console threshold.\n\nFYI I still hate JDK14 logging (aka JUL); but nonetheless it's the default as provided with Solr. "

There is already some hacks in the build somehow related to this:\n\nin lucene/common-build.xml: <property name=\"tests.loggingfile\" value=\"/dev/null\"/>\nand in the JUnitResultFormatter to reboot logging for each test case: \n try {\n      LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration();\n    } catch (Exception e) {}\n\n "

It does seem important for newbies to get the instant console feedback of \"address already in use\" or other exceptions.  I actually find it pretty useful myself (when I forget that I already have an instance running, or just for seeing requests come in by default, etc).\n\nWe can also document it right in the example/README.txt!

There will be no changes to default categories and so nothing will actually log at these detailed levels until they are changed by the user. I also think there should be a prominent notice on the logging jsp page to tell users they are not going to see the more detailed log levels in Solr's default setup without making changes to the logging configuration.
