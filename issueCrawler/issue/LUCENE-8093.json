Some of the normalization components can change the length of the string (e.g. ascii folder or german normalizer) in rarer cases but in general they are just normalizing characters and won't confuse e.g. wildcard ? operator or regexes \"too much\".

            "content": "TrimFilter would I think normally be used with a Tokenizer that doesn't split things up, like KeywordTokenizer or NGramTokenizer, in which case removing surrounding whitespace seems like a natural normalization to me, much like lowercasing.  And the issue with stemmers is that they can completely change the token, such that prefixes or fuzzy queries won't make sense, which doesn't apply here? ",

            "content": "Seems like a reasonable argument to me. The other main things to worry about IMO:\n\n\twill the special syntax (e.g. of regex or wildcard or whatever) will confuse the filter?\n\twill the filter always return 1:1 token for token or will it remove/add tokens (this will confuse the queryparser).\n\n\n\nNot sure there are any issues here for the trimfilter, it returns an empty string if you give it all whitespace so I think its ok there ",
