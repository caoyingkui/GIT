Starting from Spring framework is a little too many levels away.\n\nIs the code-level issue (QueryResponse.asMap) happening in the Solr or in the Spring library? If it is in the Spring library, you need to open a case against that.\n\nIf it is happening in the Solr, could you give a Solr-level explanation (e.g. a query against a shipped example). This would really help to understand the problem. ",
