            "content": "thanks Mikhail Khludnev, unfortunately there's a problem...\n\nWhen i wrote that quick patch yesterday, i didn't bother trying to run all tests because I took it as a given that we probably had a bunch of test schemas with copy/pasted field definitions that violated this but weren't problematic because they didn't actaully use child docs.\n\nWhen i went to run test today to move forward with this issue, I realized that in addition to schemas with explicit _root_ fields, i was also seeing failures from tests that used \"*\" dynamicFields that were matching _root_.  Since it's probably more common for folks to have something like <dynamicField name=\"*\" type=\"text\" /> in their schemas then it is that folks are using childDocs, i don't really think we should fail on startup in those cases.\n\nSo the update patch tweaks the logic so that hard failure on IndexSchema init is only if _root_ is explicitly defined.  Later, in AddUpdateCommand.flatten, I added a stricter check to fail updates that involve child docs unless the _root_ field type matches.  I also added a test for this situation, and updated any existing schema files that were problematic.\n\nWDYT? ",
