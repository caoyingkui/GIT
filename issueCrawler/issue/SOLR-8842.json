    "description": "Currently the well-known permissions are using the HTTP atributes, such as method, uri, params etc to identify the corresponding permission name such as 'read', 'update' etc. Expose this value through an API so that it can be more accurate and handle various versions of the API\n\nRequestHandlers will be able to implement an interface to provide the name\n\ninterface PermissionNameProvider {\n     Name getPermissionName(SolrQueryRequest req)\n}\n\n \n\nThis means many significant changes to the API\n1) name does not mean a set of http attributes. Name is decided by the requesthandler . Which means it's possible to use the same name across different permissions.  \nexamples\n\n{\n\"permissions\": [\n    {//this permission applies to all collections\n      \"name\": \"read\",\n      \"role\": \"dev\"\n    },\n    {\n     \n     // this applies to only collection x. But both means you are hitting a read type API\n      \"name\": \"read\",\n      \"collection\": \"x\",\n      \"role\": \"x_dev\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n \n\n2) so far we have been using the name as something unique. We use the name to do an update-permission , delete-permission or even when you wish to insert a permission before another permission we used to use the name. Going forward it is not possible. Every permission will get an implicit index. example\n\n{\n  \"permissions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"read\",\n      \"role\": \"dev\",\n       //this attribute is automatically assigned by the system\n      \"index\" : 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"read\",\n      \"collection\": \"x\",\n      \"role\": \"x_dev\",\n      \"index\" : 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n3) example update commands\n\n{\n  \"set-permission\" : {\n    \"index\": 2,\n    \"name\": \"read\",\n    \"collection\" : \"x\",\n    \"role\" :[\"xdev\",\"admin\"]\n  },\n  //this deletes the permission at index 2\n  \"delete-permission\" : 2,\n  //this will insert the command before the first item\n  \"set-permission\": {\n    \"name\":\"config-edit\",\n    \"role\":\"admin\",\n    \"before\":1\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n4) you could construct a  permission purely with http attributes and you don't need any name for that. As expected, this will be appended atthe end of the list of permissions\n\n{\n  \"set-permission\": {\n                     \"collection\": null,\n                     \"path\":\"/admin/collections\",\n                     \"params\":{\"action\":[LIST, CREATE]},\n                     \"role\": \"admin\"}\n}\n\n\nUsers with existing configuration will not observe any change in behavior. But the commands issued to manipulate the permissions will be different .",
