Because online NLP services are error-prone, users should be able to choose whether solr skips the text processing (but source text can be indexed) for the document or throws a runtime exception so that solr can stop adding documents entirely.",

            "content": "Hi Tommaso, thank you for updating the patch!\n\nIn my patch, I try to log the first 100 chars of the target text in the error message because an online NLP service I'm using is error-prone when I post a large text. But you are using SolrInputDocument in the updated patch. I'd like my method rather than logging whole solr document.\n\nI think that users who set ignoreErrors=true want to know the fact that the error occurs, but don't want to see whole document in the error message.

Considering your comment I am wondering if it may be better to get the uniqueid so that one can easily debug the document which caused that error from that without having to see the text in the log.
