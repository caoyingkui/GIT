    "description": "I found that IndexWriter.optimize(int) method does not pick up large segments with a lot of deletes even when most of the docs are deleted. And the existence of such segments affected the query performance significantly.\n\nI created an index with 1 million docs, then went over all docs and updated a few thousand at a time.  I ran optimize(20) occasionally. What saw were large segments with most of docs deleted. Although these segments did not have valid docs they remained in the directory for a very long time until more segments with comparable or bigger sizes were created.\n\nThis is because LogMergePolicy.findMergeForOptimize uses the size of segments but does not take the number of deleted documents into consideration when it decides which segments to merge. So, a simple fix is to use the delete count to calibrate the segment size. I can create a patch for this.",

I think you're referring to \"normal\" merges?\n\nI think this approach is reasonable and a good step forward.  Can you\nmake this behaviour get/settable?  I think we should default to the\nold behaviour until 3.0, and then switch it to default to the new one\nat 3.0 (to preserve back compat).\n\nThinking more about this... I think we can further improve how\nLog*MergePolicy takes deletes into account.  Ie, why not explicitly\nmeasure the deletions and bias merge selection to favor merging away\nsegments that have the most deletions?\n\nThis might require relaxing the merge policy so that it's allowed to\npick fewer than mergeFactor segments to merge at once; perhaps it's\ngiven a min/max mergeFactor.\n\nLikely such a change should be a new merge policy...

            "content": "RE: implementing custom MergePolicy\nLet me describe in detail on problems of implementing a custom MergePolicy:\n\n1) In IndexWriter code, such methods on MergePolicy is called, e.g. findMergesForOptimize. I believe that is the contract for implementing your own MergePolicy. However, it is \"hidden\" by the javadoc in terms of documentation, and furthermore, it is hidden because these methods are package protected. So to implement your own MergePolicy, you have to resort back to sneaking the class into the package.\n\n2) Not only seg/getUseCompoundFile is no longer applicable if LogMergePolicy is not used, also popular methods such as set/getMergeFactor etc. are only applicable to LogMergePolicy. (Just to clarify, useCompoundFile is a package-level protected method on the base MergePolicy class, so my guess is that set/getCompoundFile should be applicable to all implementations of MergePolicy.\n\nThis brings up another issue about the practice of having to \"sneak\" classes into a package. We are looking at making our Lucene code, OSGI compliant, and this becomes an issue because we cannot have multiple \"bundles\" exporting the same package. Which means, I would have to repackage lucene to include my classes that I have snuck into some lucene packages. I would like to use a standard distribution of  a lucene jar (as suggested/echoed by some luceners). ",

It's been discussed before:\n\n  http://www.nabble.com/MergePolicy-public-but-SegmentInfos-package-protected--tt22687527.html\n\nI suppose since merge selection needs so little info about a segment, we could make a public thine wrapper/veneer that exposes a limited number of things.  Or maybe we go whole hog and simply make SegmentInfos/SegmentInfo public.\n\nit is hidden because these methods are package protected\n\nIf we could javadoc certain package protected classes, that'd give you the javadocs at least.  Or we should simply make these methods public?\n\nNot only seg/getUseCompoundFile is no longer applicable if LogMergePolicy is not used, also popular methods such as set/getMergeFactor etc. are only applicable to LogMergePolicy.\n\nBut the notion of a mergeFactor is very much a LogMergePolicy specific thing.  Other merge policies might not limit themselves to always merging mergeFactor segments at once.  These are convenience methods on IndexWriter (that simply forward the request to the MergePolicy).\n\nmy guess is that set/getCompoundFile should be applicable to all implementations of MergePolicy\n\nI think that'd make sense.
