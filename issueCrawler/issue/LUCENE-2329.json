    "description": "This is Mike's idea that was discussed in LUCENE-2293 and LUCENE-2324.\n\nIn order to avoid having very many long-living PostingList objects in TermsHashPerField we want to switch to parallel arrays.  The termsHash will simply be a int[] which maps each term to dense termIDs.\n\nAll data that the PostingList classes currently hold will then we placed in parallel arrays, where the termID is the index into the arrays.  This will avoid the need for object pooling, will remove the overhead of object initialization and garbage collection.  Especially garbage collection should benefit significantly when the JVM runs out of memory, because in such a situation the gc mark times can get very long if there is a big number of long-living objects in memory.\n\nAnother benefit could be to build more efficient TermVectors.  We could avoid the need of having to store the term string per document in the TermVector.  Instead we could just store the segment-wide termIDs.  This would reduce the size and also make it easier to implement efficient algorithms that use TermVectors, because no term mapping across documents in a segment would be necessary.  Though this improvement we can make with a separate jira issue.",

Ie the hash used for term vectors only holds the terms for that one doc (so it's much smaller), vs the primary hash that holds terms for all docs in the current RAM buffer.  So we'd be burning up much more RAM if we also key into the term vector's parallel arrays using the primary term id?\n\nBut I do think we should cutover to parallel arrays for TVTW, too.\n\nHow does the read performance of packed ints compare to \"normal\" int[] arrays?

Setting IW's RAM buffer to 200MB and the overall heap to 256MB forces the gc to run frequently.  The mark times are much more costly if we have all long-living PostingList objects in memory compared to parallel arrays.\n\nSo this is probably not a huge deal for \"normal\" indexing.  But once we can search on the RAM buffer it becomes much more attractive to fill up the RAM as much as you can.  And exactly in that case we safe a lot with this improvement. \n\nAlso note that the number of segments decreased by 22% (from 41 to 32).  This shows that the parallel-array approach needs less RAM, thus flushes less often and will cause less segment merges in the long run.  So a longer test with actual segment merges would show even bigger gains (with both big and small heaps).\n\nSo overall, I'm very happy with these results! ",
