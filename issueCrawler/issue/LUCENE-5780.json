    "description": "Robert found a case when the ordinal map can be quite wasteful in terms of memory usage: in order to be able to resolve values given a global ordinals, it stores two things:\n\n\tan identifier of the segment where the value is\n\tthe difference between the ordinal on the segment and the global ordinal\n\n\n\nThe issue is that OrdinalMap currently picks any of the segments that contain the value but we can do better: we can pick the first segment that has the value. This will help for two reasons:\n\n\tit will potentially require fewer bits per value to store the segment ids if NRT segments don't introduce new values\n\tif all values happen to appear in the first segment, then the map from global ords to deltas only stores zeros.\n\n\n\nI just tested on an index where all values are in the first segment and this helped reduce memory usage of the ordinal map by 4x (from 3.5MB to 800KB).",

            "content": "This looks good (+1 to commit to trunk/4.10) but i think we can do better, by explicitly sorting? E.g. take a long[] sizes parameter (can be optional and zeros would give us what we have today if we use a stable sort), that the user could populate either with valueCount or number of docs in the segment (both are probably a fine heuristic).\n\nI know this means we will need an array to remap lookups, but this only happens once per segment with the new LongValues api so it won't impact performance.
