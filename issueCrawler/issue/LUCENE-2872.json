    "description": "With PrefixCodedTermsReader/Writer we now encode each term standalone,\nie its bytes, metadata, details for postings (frq/prox file pointers),\netc.\n\nBut, this is costly when something wants to visit many terms but pull\nmetadata for only few (eg respelling, certain MTQs).  This is\nparticularly costly for sep codec because it has more metadata to\nstore, per term.\n\nSo instead I think we should block-encode all terms between indexed\nterm, so that the metadata is stored \"column stride\" instead.  This\nmakes it faster to enum just terms.",
