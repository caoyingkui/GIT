    "description": "It was recently pointed out to me that if you don't come from a java background, understanding the range of legal values for \"TrieIntField\" vs \"TrieLongField\" may not be obvious to you (particularly if you are use to dealing with databases that have INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, etc... with UNSIGNED vs SIGNED modifiers).  That subsequently made me realize that to this day the javadocs for the various FieldTypes don't explain the diff between the TrieFoo, SortableFoo, and Foo field types.",
