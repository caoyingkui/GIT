    "description": "In a very large cluster the Overseer is likely to be overloaded.If the same node is a serving a few other shards it can lead to OverSeer getting slowed down due to GC pauses , or simply too much of work  . If the cluster is really large , it is possible to dedicate high end h/w for OverSeers\n\nIt works as a new collection admin command\n\ncommand=addrole&role=overseer&node=192.168.1.5:8983_solr\n\nThis results in the creation of a entry in the /roles.json in ZK which would look like the following\n\n\n{\n\"overseer\" : [\"192.168.1.5:8983_solr\"]\n}\n\n\nIf a node is designated for overseer it gets preference over others when overseer election takes place. If no designated servers are available another random node would become the Overseer.\n\nLater on, if one of the designated nodes are brought up ,it would take over the Overseer role from the current Overseer to become the Overseer of the system",

            "content": "The strategy to implement this is as follows\n\nPrioritization logic run at Overseer node\n\n\tAny Overseer elect would first check for the presence of /roles.json in ZK. If not return\n\tlookup the children of /overseer_elect node and see if there are nodes with Overseer roles among children. If not return\n\tAll nodes whose seq number is smaller than that of the first Overseer role node is asked to disconnect and reconnect . So that those nodes will append themselves to the tail of the list and the Overseer role node would come up at the head\n\tAfter this process , the Overseer checks if it is itself  an Overseer role node , If not ,relinquish it's Overseer position and go back to election\n\n\n\nIf a new node comes up who is assigned an Overseer role, it has to ensure that it is at the head of the election queue ,\n\n\tIf any new node comes up, it checks for the /roles.json . If present , checks if it is assigned an overseer role, if yes , it checks if the head of the election queue is a node with Overseer role. If not, send a message to the current Overseer to run the prioritization logic\n\n "

It's a race, and the tests are showing how easy it is for multiple overseers to interfere with each other. We have to avoid those races, both because the current impls require it, but also because who knows what future things the overseer may do. The Overseer must be a mutually exclusive process 100%.\n\nI'm not sure that we can bullet proof this approach. Perhaps. But I wouldn't believe it until we had some much stronger testing. The current test fails almost every run for me when I run it in eclipse because Overseers interfere with each other.\n\nI'm also a little scared of the way this messes with the election process, but that appears like it should be okay.
