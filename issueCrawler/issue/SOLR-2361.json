    "description": "Currently configuration of Analysis Factories is done by the Factories reading from NamedLists.  This requires a Factory to know the name of its configuration values and makes testing complicated since configuration values need to be loaded into a NamedList and passed in.\n\nSimilar to SOLR-2360, we should allow configuration values to be injected into Factories via setters.  We can then remove the NamedList from most Factories.  We will need to keep the init method however, to allow Factories to do any configuration of themselves as a result of the injected values.",
