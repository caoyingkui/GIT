    "description": "According to the latest beastit report, this test is flakey but there is no mention of this test on Lucene/Solr Jenkins Test Failure Report.\n\nIn any case, the failure from the beastit report is interesting. The test expects to wait for a new collection to be created but exits in 1.6 seconds without any exceptions in the logs. This warrants more investigation.",
