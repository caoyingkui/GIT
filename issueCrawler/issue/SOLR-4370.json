    "description": "We need the ability to control the hard/soft commit behaviour of commitWithin parameter.\n\nSince Solr 4.0, the commitWithin's performs a soft-commit which prevents slaves from picking up the changes in a master/slave configuration.\n\nThe behaviour I'm thinking is as follows:\n\n1.  By default, commitWithin will trigger soft commits.\n\n2.  But this behaviour can be overwritten in solrconfig.xml to allow commitWithin to perform hard commits, which will allow slaves to pick up the changes.\n\n\t<commitWithin>\n\t\t<forceHardCommit>true</forceHardCommit> <!-- default is false -->\n\t</commitWithin>\n\nRelated to SOLR-4100",

            "content": "Tested the patch on 4.2 from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/branch_4x/ and found a couple issues when solr.commitwithin.softcommit = false.  The setting allows the slaves to replicate the indices and I can see the index files updated after commitWithin timeframe.\n\nThe issues are:\n\n1/ Stats on the collection overview page doesn't get updated.  This includes the generation & version info.  An explicit commit (i.e. http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/update?commit=true) will update the stats.\n\n2/ Can't find the indexed docs on the master.  An explicit commit solves the issue.\n\nI think the patch solves the original request but introduced a couple of side-effects.\n\n\n\nAdditional info\n---------------\n\nI did a quick diff between explicit commit (commit=true) vs. commitWithin=2000 vs. HardAutoCommitTest and here's what I found.
