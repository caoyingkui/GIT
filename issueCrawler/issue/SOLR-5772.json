The only way to ensure uniqueness (when updating) is to always have a sub-document even if this does not reflect your data. \n\nThis is especially inconvenient since the \"empty\" child document must have an id field since it is a required field.\n\nI also found this unanswered StackOverflow post that shows another user seeing this bug:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/23881343/index-nested-document-cause-unique-key-duplication "
