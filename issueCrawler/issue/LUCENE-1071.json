    "description": "In the new optimized code in SegmentMerger the payload bit is not set correctly\nin the merged segment. This means that we loose all payloads during a merge!\n\nThe Payloads unit test doesn't catch this. Now that we have the new\nDocumentsWriter we buffer much more docs by default then before. This means\nthat the test cases can't assume anymore that the DocsWriter flushes after 10\ndocs by default. TestPayloads however falsely assumed this, which means that no\nmerges happen anymore in TestPayloads. We should check whether there are\nother testcases that rely on this.\n\nThe fixes for TestPayloads and SegmentMerger are very simple, I'll attach a patch\nsoon.",
