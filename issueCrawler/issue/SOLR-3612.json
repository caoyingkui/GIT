    "description": "This affects example 3 from the wiki. It seems there is a race here, and at one time the config just happened to upload fast enough? Now, sometimes other instances in the ensemble try to load the config faster than it is uploaded and cannot find key files (solrconfig, schema). Not sure I have a great simple solution right now, but at minimum I can add in a wait of 10 seconds or so - and add some buffer time. A better solution could come later.",
