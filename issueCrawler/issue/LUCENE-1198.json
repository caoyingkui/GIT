To do this, I\nadded this method to IndexWriter:\n\n  boolean testPoint(String name)\n\nThen in DocumentsWriter.ThreadState.init I added this:\n\n  assert writer.testPoint(\"DocumentsWriter.ThreadState.init start\");\n\nThen, tests can subclass IndexWriter and do interesting things at each\nof these test points.  We can add further test points over time...\n\nThen I fixed the issue and the tests (& all tests) pass.  I'll commit\nin a day or two. ",
