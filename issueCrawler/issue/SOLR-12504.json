    "description": "SOLR-11216 solved many cases in the PeerSync (in doing recovery). But there are still cases when PeerSync will fail because of mismatch in fingerprint comparison. The main reason here is fingerprint and recent versions of leader is not computed/retrieved in an atomic way. \n\nFor example: when an update made into leader's tlog after fingerprint is computed but before recent versions are retrieved.\nLeader's fingerprint          : (contains updates from 1-10)\nLeader's recent versions : (contains updates from 1-12)\nReplica's fingerprint        :  (contains updates from 1-12)\n--> A mismatch in fingerprint between leader and replica.\n\nBut it seems that blocking updates in leader for getVersions operation is not a good idea (it will degrade indexing performance). Still struggling on finding a solution.",
