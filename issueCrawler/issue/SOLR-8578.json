I think that we put a Writer around the outputstream. We can't and don't want to close it, that will close the outputstream. We can't do nothing or everything stays in the buffer. So we flush. I think that causes Jetty to use chunked encoding. I think what we would like to do is Writer#flushBuffer, but it's package protected. Binary just doesn't have this Writer issue. ",
