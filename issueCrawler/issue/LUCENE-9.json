    "description": "I think there's \"ideo-logic\" error in QueryParser:\n  (and in BooleanQuery!)\n\n  when I search for smth. like \"love OR NOT onion\"\n  I receive the same result as I search for \"love AND NOT onion\".\n  IMHO it's wrong.\n\n  Let we have 4 docs:\n  doc1: \"Love is life\"\n  doc2: \"Java is pretty nice language\"\n  doc3: \"C++ is powerful, but unsafe\"\n  doc4: \"Onion and love sometimes are not compatoble\"\n\n  So, if search for \"love OR NOT onion\"\n  result must be: doc1, doc2, doc3.\n  (everything where the word \"onion\" isn't present, because we say \"OR\")\n\n  but, we have the same result as in case of search for:\n  \"love AND NOT onion\":\n  result: doc1.\n\n\n  So, I have created own parser, using BooleanQuery, that would help\n  me, but unfortunatelly it wouldn't.\n\n  Please ! Fix it ASAYK !",
