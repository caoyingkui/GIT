    "description": "I try to use the CharArraySet for a filter I am writing. I heavily use char-arrays in my code to speed up things. I stumbled upon a bug in CharArraySet while doing that.\n\nThe method public boolean contains(char[] text, int off, int len) seems not to work.\n\nWhen I do \n\n\nif (set.contains(buffer,offset,length) {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nmy code fails.\n\nBut when I do\n\n\nif (set.contains(new String(buffer,offset,length)) {\n   ...\n}\n\n\n\neverything works as expected.\n\nBoth variants should behave the same. I attach a small piece of code to show the problem.",

I will commit shortly. ",
