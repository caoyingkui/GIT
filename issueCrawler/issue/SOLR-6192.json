User reported that adding a document via the admin UI resulted in the document appearing twice in the results lists.\n\nInsuring that documents added via the admin UI are \"cloud-aware\" seems like a Good Thing. That said, I'm not entirely sure it's worth the effort. If we're going to make the admin screens cloud-aware in general, there are a number of changes necessary.",
