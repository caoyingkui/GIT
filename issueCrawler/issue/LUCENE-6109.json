If the user list discussion results in an \nagreement that it's worth a JIRA, then open one.\n\n\nIn this case, what I expect you're seeing is that a searcher\nkeeps files open until the searcher is closed. Segment\nfiles can be \"merged away\" during indexing, but the deleted\nfiles are still kept around until the searcher using them closes.\n\nSo, I expect these files will disappear when you do a hard commit\nwith openSearcher=true. And other ones will appear, then that\nspecific set of files will go away a little while after the next hard\ncommit (openSearcher=true).\n\nIf this is not your experience, please show full outputs before and\nafter, and specify what you expect the difference to be on the\nuser's list. If there's really a problem we can re-open this JIRA.\n\n "
