    "description": "Michelle Talley reported a problem on the user w/ distributed search .. root issue isn't understood yet, but a secondary problem was that when adding \"debugQuery=true\" this NPE was thrown...\n\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.apache.solr.common.util.NamedList.nameValueMapToList(NamedList.java:110)\n        at org.apache.solr.common.util.NamedList.&lt;init&gt;(NamedList.java:75)\n        at org.apache.solr.common.util.SimpleOrderedMap.&lt;init&gt;(SimpleOrderedMap.java:58)\n        at org.apache.solr.handler.component.DebugComponent.finishStage(DebugComponent.java:130)\n\n\n\nthe cause evidently relating to a mismatch between the rb.resultIds list of ShardDocs, and the score explanation output from each shard.  The pattern of code in DebugComponent is common among several components, and i think we should \"fix\" NamedList to ignore nulls in it's Map.Entry<String, T>[] constructor",
