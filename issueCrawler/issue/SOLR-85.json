            "content": "Well this issue can be seen as enabler for SOLR-66.\n\nEspecially the upload part.\n@Yonik, yes the commons-fileupload.jar handles the multi-part posts:\n\nServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(factory);\n            // Parse the request\n            List iter;\n            try \n{\n                iter = upload.parseRequest(request);\n            }\n catch (FileUploadException e) \n{\n                throw new IOException(\n                        \"FileUploadException\\nStack: \"\n                                + e);\n            }\n\nWe then  wrap the file and open an input stream, which we pass to the core. \nInputStream stream = item.getInputStream();\ncommandReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));\ncore.update(commandReader, responseWriter);\n\nI reckon we could test the mime-type  of the file before posting it to the core.update.\nThis way we can generate xml out of csv like in SOLR-66.\n\nSo instead making SOLR-66 a servlet on its on it should become something like a solr.input.plugin. A input plugin is code that is transforming incoming input to solr internal xml markup used fo updates.\n\nNow lets assume the csv has a register input plugin then we need to change \ncore.update(commandReader, responseWriter);\nto something like\nInputPlugin plugin = core.lookupPlugin(stream);\ncore.update(plugin.getReader(), responseWriter);\n\nThe lookup would be done done via a register that contains all input plugins and their mime-type pairs. This way one can imagine not only cvs or xml as input data. Imagine one want to use a SQL backend to update solr, with a sql input plugin that would become an easy task.\n\nthe only hard thing is how to auto determine (configure) the plugins used for certain streams. As a workaround one could add the plugin as input parameter.\n\nWDYT? "

For example, if you had:\n\n <requestHandler name=\"/admin/form\" class=\"...FormRequestHandler\" >\n   <lst name=\"invariants\">\n    <str name=\"wt\">raw</str> \n   </lst>\n   <lst name=\"forms\">\n    <str name=\"/update/xml\">forms/update/xml.html</str> \n    <srr name=\"/update/csv\">forms/update/csv.html</str> \n   </lst>\n </requestHandler>\n\nhitting:\n http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/form?path=/update/xml\n\nreturns the html sitting in ${solr.home}/conf/forms/update/xml.html\n\nIt replaces ${path} with the registered path.\n\n\n\t- - - - - -\n\n\n\nSince the admin RequestHandler config scheme gets pretty unruly if you have to configure it is solrconfig.xml, I added a flag to the <admin> section to set where you want all the standard ones\n\n<admin>\n  <registerStandardHandlers>/admin</registerStandardHandlers>\n  ...\n</admin>\n\nIf you put \"false\" it will not register the default paths.  It will not overwrite any existing paths either.  that is, if you manually register,  \"/admin/file\" it will not put in the default one\n\n\n\n\t- - - -\n\n\n\nThe AdminHandlersSetupHelper automatically finds forms in the conf/forms/ directory that match registered handlers and registers them with the FormRequestHandler.  \n\n\n\t- - - - -\n\n\n\nI'm putting this up mostly for a sanity check.  If you like the direction, i'll add more comments, documentation and clean things up.\n\nthanks "

Since the update command is not fixed to /update and we also want to support /update/csv, we need some way to deal with that.\n\nI think the best option would be to configure the admin links from solrconfig.xml.  perhaps something like:\n\n<admin>\n     <defaultQuery>solr</defaultQuery>\n     <header>\n       <links name=\"solr\">\n         <link name=\"Schema\"   path=\"/admin/file?file=schema.xml\" />\n         <link name=\"Config\"   path=\"/admin/file?file=solrconfig.xml\" />\n         <link name=\"Analysis\" path=\"/admin/analysis.jsp\" />\n         <br/>\n         <link name=\"Statistics\"   path=\"/admin/stats.jsp\" />\n         <link name=\"Info\"         path=\"/admin/registry.jsp\" />\n         <link name=\"Distribution\" path=\"/admin/distributiondump.jsp\" />\n         <link name=\"Ping\"         path=\"/admin/ping\" />\n         <link name=\"Logging\"      path=\"/admin/logging.jsp\" />\n       </links>\n       <links name=\"update\">\n         <link name=\"Update\" path=\"/admin/?show=update.html\" />\n         <link name=\"CSV\"    path=\"/admin/?show=updatecsv.html\" />\n       </links>\n       <links name=\"App server\">\n         <link name=\"Properties\"   path=\"/admin/properties\" />\n         <link name=\"Thread Dump\"  path=\"/admin/threaddump.jsp\" />\n       </links>\n     </header>\n    ... \n\n\ncheck: http://www.nabble.com/-jira--Created%3A-%28SOLR-142%29-RawResponseWriter---replace--admin-get-file.jsp-tf3176309.html#a10235374 "
