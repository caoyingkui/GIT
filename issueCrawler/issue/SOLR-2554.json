(or ever could have in any previous release) \n\nI did some very basic testing with the example solr configs on trunk and i can not reproduce...\n\nstarting solr up clean, loading the sample data and then executing these queries...\n\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=*%3A*&sort=random_foo+asc\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=*%3A*&sort=random_bar+asc\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=*%3A*&sort=random_yak+asc\n\n\n\n...i got three different orderings, but when i then checked http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/stats.jsp#cache i verified that fieldCache was empty.\n\nIf you get different results, please re-open and be specific about the version of solr you are using, the steps to reproduce, and the info about fieldCache that you get back from stats.jsp "
