    "description": "Query strings that contain a single quote, properly escaped, break as soon as you add a sort field.\n\nFor example,\nIf  I want to search for the word ----   jam's   ---- \nincluding the single quote, I can.  But as soon as I add a sort criteria to the URL, it breaks.\n\nNote: %27 is a single quote encoded for URI's\n\nHere's the examples....\nhttp://10.0.101.11:8080/forsale/select/?q=jam%27s    \u2013 this works (i get ~20 hits back)\nhttp://10.0.101.11:8080/forsale/select/?q=jam%27s;score%20desc \u2014 this doesn't (get 0 hits back)\n\nSeems that if the first query works, it shouldn't be breakable just by telling it explicitly to sort on score??  All other sorts break in this scenario as well ( i.e., price, etc).\n\nemail rsp from Yonik:\nHmmm, Solr tries to be smart about splitting the query from the sort\nspecification.\nIf it sees a semicolon inside quotes (single or double), or backslash\nescaped, then it will treat it as part of the query.\n\nAn immediate workaround would be to query for \"jam's\" or jam\\'s\n\nIt would be helpful if you could open a JIRA issue for this.",

Details as follows:\n\nI applied the patch (split_sort.txt)\n\nI then recompiled this version:  apache-solr-1.1.0-incubating\n\nusing: ant compile then ant dist\n\nI then copied:\n/opt/apache-solr-1.1.0-incubating/dist/apache-solr-1.1.1-dev-incubating.war\n\nas solr.war, and deployed it via tomcat.\n\nUnfortunately, i could not find any differences in behaviour.\n\nIf I search for anything, and add a 's  (apostrophe s) AND use a sort (i.e.,\n;price or whatever) it returns me no hits.  I did notice that with both pre\nand post patched .war file, if you use an escape char (as u recommended) i.e.,\n\\'s it will work.\n\nMaybe i didn't do something right, not sure.  Thanks for the patch though,\nlet me know if you would like me to try another. "
