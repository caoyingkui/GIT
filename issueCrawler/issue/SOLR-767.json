I think the intent was to report how many were returned, which may differ from rows (albeit, it can only ever be the same as rows or less).  Don't know if that is useful or not.  I would suspect, like you did, Yonik, that most people think it should return the number of matches not just those that are returned.\n\nAn alternative would be to add a \"matches\" or \"totalMatches\" log entry and keep hits.  \n\nSo +0.
