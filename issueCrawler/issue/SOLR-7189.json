Until Tika 1.7, the off-the-shelf handlers concatenated the content of embedded documents but didn't maintain the embedded documents' metadata.  \n\nDo you think there would be interest in adding a parameter to DIH to create individual child documents for embedded documents and maintain their metadata?  Separate issue, of course. ",

And it should be exposed through inner entity mechanism, so people could start with a list of file names for zips, then expand the zips, then process individual files, etc.\n\nBut yes, it should be a separate issue. And I would definitely create it so the people are even aware of this new functionality. ",
