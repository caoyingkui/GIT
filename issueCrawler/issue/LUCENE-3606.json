This code is so hairy and buggy (as investigated by Robert and Mike today) when you work on SegmentReader level but forget to flush in the DirectoryReader, so its better to really make IndexReaders readonly.\n\nCurrently with IndexReader you can do things like:\n\n\tdelete/undelete Documents -> Can be done by with IndexWriter, too (using deleteByQuery)\n\tchange norms -> this is a bad idea in general, but when we remove norms at all and replace by DocValues this is obsolete already. Changing DocValues should also be done using IndexWriter in trunk (once it is ready)",

With IW you have to\n    do an NRT reopen instead.\n\n\n\n\n\tDelete by docID... users seem to use/want this (eg ask from time\n    to time if we can do this in IW, which we can't since merging can\n    shift docIDs at any time).\n\n\n\n\n\tIR tells you how many documents were affected by a delete-by-Term.\n    IW cannot, since it buffers and only resolves all deletes in bulk\n    later.\n\n\n\nNow... just because IR can do these things that IW cannot.... doesn't\nmean they are compelling / important.  Ie maybe no app out there\nrelies on these special things and so we can lose this functionality?\nI'm not sure...\n\nOn removing IR.setNorm, I agree we should just remove it: in trunk now\nyou can make a custom sim that boost norms \"live\", so we won't lose\nany functionality.  The setNorm code (and the implications \u2013 all the\nper-field normGen, reference counting, scary SR.reopen, etc.) is truly\nhairy; would be great to nuke it all. ",

By changing from atomic to per-segment search in 2.9 we already broke lots of incorrectly implemented stuff in Lucene, and these IndexReader deletion behaviour \"features\" are far less often used than Filters tied to top-level IndexSearcher instead the IR passed to getDocIdSet().\n\nDelete by doc id is dangerous and should be prevented. But you can still do this: Create a custom Filter and do the deletion work in getDocIdSet(IndexReader) and pass it as Query to IndexWriter using ConstantScoreQuery. Using the IndexReader passed to getDocIdSet() you can do any funny things on it, just to produce valid docIds. IW will take care of deleteing them after getDocIdSet() returns.\n\nAs Robert said, with FilterIndexReader you can also delete documents without delay (same like in contrib/misc: PKIndexSplitter, MultiPassIndexSplitter) by just overlaying another Bits. To make those hidden documents disappear on disk, too use the aproach decsribed before.\n\nAnd of course, let's nuke my favourite hate-candidate: setNorms() ",

I think it's totally valid to restrict to a single DV and if you need more than one you simply use a byte variant and impl you custom decoding / encoding in your sim (that seems more performant too IMO).\n\nOnce we moved over to this new API ie. no custom norm code anymore we can actually make use of IDV directly, norms would be just another CFS file and each fields norms would just be a \"virtual\" file in the IDV CFS. All loading and writing could/would be done by the codecs IDV. \n\nYet, I think once we have this we should even go further and remove omitNorms from the Field entirely and let the similarity decide if a field has norms or not.
