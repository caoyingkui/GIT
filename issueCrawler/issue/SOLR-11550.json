    "description": "We are using the addChildDocument functionality of the solrj, along with the overwrite parameter set true. We do have configured the softCommit and hardCommit. What we are observing is that the parent document and the child document have different '_version_', along with the parent and child documents are not consecutive. Here it looks like\n\n{\n        \"id\":\"8197105\",\n        \"_version_\":1582256304742727680,\n        \"[docid]\":274136},\n      {\n        \"id\":\"10073563\",\n        \"_version_\":1582255855082930176,\n        \"[docid]\":140176},\n      {\n        \"parentId\":\"10073563\",\n        \"id\":\"10073563_8230858\",\n        \"_version_\":1582255855082930176,\n        \"[docid]\":140175},\n      {\n        \"parentId\":\"10073563\",\n        \"id\":\"10073563_8355551\",\n        \"_version_\":1582255855082930176,\n        \"[docid]\":140174},\n      {\n        \"parentId\":\"8197105\",\n        \"id\":\"8197105_8197109\",\n        \"_version_\":1582255855066152960,\n        \"[docid]\":140173},\n      {\n        \"parentId\":\"8197105\",\n        \"id\":\"8197105_8197108\",\n        \"_version_\":1582255855066152960,\n        \"[docid]\":140172}\n  }\n\n\n\nIn the above example mentioned, parentId represents the parentId of the document. While, those documents does not have the parentId represents parent document.  As per the above example, between the parent-child documents of 8197105, there is another set of parent-child document which got indexed which belong to 10073563.\n\nBecause of the above issue, BlockJoinQuery will start returning wrong results",

This  was addressed in SOLR-10114.\n\nAlthough the reason behind fixing that was re-ordered DBQ queries. \n\nWhat's the difference between this Jira and SOLR-11517  that you had filed? \n\nAlso is this reproducible ?\n ",
