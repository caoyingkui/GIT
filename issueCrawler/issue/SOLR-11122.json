    "description": "I've made the handling of core.properties more consistent as part of the pluggable transient core work. However, a new inconsistency came to light. Most of the code assumes that a core.properties file exists, but it wasn't being persisted until the very end of the coreContainer.create process. So any steps part way through core creation that would manipulate the core.properties file wouldn't find it. And if those steps did make a mistake and call persist on the core.properties, create would fail because the core.properties file would be created. Worse, the transient cache handler had no way of knowing whether the core descriptors being added were from create (where the core.properties file hadn't been created yet) or reload/swap/rename. By moving persisting the core.properties earlier in the create process this would be less trappy.\n\nAny core.properties file created during this process will be removed if the create fails.\n\nCores that are simply being loaded on the other hand do not have their core.properties files removed.",

In particular CoreContainer had two create methods, one strictly internal and one public both called \"create\". I renamed the private one to createFromDescriptor.\n\nAlso added a getTransientCacheHandler into CoreContainer so it can be easily retrieved from outside. ",

The meat of the patch is just moving creating the core descriptor earlier in CoreContainer.create and removing it on failure.\n\nAlong the way I found the fact that we had a private create method in CoreContainer that wasn't really related to the public one so I renamed it.\n\nI also beefed up the tests.
