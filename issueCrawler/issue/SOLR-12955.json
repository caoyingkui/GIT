            "content": "Thanks Bar Rotstein for looking into refactoring DUP. \n\nNow with CdcrURP;\n\nI am working on SOLR-12057 to deprecate CdcrURP altogether as it doesn't serve any strong purpose and eventually plans to phase out in potentially 8.0 or later. A single protected method is required to be extended in CdcrURP from DURP i.e. filterParams(SolrParams..). I am attaching the potential code for CdcrURP for reference:\n\n/**\n * <p>\n * Extends {@link org.apache.solr.update.processor.DistributedUpdateProcessor},\n * and attach the _version_ from the update to the doc,\n * for synchronizing checkpoints b/w clusters.\n * This URP to be added at target cluster in uni-directional\n * and all clusters involved in bi-directional sync.\n * </p>\n */\npublic class CdcrUpdateProcessor extends DistributedUpdateProcessor {\n\n  public static final String CDCR_UPDATE = \"cdcr.update\";\n\n  public CdcrUpdateProcessor(SolrQueryRequest req, SolrQueryResponse rsp, UpdateRequestProcessor next) {\n    super(req, rsp, next);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * <p>\n   * Method to check if cdcr forwarded update.\n   * If yes, attach the _version_ from the update to the doc,\n   * for synchronizing checkpoint b/w clusters\n   * </p>\n   */\n  protected ModifiableSolrParams filterParams(SolrParams params) {\n    ModifiableSolrParams result = super.filterParams(params);\n    if (params.get(CDCR_UPDATE) != null) {\n      result.set(CDCR_UPDATE, \"\");\n      result.set(CommonParams.VERSION_FIELD, params.get(CommonParams.VERSION_FIELD));\n    }\n    return result;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nSo whichever class out of the two has the protected filterParams(...), we need to extend the CdcrURP with that particular class I believe; as CDCR is a strict SolrCloud feature.\n\nThe patch for SOLR-12057 is almost ready and waiting for final review. Hope this helps. ",

Will it continue to work as before and just log a deprecation warning? If they upgrade to a new major version and don't change to the appropriate new class, would their core(s) fail to start?  Those two courses of action would be IMHO the best way to go. ",
