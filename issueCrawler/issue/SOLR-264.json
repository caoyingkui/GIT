The special keyword 'score' already makes me a bit nervous.  It seems like you could make a field named score, but could not sort by it and could not refer to it (except as *)\n\n\n> Since this is such a unique requirement (probably not broadly applicable)\n\nIs it so unique?  In 'full text search' sure, but if the domain is 'database' it seems pretty fundamental.  I can't be the only person who wants to do:\n\n SELECT * FROM features ORDER BY rand();\n\n fq=feature:true&sort=random "
