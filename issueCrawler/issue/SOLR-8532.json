    "description": "the current graph query implementation always collects edges.  When a maxDepth is specified, there is an obvious optimization to not collect edges at the maxDepth level.  \n\nIn addition there are some other memory optimizations that I'd like to merge in.  I have an updated version that includes the above optimization, in addition, there are some memory optimizations that can be applied if returnRoot != false.  In that, It doesn't need to hold on to the original docset that matched the root nodes of the query.  \n\nI will be posting the patch in the next few days.",
