But this order seemed better because it means we only have to audit the list one time, w/o any time pressure and w/o the list continually growing as people resolve more 6.1 issues.\n\n(S6 should also catch these issues, but i wanted redundency since it's possible people made issue# typos in the git commit messages)\n\nI've updated the steps in the issue description accordingly.\n "

It appears that it spins up a background thread that iterates over every individual issue in the background and change them, causing concurrent queries you try from the browser for the \"old\" version to slowly see decreasing results over time, until evnetually there are no results found, and then the old version disappears from the list of Verions.  \n\nIn fact: If you view \"All\" Activity for any of the issues that use to be assocaited with the (old) 'master' version, it says i edited the fixVersion and changed it to 6.0, and it says the \"updated\" date for all of these issues is \"Just now\"\n "
