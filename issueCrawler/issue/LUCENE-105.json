    "description": "When parsing HTML code \" abc</td><dt>xyz \" the HTML parser skips over elements \nand concatenates text around them without separating them with white space, in \nthat case producing abcxyz.  Searching resulting index will not be able to find \nthe abc.\n\nAt least for tags <td>, <p>, <br>, <blockquote>, <dt>, <h1> - <h6>, <li>, and \n<q> the parser should separate string on both sides of tags with space.  Using \nsquare brackets \"[\", or \"]\" for separating gthe strings will also work as it is \nalready used for text in ALT attribute of images.\n\nThere is a workaround for this bug to add spaces when authoring HTML code, but \nthat may not always be done if documents are created by somebody else.",
