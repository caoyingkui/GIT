            "content": "There are severe bugs that happen in Lucene when using IBM's Java.  I seem to recall seeing something indicating that IBM is starting to take them seriously, but that might have been wishful thinking.\n\nIt will be quite a while after IBM fixes the problem (if they ever do) before there is widespread penetration of fixed Java versions, so until that happens, the fact that bin/solr doesn't work right might actually be a good thing.\n\nAs I understand it, the J9 problems occur because IBM is extremely aggressive at turning on optimizations in the JVM.  The performance of IBM's Java is legendary as a result of this, but it also causes a lot of problems.\n\nI know that in at least one case of a bug with J9, there is an optimization that can be turned off to fix the problem ... there may be other bugs fixed by turning off certain optimizations.\n\nAs an initial step, I was thinking about having the startup script detect J9 versions and abort with a message indicating serious JVM bugs (perhaps linking to the JavaBugs page on the Lucene wiki).  We already have detection for Java 7u40 through 7u51, which enables the -XX:-UseSuperWord option for Java and prints a warning to the user about upgrading Java.\n\nAs we learn more, we could start with commandline options to work around the problems, and then if IBM ever actually fixes the problems, run normally with those detected versions.\n\nThe java version detection currently happens in the script, which I think may be a little fragile.  Perhaps a tiny little Java program could be written to detect a whole range of information about the JVM and return one or more known strings back to the script to tell the script what to do .  Those actions might include aborting because the java version is not new enough, issuing a warning because it's not 64-bit, turning on X and/or Y commandline options, etc.  We might even be able to set the max heap according to the available memory, but do so less aggressively than Java itself does.\n\nThis comment turned into quite a lot of text!  I started off just writing a quick note about J9 bugs. ",

            "content": "Thanks Shawn. I actually started to work with th j9 team over the past few weeks, on different aspects such as establishing a process for us to report bugs and have them rub Lucene/Solr tests on j9 builds in order to detect JVM issues. The team is also in contact with Uwe and Robert, and it seems like things get in the right direction.\n\nThe issues that are known to cause corruption are suspected to have been fixed, but since they were not reproducible with the latest j9 builds, we can't say it for sure. Therfore the warnings are still found in the JavaBugs page, but I assume that after we have Jenkins passing builds for a while, we will at least document that these issues were not reproduced with version X and onwards. \n\nAs for this particular issue I think that we should have bin/solr successfully start on j9. The problem that I've fixed is just passing the right gc log flag, which is different in j9.\n\nWith this patch, we have a way to also detect particular build versions and block them if we know they are bad. I don't think the blocking j9 entirely is a good solution though, and definitely the script currently doesn't explicitly block j9, it just fails with a wrong flag passed error.\n\nFrom a community perspective, I feel that blocking a JVM vendor entirely is wrong, but maybe I'm biased. At least I can confirm that the team gives a high priority to resolving any outstanding Lucene/Solr issues, so blocking j9 in our scripts (and code) feels wrong.  ",

Also this page which they pointed me at does not indicate any additional parameters are needed: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.win.80.doc/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xverbosegclog.html.\n\nThe removed line (replaced with the if/else construct) uses parentheses to combine the old with the new,\n\nYou're right. At first I thought that the parentheses don't work because when I echoed them using echo $GC_LOG_OPTS it only printed the -verbose:gc. I now tried echo \"${GC_LOG_OPTS[@]}\" and it works.
