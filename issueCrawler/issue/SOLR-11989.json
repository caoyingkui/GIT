    "description": "Today replicas are placed according to policy rules but there is no way to drive the number of replicas based on policy e.g.\n\nExample 1: Put a replica of each shard of collection A on each node in the cluster\n\n{\"replica\":\">0\", \"node\", \"#ANY\", \"shard\" : \"#EACH\", \"collection\" : \"A\"}\n\n\nExample 2: Put a replica of each shard of collection A on every nodes with sysprop.region=east\n\n{\"replica\":\">0\", \"sysprop.region\", \"east\", \"shard\" : \"#EACH\", \"collection\" : \"A\"}\n\n\n\nThe above two rules can be used to compute the replication factor of collection A but today the replicationFactor parameter passed in collection/shard creation neither takes the rule into account nor does it prevent conflicts. In fact, the replicationFactor should be omitted while creating collection A if the above rules are present.",
