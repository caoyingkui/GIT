    "description": "Spinoff from SOLR-3843.\n\nWe should clean up dependencies tests here: so that solr-core.jar does not depend on things it really doesnt depend on.\n\nInstead the webapp can depend on this. Also it would be good to move the example tests to something like webapp/, so solr-core.jar isn't depending on analyzers it really needs just because some tests use configs with them and so on.",
