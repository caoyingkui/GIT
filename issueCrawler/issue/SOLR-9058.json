            "content": "This patch fixes up both hashJoin and outerHashJoin and adds tests for the scenario to both. \n\nThe approach taken is to have a left and right list of fields to hash on. During construction it checks for an = in the field and if found will split into a left and right side field name. If not found then it uses that single field name for both the left and right side. It then uses those lists when reading tuples from the stream.\n\nStephan Osthold, good catch on this one and thank you for the test showing the failure (I swiped that and included it in the test case).
