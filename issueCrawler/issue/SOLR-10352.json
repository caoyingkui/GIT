    "description": "We should add a warning in the startup script for Linux, if the output of the following is below a certain threshold (maybe 300?). The warning could indicate that features like UUIDField, SSL etc. might not work properly (or be slow). As a hint, we could then suggest the user to configure a non blocking SecureRandom (SOLR-10338) or install rng-tools, haveged etc.\n\n\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n\nOriginal discussion:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-10338?focusedCommentId=15938904&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15938904",

So let me know if this is not the point .. \n\nI think it is a valid point that entropy might run out also in production not just in test suites. Just came to my mind what if we had non-blocking SecureRandom as a default in the startup scripts. And - if overwritten - the warning could give the feedback to the user.\n\nI think this link was cited in one of the issues.

LIkewise if there is \"high\" entropy on startup that doesn't mean everything will be fine and there's nothing to worry about: the available entropy could drop over time and cause performance issues later.\n\nRather then warning about this in bin/solr I feel like this type of information should be exposed by the solr metrics code, so people can easily monitor it over the life of the solr server process \u2013 either via a command line script we could provide, or via JMX, or via the admin UI ... we could even consider putting incorporating some specific \"node health\" metrics (entropy level, max open files, free disk, etc...) directly into the main screen of the Admin UI along with specific warnings/suggestions such as the text this issue added about SSL & UUIDField.

            "content": "Hoss Man, I think it is a good point that entropy could, in theory, go up and down over the course of the life of a Solr process. In practice, a host with high entropy (say baremetal) continues to remain in high entropy available state; and low entropy hosts (say VMs) continue to remain in a low entropy mode. So, although in theory a system could get in and out of the diminished available entropy state, in practice, afaik, a good system remains good and a bad one remains bad. Hence, a startup warning feels like a sensible thing to throw out there.\n\nRather then warning about this in bin/solr I feel like this type of information should be exposed by the solr metrics code, so people can easily monitor it over the life of the solr server process\nI feel that a start up warning should definitely be thrown, since we already know that there will be a problem. Having metrics support and UI warning is a great idea. However, I think we should do both (startup warning and metrics/UI warning). ",
