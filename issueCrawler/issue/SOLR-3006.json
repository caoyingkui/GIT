    "description": "If there's a problem in analyzer config or for example some mandatory attribute is missing from fieldType definition the resulting exception is not currently shown on log (console).\n\nThe only thing visible, logged two times, is this:\n\n\nSEVERE: Could not start Solr. Check solr/home property and the logs\norg.apache.solr.common.SolrException: No cores were created, please check the logs for errors\n\n\n\nIf I load the solr web page it shows the actual error(s). It would be nice if the problem was also logged on console/log.\n\nThere's some suspicious looking lines in AbstractPluginLoader at around line 169:\n\n\n          SolrException e = new SolrException\n            (ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR,\n             \"Plugin init failure for \" + type + \":\" + ex.getMessage(), ex);\n\n\nwhere the SolrException is created with a constructor that sets the logged flag to true. Still there is a line\n\n          SolrException.logOnce(log,null,e);\n\n\n\na little later.",
