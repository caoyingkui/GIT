    "description": "the TermHistogram class in the LukeRequestHandler seems to properly count the occurances of terms with a freq of \"1\", but then when converting to a NamedLIst begins iterating at bucket \"2\" so the counts for freq of \"1\" don't appear in the result.\n\nthis may have been a conscious choice to eliminate superfluously high values for terms with a freq of one ... or it may have been a mistake assuming freq values of 1 would fall in the \"2\" bucket.",
