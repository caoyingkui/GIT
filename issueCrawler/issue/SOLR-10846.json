    "description": "FileFloatSource (and by extension ExternalFileField) currently throws an NPE if the keyField is Points based.\n\nThis seems to be due to hardcoded assumptions about MultiFields.getTerms(...) returning a non-null value for the keyField (which I suspect could also lead to an NPE in situations where the index is completley empty? ... not sure)\n\nIn general, the error handling in FileFloatSource should be improved. \n\nIf there is no straight forward way to make FileFloatSource work with Point fields, then ExternalFileField should throw a clear error on init if the true==keyFieldType.isPointField()",
