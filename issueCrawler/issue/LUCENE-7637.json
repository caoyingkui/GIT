    "description": "Spin-off from LUCENE-7624. Requiring that all terms are in the same field would make things simpler and more consistent with other queries. It might also make it easier to improve this query in the future since other similar queries like AutomatonQuery also work on the per-field basis. The only downside is that querying terms across multiple fields would be less efficient, but this does not seem to be a common use-case.",
