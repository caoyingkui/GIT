    "description": "Forbidden-Apis 2.2 was released an hour ago: https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis/wiki/Changes\n\nThis version supports/fixes the following important stuff:\n\n\tcommons-io signatures for 2.5; also update/review older commons-io signatures. This has shown new test bugs in Solr (using FileUtils.write(File, CharSequence), using default charset). The patch will fix this. It will also revert the workaround for the missing 2.5 signatures file added by SOLR-9147.\n\tallows to forbid signature polymorphic methods (e.g., slow MethodHandle.invoke(...) when used instead of MethodHandle.invokeExact(...) (thanks Robert Muir!)\n\tWorks around a bug in Gradle's Spyware Daemon (not Lucene/Solr relevant).\n\n\n\nI will post & commit patch soon",

It leaks classloaders like hell and corrumpts my system. So I have a global config file to disable it!\n\nIt's basically this issue: https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis/pull/76 "
