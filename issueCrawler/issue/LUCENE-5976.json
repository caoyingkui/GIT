    "description": "Right now, index upgrader produces one gigantic segment.  This can take a long time, consume more memory than normal merges, and even sidestep the max seg size for the delegated MergePolicy.\n\nIt would be nice to have a simpler option: create 1 upgraded segment for every existing segment.  If there are deletes that are merged away, the regulard MP can takeover after the upgrade is complete (or even partially complete) to merge away deletes.",
