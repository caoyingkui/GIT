    "description": "(Aside: where is the documentation on how to mark up text in jira comments?)\n\nThe following things are left over after LUCENE-584 :\n\nFor Lucene 3.0  Filter.bits() will have to be removed.\n\nThere is a CHECKME in IndexSearcher about using ConjunctionScorer to have the boolean behaviour of a Filter.\n\nI have not looked into Filter caching yet, but I suppose there will be some room for improvement there.\nIirc the current core has moved to use OpenBitSetFilter and that is probably what is being cached.\nIn some cases it might be better to cache a SortedVIntList instead.\n\nBoolean logic on DocIdSetIterator is already available for Scorers (that inherit from DocIdSetIterator) in the search package. This is currently implemented by ConjunctionScorer, DisjunctionSumScorer,\nReqOptSumScorer and ReqExclScorer.\nBoolean logic on BitSets is available in contrib/misc and contrib/queries\n\nDisjunctionSumScorer calls score() on its subscorers before the score value actually needed.\nThis could be a reason to introduce a DisjunctionDocIdSetIterator, perhaps as a superclass of DisjunctionSumScorer.\n\nTo fully implement non scoring queries a TermDocIdSetIterator will be needed, perhaps as a superclass of TermScorer.\n\nThe javadocs in org.apache.lucene.search using matching vs non-zero score:\nI'll investigate this soon, and provide a patch when necessary.\n\nAn early version of the patches of LUCENE-584 contained a class Matcher,\nthat differs from the current DocIdSet in that Matcher has an explain() method.\nIt remains to be seen whether such a Matcher could be useful between\nDocIdSet and Scorer.\n\nThe semantics of scorer.skipTo(scorer.doc()) was discussed briefly.\nThis was also discussed at another issue recently, so perhaps it is wortwhile to open a separate issue for this.\n\nSkipping on a SortedVIntList is done using linear search, this could be improved by adding multilevel skiplist info much like in the Lucene index for documents containing a term.\n\nOne comment by me of 3 Dec 2008:\n\nA few complete (test) classes are deprecated, it might be good to add the target release for removal there.",
