    "description": "I have indexed documents with fileds named like fulltext_[some id].\nI'm testing highlighting on document which have only one that field, fulltext_1234.\nWhen 'fulltext_*' is provided as hl.fl, QTime is horribly big (> 10s), when explicit 'fulltext_1234' is provided, QTime is acceptable (~30ms).\nI've found that using widlcards in hl.fl can increase QTime ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11774508/optimize-solr-highlighter), but it definitly should not cost so much.\n\nI'm using fastVectorHighliter in both cases.",
