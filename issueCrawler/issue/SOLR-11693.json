I can reproduce this issue with a Solr instance in both 6.6.2 and 7.1.0.\n\nI can't reproduce it when I run the triggering file within Solr's unit tests or with straight Tika. \n\nWould anyone with more knowledge of classloading within Solr be able to help?\n\nSee TIKA-2497 for triggering file and conf files.\n\n...turns out this is a bug in POI 3.16 and 3.17-beta1",
