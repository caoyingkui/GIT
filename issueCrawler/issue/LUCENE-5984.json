    "description": "I would like to suggest removing ChainedFilter. It is currently only used in Solr's CurrencyField but could easily be replaced with a BooleanFilter and my understanding of this filter is that it can generally be replaced with a BooleanFilter. So let's drop it and suggest using BooleanFilter instead?",

Changelog misses this and there maybe other users which use this Filter, e.g. myself - it's not only used in Solr, it maybe used in users code too.\nAt least deprecating it in 4.x to know this would have been nice to know this is coming. Maybe you can add it to the Changes.txt for 5.0.x? ",
