    "description": "I was trying to create a collection on a Solrcloud deployed along with kerberized Hadoop cluster. I kept on getting following error,\n\norg.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.HttpSolrServer$RemoteSolrException:Error CREATEing SolrCore 'orders_shard1_replica2': Unable to create core [orders_shard1_replica2] Caused by: Lock obtain timed out: org.apache.solr.store.hdfs.HdfsLockFactory$HdfsLock@451997e1\n\nOn careful analysis of logs, I realized it was due to Solr not being able to talk to HDFS properly because of following error,\n\njavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target\n\nWe should improve the error handling such that we return the root-cause of the error (in this case SSLHandshakeException instead of lock timeout exception).",
