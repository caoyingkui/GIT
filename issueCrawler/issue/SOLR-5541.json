This method was adding to an in memory cache that holds all the queries that were in the elevation xml file.\n\nThis approach would cause a memory leak when doing large scale query elavation, which this patch is designed to support.\n\nThis patch stops piggy backing that convenience method and adds a new method that doesn't interact with the elevation cache.
