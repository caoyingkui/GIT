    "description": "I'm seeing some odd results when specifying \"shardId\" parameter. I'm trying the 4-node, 2-shard example from the Wiki and specifying shardIds like this:\n\ndir       shardId     start order    runnng ZK   port\nexample     1           1               y        8983\nexample2    2           2               y        7574\nexample3    1           3               y        8900\nexample4    2           4               y        7500 \n\nAnd I'm waiting a bit between starting various examples to let ZK settle down.\n\nOnce all of them are started, I was looking at http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud?view=graph to check out what that looks like (pretty cool IMO, especially since I didn't have to do it). The problem was that shard 2 only reported a single instance, while shard1 showed the two instances I was expecting. I'm running with 3 embedded ZK instances, just for yucks. Interestingly the node that didn't show up was the only node that was NOT running ZK.\n\nWhen I removed all the \"shardId\" parameters, nuked zoo_data from all directories and just started them up (with numShards=2 on the bootstrap ZK node), all 4 nodes showed up just fine.\n\nWhen starting with shardId specified and trying to go straight to the admin interface on the node that wasn't showing up, I'd get odd errors like \"This interface requires that you activate the admin request handlers, add the following configuration to your solrconfig.xml:\". I also couldn't search directly on that machine, \"http://localhost:7574/solr/select?q=:\" returns a 404 error.\n\nCommand starting server that's giving me trouble: java -Xmx1G -Djetty.port=7500 -DzkHost=localhost:9983,localhost:8574,localhost:9900 -DshardId=2 -jar start.jar\n\nCommand for one that works fine:                   java -Xmx1G -Djetty.port=8900 -DzkRun -DzkHost=localhost:9983,localhost:8574,localhost:9900 -DshardId=1 -jar start.jar\n\n\nSami Siren and he reports similar issues via e-mail conversation. Sami says that ZK 3.3.5 apparently (without exhaustive tests) fixed the problem for him, but when I tried ZK 3.3.5 I saw the same issue. Of course with all the recent stuff with Ivy, I may have screwed up when/where the JARs were.\n\nSo then I went back to ZK 3.3.4 and couldn't reproduce the problem. Which seems highly suspicious to me. It was failing every time before with 3.3.4, so it sounds like gremlins.\n\nAnd then I tried ZK 3.3.5 again (changed the ivy.xml in solrj, blew away the ZK 3.3.4, rebuilt, removed zoo_data, recopied example to three other directories)  and it works fine there too now. Siiiiggggh. Mostly this is a placeholder to insure we try this, I guarantee that sys admins will want to assign specific machines to specific shards, so this'll get used.",
