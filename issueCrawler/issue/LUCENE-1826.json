    "description": "I have a TokenStream implementation that joins together multiple sub TokenStreams (i then do additional filtering on top of this, so i can't just have the indexer do the merging)\n\nin 2.4, this worked fine.\nonce one sub stream was exhausted, i just started using the next stream \n\nhowever, in 2.9, this is very difficult, and requires copying Term buffers for every token being aggregated\n\nhowever, if all the sub TokenStreams share the same AttributeSource, and my \"concat\" TokenStream shares the same AttributeSource, this goes back to being very simple (and very efficient)\n\n\nSo for example, i would like to see the following constructor added to StandardTokenizer:\n\n  public StandardTokenizer(AttributeSource source, Reader input, boolean replaceInvalidAcronym) {\n    super(source);\n    ...\n  }\n\n\n\nwould likewise want similar constructors added to all Tokenizer sub classes provided by lucene",

The AttributeSource cannot be changed. It is created during creation of the classes (this is why it is in the ctor and nowhere else). For filters, the attributes come from the input token stream.\n\nEDIT: The TokenStream itsself is the AttributeSource, the ctor parameter AttributeSource only tells the ctor not to create new Attribute instances and reuse the maps from the given source. But Each TokenStream/Filter is always an AttributeSource itsself.\n\nIs the reflection penalty on the new TokenStream stuff incurred per root AttributeSource?, or per TokenFilter/TokenStream?\n\nThe reflection penalty is one-time per class (because of static cache of \"known\" classes), so all attributeimpl are inspected one time when a new AttributeSouce like TokenStream is created. There is an additional reflection cost, when new attributes are added, but also one time per AttributeImpl class.\nSince the last changes in TokenStream the reflection is therefore no longer a penalty. The only problem is more work to construct an TokenStream (filling the LinkedHashMaps), because of that you should reuse TokenStream-chains.\n\nthat is, if i pass the same AttributeSource to 10 TokenStreams, is the reflection cost the same as if i passed it to just one?\n\nNo change!
