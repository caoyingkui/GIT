    "description": "Lucene's highlighter capability allows for the merging of contiguous fragments.  Currently, Solr has this hard-coded to false.  The patch to follow changes this behavior to allow it to be set in the solrconfig.xml highlighter section.\n\nThis can be handled via:\n<int name=\"hl.mergeContiguous\">true</int>\n\nThe default value is false, as is the current way of doing it.",
