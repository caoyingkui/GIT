    "description": "Hello everyone.\nI was analyzing the modularization of some classes, and I identified that the class SegmentInfos has an opportunity for cohesion improvement. \nThe class IndexWriter was in the same situation and the problem was solved as follows: The IndexWriterConfig class was created, and several get() and set() methods that were used only to configure the class parameters were moved from IndexWriter to IndexWriterConfig. \nThe new class was then accessed through an instance variable in IndexWriter. This strategy has cleaned and improved IndexWriter cohesion.\nWith this in mind, I would recommend creating a new class: SegmentInfosConfig , and moving the following methods:\ngetLastCommitGeneration\ngetLastCommitSegmentsFileName\ngetSegmentsFileName\ngetNextPendingGeneration\ngetId\ngetVersion\ngetGeneration\ngetLastGeneration\nsetInfoStream\ngetInfoStream\nsetNextWriteGeneration\nsetUserData\nsetVersion\ngetCommitLuceneVersion\ngetMinSegmentLuceneVersion\nfrom the SegmentInfos.\nThose parameters accessed by an instance variable in the SegmentInfos.\nMoreover, the orthogonality is the design would be enhanced.\n\nWhat do you think about that?",
