    "description": "The core name during the persistence process is drawn from the core descriptor rather than the corecontainer, and the result is that renames are not persistent.  It would be straightforward to change this by using the same style of manipulation of core name as used in the swap admin action.\n\nIt would also be useful to change the access privileges of the name property of a CoreDescriptor so that admin handler implementations can manipulate core names directly.",

Please use this naming pattern when creating patches for uploading to JIRA. Once you create a new JIRA issue, note its name and use that name when naming your patch file. For example, if you are creating a patch for a JIRA issue named SOLR-123, then name your patch filename SOLR-123.patch. If you are creating a new version of an existing patch, use the existing patch's file name. JIRA will automatically \"gray out\" the old patch and clearly mark your newly uploaded patch as the latest.\n\nPlease delete the \"p\" patch and upload it again with proper name. "
