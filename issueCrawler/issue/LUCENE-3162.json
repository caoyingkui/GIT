Should we have a way to automatically strip these things from the source NOTICE.txt to form a release NOTICE.txt?\n\nOn the other hand, I think its confusing we don't include these jars (or at least a list of what the dependencies are) in our binary archives.\n\nCurrently a user has no way to know what any given lucene contrib depends upon, as we don't include them or even document them. See LUCENE-3009 for this bug.",
