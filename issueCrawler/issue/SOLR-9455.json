    "description": "When deleting a sub-shard after a failed split operation, the delete shard API unloads the replica cores and then deletes the shard state. But, say there were 2 replicas, if the following sequence occurs:\n\n\t1st replica got deleted\n\tfor any reason, the other replica published \"state=active\"\n\n\n\nThen the overseer can switch slice states and put parent shard as inactive and the sub-shards as active. \n\nWe should defensively update sub-shard state back to \"construction\" and only then invoke the unload action on replica cores.",
