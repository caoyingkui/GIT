    "description": "We need to define what the expected behavior of using the CoreAdminHandler's SWAP and RENAME commands is if you are running in SolrCloud mode.\n\nAt the moment, it seems to introduce a disconnect between which \"collection\" the SolrCore thinks it's a part of (and what appears in the persisted solr.xml) vs what collection ZooKeeper thinks the SolrCore(s) that were swaped/renamed are a part of.  We should either \"fix\" this, or document it if it as actually consistent and intentional for low level controls, or disable commands like SWAP/RENAME in SolrCloud mode\n\nhttps://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201209.mbox/%3CCALB4QrP2GZAwLeAiy%3DfcmOLYbc5r0i9Tp1DquyPS8mMJPwCgnw%40mail.gmail.com%3E",

            "content": "I wanted to use the RENAME feature so that the core could match a predictable name for its shard no matter which machine is hosting the shard.  This is to work-around the fact that pivot faceting isn't distributed and so I query each shard and merge, as a work-around.  Boy was using the RENAME a mistake as my collection was hosed, especially after I tried to rename the leader's core.  My attempts to delete the collection via the API failed (or at least didn't succeed within the few minutes I gave it).  So I wound up reconfiguring all my collections and related config from scratch    (on Solr 4.1) "

That means manually sending a rename/swap for each shard to properly change a distributed collection, but it may be cleaner this way ? "
