    "description": "The same problem as it was fixed in SOLR-6165 also occurs for database fields of type UUID (corresp. Java class is java.util.UUID).\n\nThe observed problem is: I import database records into the SolrCloud with DataImportHandler. In the Solr Core where the Solr document is originally imported, the UUIDs are imported correctly as strings.\n\n<str name=\"entityId\">0700a626-e9a1-42b5-801b-0546ac829020</str>\n\n\n\nBut in the replicated Solr Core the UUID got the Java class name prefixed:\n\n<str name=\"entityId\">java.util.UUID:0700a626-e9a1-42b5-801b-0546ac829020</str>",
