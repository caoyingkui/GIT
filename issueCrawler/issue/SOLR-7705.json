    "description": "Pre 4.10 If a null core name was passed in it would be handled as a bad request with error message \"No such core exists [ null ]\". From 4.10 onwards an unload call goes to CoreContainer unload where the first action taken is removing the core from coreInitFailures which throws when given null and instead of returning the expected BadRequest \"Cannot unload non-existent core [null]\" it returns InternalServerError \"java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.replaceNode(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.remove(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.apache.solr.core.CoreContainer.unload(CoreContainer.java:661)...\"\n\nThis was found due to mixing up query parameter \"name\" used in create vs \"core\" in unload. As a result this is easily reproducible with  http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=UNLOAD&name=core0",
