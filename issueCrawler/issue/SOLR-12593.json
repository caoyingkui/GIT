By default, schema-less mode is enabled which would make this change unnecessary... but if someone toggles off schema-less mode, we still want this processor to run. Can you test that this change works as intended (with and without schemaless enabled)?\nBy \"test\" here I mean to try this out manually.

Any way, nevermind as I've been trying this out.  I rescind my proposal to change the config of /extract to explicitly add processor=parse-date.  Dates are just one data type; conceptually there's the same issue with numbers and yet this content handler doesn't have special considerations for them.  I think a tip in the ref guide would be enough to suggest using the parse- related URPs to ensure dates and numbers are handled properly.\n\nI think the ref guide tutorial on this feature should be migrated from using the \"techproducts\" example config to the \"schemaless\" example config (which is really the default config).  The techproducts config doesn't even have this URP set up and I don't think it makes sense at all to use that config for this feature.  I'll post an update. ",

FWIW I held back from doing more  Alexandre Rafalovitch I know you tend to the configs so I'm hoping you can review this (or anyone of course).\n\n\tRevamped the \"Key Solr Cell Concepts\"\n\tSwitched the examples / \"trying out\" instructions from using the \"techproducts\" example config to using our default config (via -e \"schemaless\"). Why? Firstly, I observed that the techproducts config didn't have the URPs I wanted. Fixable, yes, but... Secondly, I think it simply doesn't make sense to have the \"techproducts\" config, by virtue of its name, have things other than .. you know... tech products.\n\t\n\t\tThe default configset's schema oddly does not include an \"ignored\" field type and \"ignored_*\" dynamic field. I added them. These are useful, especially with Solr Cell.\n\t\tminutia: removed the metadata name mapping of metadata \"meta\" to \"ignored_\" from the default parameters of the default configset's /update/extract request handler. I don't see the point of this and FWIW it's not in the techproducts config either. \u00a0Lets keep this config more minimal.\n\t\tThe default configset is schemaless, and so the \"try tika\" instructions were modified to recognize the fact that the metadata is all automatically added instead of how it used to be which was only those fields that happened to be in the techproducts schema. This is good but there is an awkward part in the last step of the demo if you want to not map the metadata since it requires wiping the core and starting over.\n\t\n\t\n\tAdded a tip on URPs with an example to specify these processors.\n\n ",
