    "description": "Although NumericRangeQuery will not profit much from trie-encoding short/byte fields (byte fields with e.g. precisionStep 8 would only create one precision), it may be good to have these two data types available with NumericField to be generally able to store them in prefix-encoded form in index.\n\nThis is important for loading them into FieldCache where they require much less memory.",
