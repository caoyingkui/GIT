            "content": "Patch of 30 Dec 2016.\n\nThis does not affect the syntax of surround, this only adapts the lucene side to make better use of lucene facilities that are newer than the initial version of surround.\n\nThis uses DisjunctionMaxQuery when a query specifies multiple fields.\nThe method to convert to a lucene query also allows multiple default fields.\n\nThis adds methods to BasicQueryFactory to create a new SpanNearQuery and to create a new DisjunctionMaxQuery.\n\nThis uses SpanBoostQuery when proximity (sub)queries are boosted. There is no effect on the scores yet, LUCENE-7580 can change that.\n\nThis updates the test code to use CheckHits, and one test case is added.\nThe changes to the test code form the larger part of the patch.
