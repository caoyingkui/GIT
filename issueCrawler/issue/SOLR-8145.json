Are people running SolrCloud in production in foreground mode? The OOM killer is really so that you don't have a zombie node that OOM'd in your cluster. That said, if you think the OOM killer is needed in fg mode for some reason, then open a new JIRA (this one is done) and post a patch please. ",

I think that running the OOM killer even in foreground mode makes sense.\n\nA separate question (probably requiring a new issue):  Regardless of foreground/background, should there be an environment variable that can be set to disable the OOM killer?  Like foreground mode, this would be for troubleshooting. ",
