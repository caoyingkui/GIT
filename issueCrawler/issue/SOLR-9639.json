    "description": "it fails.\n\nThe problem is over there when it deletes that temporal collection (which is a tricky thing per se) while it's still in recovery Solr Cloud went crazy: it closes the core, and almost done it, but it can't be unloaded because PeerSync (remember, it's recovering) open it ones, and it bloat logs with \n105902 INFO  (qtp3284815-656) [n:127.0.0.1:41440_ia%2Fd    ] o.a.s.c.SolrCore Core collection1 is not yet closed, waiting 100 ms before checking again.\nBut then, something spawn too many request /get?? which deadlocks until heap is exceeded and it dies. The fix is obvious, just to wait until recoveries finishes, before removing tmp_collection. \nBeside of this particular fix,is there any ideas about deadlock caused by deleting recovering collection?",
