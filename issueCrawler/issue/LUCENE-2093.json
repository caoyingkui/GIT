    "description": "Spinoff of LUCENE-2075.\n\nWe currently use a shared terms cache so multiple resolves of the same term within execution of a single query save CPU.  But this ties up a good amount of long term RAM...\n\nSo, it might be better to instead create a \"query private scope\", where places in Lucene like the terms dict could store & retrieve results.  The scope would be private to each running query, and would be GCable as soon as the query completes.  Then we've have perfect within query hit rate...",
