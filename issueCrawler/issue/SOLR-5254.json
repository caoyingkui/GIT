It was a holiday weekend after all ...\n\nIMO in addition to a good explanation of where update processors fit in the architecture, it would be good to have a limited use-case (or perhaps example transformation) for each of the update processors. Some kind of explanation of just how simple a document is at that point (i.e. it's just a set of key/value pairs), and some bits explaining how to deal with multiValued fields at this level. "

(but aparently i never typed up here) was an introductory page on the basics of the processor chains, with how to configure, and how to  select at runtime.  Then a few really in depth pages on some of the big concepts in chains: like how the distributed logic works, and the general class of field mutatating processors, then an \"other processors\" page (similar to the \"other query parsers\") page with a quick summary of all the processors not yet covered in depth, linking to the javadocs and to other sections in the ref guide that leverage these processors (ie: UUID -> unique key,  sig -> dedupication,  the managed schema processors/pages, etc...
