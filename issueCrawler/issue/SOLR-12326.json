    "description": "TestJsonFacets.testStatsDistrib() appears to result in more refinement requests than would otherwise be expected.  Those tests were developed before refinement was implemented and hence do not need refinement to generate correct results due to limited numbers of buckets.  This should be detectable by refinement code in the majority of cases to prevent extra work from being done.",

            "content": "One part of the solution is for the request merger to know if a shard has more buckets.  If it knows the exact amount of over-request used, then it can figure it out.  This is a little more fragile though, and I could envision future optimizations that dynamically change the amount of over-request based on things like heuristics, field statistics on that shard, and results of previous requests.   For that reason, I'm planning on just passing back more:true for field facets that have more values. ",
