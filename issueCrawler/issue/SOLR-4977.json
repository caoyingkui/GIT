So what I did in lucene was to exclude component=\"TP\" (means test point). I think it would be good to do here too.\n\tDo you think we should deprecate the /infostream/file method? Like we can issue a warning if someone does this, because really they could configure this guy to go to its own file (without rolling or whatever) via their logging configuration instead?\n\n "

One last question:\n\nShould we change isEnabled to look like this?\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean isEnabled(String component) {\n    // ignore testpoints so this can be used with tests without flooding logs with verbose messages\n    return !\"TP\".equals(component) && log.isInfoEnabled();\n  }\n\n\n\nThis way IndexWriter doesnt calculate anything if its not configured to log. We could even consider \"enabling\" this in solrconfig.xml by default, and instead deferring the control via the logging system. So we'd turn off logging for LoggingInfoStream in logging.properties by default, but someone could then turn it on there, or on-the-fly via the admin gui? "
