    "description": "If you use the core admin handler to create core and reference system properties and index files without restarting Solr, your files are indexed to the wrong place.\n\nSay for instance I define a sys prop EOE=/Users/Erick/tmp and create a core with this request\nlocalhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=coreZ&instanceDir=coreZ&dataDir=%24%7BEOE%7D\n\nwhere %24%7BEOE%7D is really ${EOE} after URL escaping. What gets preserved in solr.xml is correct, dataDir is set to ${EOE}. And if I restart Solr, then index documents, they wind up in /Users/Erick/tmp. This is as it should be.\n\nHOWEVER, if rather than immediately restart Solr I index some documents to CoreZ, they go in <solr_home>/CoreZ/${EOE}. The literal path is ${EOE}, dollar sign, curly braces and all.\n\nHow important is this to fix for 4.4?",

            "content": "Along the way, I wondered \"gee, what happens if we create a core in discovery mode?\" Well, we don't preserve properties passed on the URL. This patch preserves any parameters passed in on the admin URL, e.g. dataDir, config etc.\n\nOddly, you have to specify instanceDir even though it isn't a valid property for core.properties, else how do we let the user specify something not immediately below <solrhome>?\n\nBut my remaining problem is that I can't exit the test gracefully, searchers are left hanging and we get the partial stack trace below.\n\nThis usually means we did a CoreContainer.get and no corresponding close, but there aren't any such things. I think I even closed loading properties this time, although that would be unrelated I think.\n\nWhen we create cores in old-style solr.xml land, there's no need to do anything special to exit the tests. So I'm hoping someone has an \"aha\" moment. Otherwise I need to dig into core creation in the discovery case and find out if it really is different.\n\n\n\njava.lang.AssertionError: ERROR: SolrIndexSearcher opens=3 closes=1\n\tat __randomizedtesting.SeedInfo.seed([445018872D608FD5]:0)\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:93)\n\tat org.apache.solr.SolrTestCaseJ4.endTrackingSearchers(SolrTestCaseJ4.java:275)\n\tat org.apache.solr.SolrTestCaseJ4.afterClass(SolrTestCaseJ4.java:122)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n\tat com.carrotsearch.randomizedtesting.RandomizedRunner.invoke(RandomizedRunner.java:1559)\n\tat com.carrotsearch.randomizedtesting.RandomizedRunner.access$600(RandomizedRunner.java:79) "

Thanks to Shalin I managed to find a way to have the test terminate.\n\nAlong the way I've added a new method to SolrTestCaseJ4 that creates a \"no core\" test harness that assumes discovery mode on the theory that it took me a while to figure out how to do that and we were going to do this a lot more in the future. Any easier ways to do this?\n\nRunning tests and doing some manual inspection. If that all works out I'll probably check this in today. "
