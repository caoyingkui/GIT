Nothing done for other IDEs\n\n\n\nOne place still uses a deprecated method, that is in ExtractingDocumentLoader where we say parser = config.getParser(mediaType) - did not find the new equivalent. "

(This property is used in both the tika-core and the tika-parsers dependency version declarations in the <dependencyManagement> section in the same file.)  The commons-compress dependency is handled through Maven's transitive dependency mechanism, since it's declared as a dependency in the tika-parsers POM, and so no configuration changes are required for it.
