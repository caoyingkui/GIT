    "description": "When trying to index some Freebase articles, such as:\n\nhttp://maven.tamingtext.com/freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.tsv\n\nusing the SimplePostTool (bin/post), I ran into a few minor things along the way that would help new users trying to get their content indexed.\n\nFirst, I tried the naive approach:\n\n$ bin/post -c freebase ./freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.tsv \n\n\n\nDidn't work ... here's the output:\n\n\nSimplePostTool: WARNING: Skipping freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.tsv. Unsupported file type for auto mode.\n1 files indexed.\n\n\n\nUmmm ... no, 1 files not indexed  Instead the output should be something like:\n\n\nSimplePostTool: WARNING: Skipping freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.tsv. Unsupported file type for auto mode.\n0 of 1 files indexed.\n\n\n\nBesides the misleading output, shouldn't tsv be a supported file type for auto-mode? It's a common enough format ...\n\nSo I renamed the file to .csv instead and re-ran ... this time I get:\n\n\n$ mv freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.tsv freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.csv\n$ bin/post -c freebase ./freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.csv\n\nERROR - 2015-01-28 16:24:16.074; org.apache.solr.common.SolrException; org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: CSVLoader: input=null, line=1,expected 108 values but got 4\n\n\n\nHmmm ... OK ... did a little Googling and discovered I needed to specify the separator to be %09 (again, the tool should just recognize TSV as a supported format)\n\n\nbin/post -c freebase -params \"separator=%09&escape=\\\\\" ./freebase-wex-2011-01-18-articles-first10k.csv\n\n\n\nSuccess! (of course I had to add a header line to the file too, but there's little we can do about that)",
