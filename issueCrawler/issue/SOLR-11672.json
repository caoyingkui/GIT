    "description": "I have a SOLR installation with two shards and this Facet Query configuration:\n\n    <lst name=\"invariants\">\n      <str name=\"facet.query\">\n{!key=\"$0 - $50\"}\nprice_d:[* TO 50]</str>\n     ....\n    </lst>\n\nWhen I run a query and the first shard returns a facet count less than the minimum count then it will remove that Facet Query from the list FacetInfo.queryFacets map in the method: removeQueryFacetsUnderLimits(). When the Facet Component is handled for the second shard the get() on FacetInfo.queryFacets will return null (entry was removed) and the subsequent call to qf.count() is throwing an NPE.\n\nThis code will fix the NPE but in my opinion the removal of the Query Facets should be moved to finishStage() method in order to make sure that countFacets() works w/o an NPE.\n\nThis issue was previously reported under 2803 as far as I understand it.\n\nI am working on the 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT code base but looking at the latest code this still seems to be an issue.",
