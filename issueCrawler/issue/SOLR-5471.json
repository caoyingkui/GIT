    "description": "I am using solr cloud 4.3.1 with zookeeper for coordination\n\nWe shard our data (mostly 2-3 shards) with a replication factor of 2. After  I make changes to schema/configs and upload to zookeeper, I reload the collection that was updated (to use the latest schema)\n\nThis call reloads all the shards but for some reason, a few of the shards are \"marked as down\" by zookeeper. However the shards are healthy and are queryable\n\nIt seems many of them are experiencing this issues with solr cloud (Googling around forums/stack overflow tells me this)\n\nIs this a known issue? If not what would be a recommended fix?\n\nThanks a ton",
