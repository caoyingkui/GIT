This'll be a great tool for giving people a better understanding of what all that stuff on the wiki is about!\n\nMinor comments:\n1> When doing a \"file upload\" and adding a literal.id=doc1 it took me a couple of minutes to figure out that I had to prepend with &. Perhaps a check before appending the params to the URL? Or just an example on the label for the entry field with the '&'?\n\n2> maybe a similar thing for entering the Request-handler for uploading structured docs, pdfs and the like, or maybe some kind of button or checkbox or radio button for \"upload structured doc\". Or maybe the document type drop down with another choice \"upload/extract doc (e.g. pdf, jpg)\" that auto-filled the request handler? I kind of like this last, using \"extract\" directs them to the extracting request handler. And auto-fill the request handler with just \"/update\" when they clicked something else.\n\n\n3> If I actually specify a version on the \"document builder\" section I get an error. Should we not allow them to specify a version? I can also argue that having the version actually really good so people get a clue not to mess with it <G>... Possibly display version (expert) in the drop down?\n\nBut these are all minor issues compared to how cool this is!\n "
