    "description": "I'll attach my client program in a second but the gist is that closing a CloudSolrStream hangs the client for about 50 seconds no matter how it's closed.\n\nSetup:\n\n\tCreate a 2-shard, leader-only collection\n\tIndex a million documents to it\n\trun the attached program.\n\n\n\nAt the end you'll see the message printed out \"We finally stopped\", but the program hands for roughly 50 seconds before exiting.\n\nThe hang happens with all these situations:\n\n\tread to EOF tuple\n\tstop part way through\n\tclose in a finally block\n\tclose with try-with-resources\n\n\n\nIn the early-termination case, I do see the following (expected) error in solr's log:\n\nERROR - 2017-11-30 16:18:20.024; [c:eoe s:shard2 r:core_node4 x:eoe_shard2_replica_n2] org.apache.solr.common.SolrException; null:Early Client Disconnect\n\nI see the same behavior in 7.0\n\nThe claim is this worked in earlier 7x versions, 7.0 in particular. I'll test that shortly and report results.",
