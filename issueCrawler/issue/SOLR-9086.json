    "description": "Proposed additions:\n\n\tTake numDocs count of all replicas during backup and validate them during restore\n\tUser can pass \"rule\" and \"snitch\" param for the restored collection as well . CollectionsHandler#RESTORE_OP needs to keeps those two params.\n\tMark the API as experimental . We might want to wait for SOLR-9055 to pan out . Also in-case we want to change the \"name\" param to \"snapshot\" or \"snapshotName\" as proposed here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-5750?focusedCommentId=15260749&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15260749\n\n\n\nMisc Changes:\n\n\tImprove log message throw new SolrException(ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR, \"Couldn't restore since doesn't exist: \" + backupPath); . It should be \"doesn't\" -> \"location doesn't\"\n\tMove OverseerCollectionMessageHandler#processBackupAction and OverseerCollectionMessageHandler#processRestoreAction to their own classes\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tDuring restore should be do a checksum verification of the configSet and fail fast if a configSet with the same name exists but the checksum doesn't match?",
