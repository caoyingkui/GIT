    "description": "There is a limit on the length of indexed string values of 256 characters, this results in undesirable behavior for facet field values for example: \n\n<lst name=\"facet_fields\">\n<lst name=\"pub_articletitle\">\n<int name=\"1\">2302</int>\n<int name=\"hiv\">1403</int>\n<int name=\"type\">1382</int>\n</lst>\n<lst name=\"tissue-antology\">\n<int name=\"Lymph node,Organ component,Cardinal organ part,Anatomical structure,Material anatomical entity,Physical anatomical entity,Anatomical entity\">419</int>\n<int name=\"Left frontal lobe,Frontal lobe,Lobe of cerebral hemisphere,Segment of cerebral hemisphere,Segment of telencephalon,Segment of forebrain,Segment of brain,Segment of neuraxis,Organ segment,Organ region,Cardinal organ part,Anatomical structure,*Material anatom\">236</int>\n<int name=\"ical entity,Physical anatomical entity,Anatomical entity\">236</int>*\n</lst>  \n\nThe last facet in the list is being truncated and spills into a new facet. This also eats up a facet since i usually only return the top 3. \n\nIs 256 characters a hard limit in the indexing strategy?",
