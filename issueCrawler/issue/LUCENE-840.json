Seems kind\n: of weird to have tests for tests, but this is becoming sufficiently\n: complex that it should have some tests.",

Once 837 is committed I will update this patch.\n\nI had to modify a little the Benchmark class API so that it is easy to run a benchmark from a String, using StringReader (rather than from a file).\n\nAdded two tests only - a \"parse\" one that verifies that tasks are parsed to what they should, and a \"logic\" one that verifies that the test side effects (index creation, docs adding, search being called, etc.) is as expected. I think it should be fairly easy now to add further tests to the \"logic\" one, should that be needed.\n\nTo use it:\n\n\tcd to contrib/benchmark\n\tapply patch\n\tant test\n\n ",
