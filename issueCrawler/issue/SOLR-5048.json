I think it should say 4.5, since LUCENE_45 is the only un-deprecated version for branch_4x now, right?\n\nMaybe the step \"After creating a new release branch, update the version in the base release branch (e.g. branches/branch_4x)\" needed to be reviewed (or merely followed) a little more closely.\n\nSee:\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ReleaseTodo#Branching_.26_Feature_Freeze "
