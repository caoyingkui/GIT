            "content": "I've been talking with this user on IRC.  Here's a summary:\n\nIt seems that facet parameters in localparams only apply at the shard level, rather than the whole collection.  So if \"f.workflow.assignedTo.facet.mincount\" is in the localparam, and there are enough docs with the field value in one shard, then it shows up in the output, and depending on how the mincount matches up with the count in each shard, the number of docs in the response might not be correct for the whole collection.  If \"f.workflow.assignedTo.facet.mincount\" is a URL parameter instead of part of locaparams, then it works completely as expected.\n\nThe burning question: Is this a bug, or an expected change due to new capability or some other bugfix?  It's definitely a regression for the user \u2013 everything works for them in version 4.9, but doesn't in 6.6, 5.5.3, and 4.10.4. ",
