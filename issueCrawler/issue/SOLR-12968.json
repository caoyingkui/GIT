    "description": "I randomly discovered this file: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/7.5.0/solr/core/src/test-files/mailing_lists.pdf\n\nThis task here is to consider options and (possibly) make changes, e.g.\n\n\tto keep the file as is\n\tto remove the file\n\tto refresh the file content (keep it as .pdf format) e.g. to mention the http://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html page and/or the Solr Reference Guide\n\tto replace the file (moving away from .pdf format) and to refresh its content\n\n\n\nIt appears three tests are using the file i.e. a simple remove or replace might not be a practical option?",
