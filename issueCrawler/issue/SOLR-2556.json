            "content": "when i read this issue, i assumed it was simply a matter of the spellcheck response block not being included if there was no suggestions, but it's more subtle then that.\n\nThese queries don't produce any spellcheck section in the response at all...\n\n\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/spell?debugQuery=true&q=1&spellcheck=true&spellcheck.collate=true&spellcheck.build=true\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/spell?debugQuery=true&q=9999&spellcheck=true&spellcheck.collate=true&spellcheck.build=true\n\n\n\nBut these queries do (even if that section contains no suggestions)....\n\n\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/spell?debugQuery=true&q=______&spellcheck=true&spellcheck.collate=true&spellcheck.build=true\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/spell?debugQuery=true&q=asfasdfasdfasdfasdf&spellcheck=true&spellcheck.collate=true&spellcheck.build=true\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/spell?debugQuery=true&spellcheck.q=9999&q=9999&spellcheck=true&spellcheck.collate=true&spellcheck.build=true\n\n\n\nNote in particular that last one - using \"spellcheck.q=9999\" causes the empty section to appear, even if it's identical to \"q=9999\"\n\nSkimming the code, the problem seems to relate to the user of the \"queryConverter\", and the fact that it's only used on the \"q\" param (a different code path is used on the \"spellcheck.q\" param) and what happens if no tokens are produced \u2013 the \"spellcheck\" block is added to the response inside a conditional block that is only executed if there are tokens.\n\nIt seems like it would be fairly easy to just move the code that adds the block to the response outside of the conditional \u2013 but the fact that the two code paths produce different behavior makes me wonder if this isn't semi-intentional?  is the idea that \"your query converter produced no tokens, therefore we assume you don't want any spellcheck results?\"  should it be?\n\n(FWIW: there is a similar condition where no \"spellcheck\" response is generated if there are no dictionaries configured) "

            "content": "I've been investigating this oddity in an app I'm working on and found this issue here.  I agree with Hoss's assessment \u2013 I have the same conclusions.  If the current behavior is \"semi-intentional\", it isn't clear it should be; we could ask about the wisdom to James Dyer?.  IMO, FWIW, this is a bug.  Other components, when enabled (e.g. facet=on), output something; it's disconcerting to see nothing from spellcheck from time to time, and makes client parsing code more error prone (didn't expect a null).  I may have time to fix this soon-ish. "

If there are no terms in the query that can be corrected, it leaves it off altogether. "
