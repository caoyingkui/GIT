I am hacking C longer than Java. This was not about C it was about the MSDN docs telling something different. See my last comment above. Thats all. Why are you so aggresive?\n\n\nException handling: in native read, you call throwIOException, when ReadFile() returns false.

Also the copy operation is not really needed.\n\nI don't think you know what you are talking about!\n\nSorry we seem to have a misunderstanding. I was not talking about the internal copy the JVM does. I was talking about the fact, that you should not call JNI functions anymore when you set the thread's exception status and exit the function as soon as possible. You set this status after the failed ReadFile with throwIOEx(). After that its no longer needed to copy the buffer[] to the java byte array and its risky to do it because I am not sure if this env->SetByteArrayRegion() is safe to be called after exception status is set - that all I wanted to say. I would change tha code to:\n\n\nif (ReadFile((HANDLE) fd, &buffer, length, &numRead, &io)) {\n  env->SetByteArrayRegion(bytes, offset, numRead, (const jbyte *) buffer);\n} else {\n  throwIOException(env, GetLastError());\n  numRead = -1;\n}  \t\n\n\n\nPlease note env->throwNew() always returns, it simply sets the thread's exception status, so the JVM thorws the Java Exce\u00fcption passed in after the native method returns to Java bytecode again.\n\nThanks,\nNative Policeman ",
