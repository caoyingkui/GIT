    "description": "When ShingleFilter hits a hole, it uses _ as the token, e.g. bigrams for \"the dog barked\", if you have a StopFilter removing the, would be: \"_ dog\", \"dog barked\".\n\nBut if the input ends with a stopword, e.g. \"wizard of\", ShingleFilter fails to produce \"wizard _\" due to LUCENE-3849 ... once we fix that I think we should fix ShingleFilter to make shingles for trailing holes too ...",
