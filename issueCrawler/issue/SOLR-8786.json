            "content": "Joel Bernstein - Apache Zeppelin already seems to work with the Solr JDBC driver. I attached the notebook json and a pdf of the printout from the run notebook. The charts and graphs work well too. \n\nThe one thing that isn't intuitive is that you can't have a semicolon at the end of the statement. This causes the following exception:\n\n\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: --> http://default.attlocal.net:8983/solr/test_shard1_replica1/:line 1:33: extraneous input ';' expecting <EOF>\n\n\n\nThe other weird thing I found was that \"select * from test limit 10\" doesn't seem to work. This causes the following exception:\n\n\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: --> http://default.attlocal.net:8983/solr/test_shard1_replica1/:Select columns must be specified.\n\n\n\nThe error message for each of those is \"Couldn't read first tuple\" so that needs to be improved. It would be great to improve that error message before 6.0 goes out. ",
