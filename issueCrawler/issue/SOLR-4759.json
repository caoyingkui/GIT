    "description": "Cleanup to Velocity templates shipped under solr/example/solr/collection1/conf/velocity\n\n\n\tAdd README.txt file with complete file list\n\tAdd comments to all files\n\tAdd indenting where feasible, fixed indenting in other places.  I don't believe I've broken anything that required precise indenting.\n\tMake file naming consistent.  We had this_that, thisThat and this-that\n  Changed all to this_that, though also considered this-that.\n\tModularize some files\n\tIncluded a hit_plain.vm example, though not active by default.\n\tRewrote city/lon/lat selector to work from a hash, though doesn't change the behavior.\n\tCSS changes, primarily to make top \"tabs\" actually look like Tabs (primitive CSS, but at least conveys the idea)\n\n\n\nAs far as I know this doesn't change any behavior of the system, nor does it fix any existing bugs.  Although I might do bug fixing in a later patch, I wanted to keep this as a pure \"code readability\" patch.",
