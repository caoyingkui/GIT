    "description": "Working with Polygon is a bit tricky today because you typically\nmust use an external dependency to convert e.g. a GeoJSON string into\nLucene's Polygon class ... I think this is a weakness in our API, and\nit clearly confuses users: http://markmail.org/thread/mpge4wqo7cfqm4i5\n\nSo I created a simplistic GeoJSON parser to extract a single Polygon\nor MultiPolygon from a GeoJSON string, without any dependencies.  The\nparser only handles the various ways that a single Polygon or\nMultiPolygon can appear in a GeoJSON string, and throws an exception\notherwise.",
