    "description": "When searching for indexed non-point shapes (such as polygons), there are redundant cells which can be skipped at the bottom \"detail level\" of the search.  This won't be a problem once LUCENE-4942 is fixed since there then won't be any but it's easy to fix now.\n\nThis affects all predicates RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy uses except Contains.",

            "content": "In my testing this resulted in 1-3% increase on circles; it'll likely be greater for polygon query shapes where it's more expensive to do an intersection test.\n\nThe patch includes unrelated TODOs on spatial classes for things I want to get to in the near future. It also includes a small change to query equality (equals & hashcode) such that a tuning parameter isn't included because it doesn't change the semantics of the query.\n\nI'll commit this Monday. ",
