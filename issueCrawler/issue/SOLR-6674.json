    "description": "We have a SolrCloud with Solr version 4.7 with Tomcat 7. And our solr index(cores) are big(50~100G) each core. \n\nWhen we start up tomcat, the solr webapp deployment is very slow. From tomcat's catalina log, every time it takes about 10 minutes to get deployed. After we analyzing java core dump, we notice it's because the loading process cannot finish until the MBean calculation for large index is done.\n\nSo we tried to remove the <jmx/> from solrconfig.xml, after that, the loading of solr webapp only take about 1 minute. So we can sure the MBean calculation for large index is the root cause.\n\nCould you please point me if there is any async way to do statistic monitoring without <jmx/> in solrconfig.xml, or let it do calculation after the deployment? Thanks!",
