There was a bug where lastIdx was not set and was recreating the comparator and re-initializing the leafComparator for each document.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/johnthcall/lucene-solr patch-1\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/115.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #115\n\n\ncommit 8a47601e0f42563c1d45c3049d21194505b1a89d\nAuthor: John Call <johncall@microsoft.com>\nDate:   2016-11-15T20:37:37Z\n\n    SOLR-9772 FieldSortValues should reuse comparator and only invalidate leafComparator\n\n ",
