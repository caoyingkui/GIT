Its not super-optimized, but the 3 common conditions (no delimiters, all delimiters, just one word surrounded by delimiters) are just as fast. for the concatenation+parts stuff I used captureState (we can avoid it, it was just about correctness for me).\n\nI think this is fairly important to fix so users can use e.g. postings highlighter and don't hit bugs like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20324016/shingle-filter-factory-startoffset-must-be-non-negative-and-endoffset-must-be  ",
