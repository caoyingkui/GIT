I think, now that Solr/Lucene are merged, and we're looking at opening an unstable line of development for Solr/Lucene, now is the right time to do it.\n\nA standalone module for all analyzers also empowers apps to separately version the analyzers from which version of Solr/Lucene they use, possibly enabling us to remove Version entirely from the analyzers.\n\nWe should also do LUCENE-2309 (decouple, as much as possible, indexer from the analysis API), but I don't think that issue needs to block this consolidation.\n\nOnce we do this, there is one place where our users can find all the analyzers that Solr/Lucene provide.",

If we build a DFA out of the stopwords, like done in the MockFilter, and also minimize it, will the checking for a hit not be much faster? e.g. if the first character of the termBuffer does not match the automaton it gets rejected. CAS always has to calculate the hashCode of the whole string first and then look it up.\nI would like to see a comparison with a minimized Automaton vs. CAS for StopFilter. OK, LengthFilter is more performant by just comparing TermLength, but the StopFilter should be much faster.\nI propose to pass a Set to the StopFilter and internally it converts it to a minimized Automaton similar to MockFilter.

            "content": "May this much faster than CharArraySet\n\nI ran indexing tests a while ago (reuters) with CharArraySet itself implemented with a DFA, and it was slightly faster, but not much. I think this is because english words are usually not very long (average length=5). For other languages this technique might save some cpu time, but there are some \"problems\" i imagine\n\n\n\tbuilding an automaton from a list of words is more expensive, although Dawid Weiss has implemented an addition to automaton that does this fast.\n\tin general building automaton and runautomaton etc is more \"heavy\" i would think, but Mike Mccandless hacked away a lot of this heaviness when we converted to UTF-32.\n\tthe CharacterRunAutomaton is not optimized right now, we disabled the classmap[] for chars because it consume more RAM. I think if we were to care about performance on char[] we should make it classmap 0x0-0xffff and binary search the rest, or something similar. currently it binarysearches on each input character.\n\n\n\nSomewhat related, a while ago i tested this with CharArraySet as a DFA, and opened this issue: LUCENE-2227. But obviously this is not the only way, as this example shows filtering on the dfa itself (and not using chararrayset at all). \n\nSo in general, i have those concerns right now, but maybe in the future once some things are addressed we could at least make an optional stopfilter impl or something similar.\n\nOne thing i like about this filter personally, is that rejected terms always get (optionally) the posInc increased... I do not think our existing KeepWord or LengthFilters do this, but maybe i am wrong. ",
