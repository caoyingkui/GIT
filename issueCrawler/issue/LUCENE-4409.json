    "description": "today we have a lot of custom python scripts checking javadocs (checking for missing stuff too).\n\nMost of this is implemented by parsing html etc (some of this should stay this way, like broken-link detection)\n\nBut actually the eclipse compiler can do most of this type of linting, and has a lot of options for it. We can pull it via ivy and run it from the command-line.\n\nI tested this manually by adding a bogus throws clause to Codec.java, downloading the ecj.jar from maven and running it manually:\n\n\nrmuir@beast:~/workspace/lucene-trunk/lucene/core/src/java$ java -cp ~/Downloads/ecj-3.7.2.jar org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.batch.Main -source 1.6 -d none -enableJavadoc -properties ~/workspace/lucene-trunk/dev-tools/eclipse/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs .\n...\n----------\n120. ERROR in /home/rmuir/workspace/lucene-trunk/lucene/core/src/java/./org/apache/lucene/codecs/Codec.java (at line 59)\n\t* @throws IOException */\n\t          ^^^^^^^^^^^\nJavadoc: Exception IOException is not declared\n----------\n\n\n\nhere i specified -d none (don't generate class files), and essentially told it to read the compiler warnings/errors options set in the dev-tools config. For javadocs-lint we would want our own separate properties file that disables the ordinary java warnings (because eclipse can warn/error/ignore on lots of things, not just javadocs, and does by default).\n\nSeparately we could also use this to check/fail/warn on other things besides javadoc...",

I'll make the macro use a throwaway directory and delete it.\n\ta bug in solrj javadocs: it links to the lucene queryparser syntax incorrectly. I don't know why this is working with 'ant javadocs', but it really shouldnt, since lucene queryparser should not be in its compile classpath. I'll fix it to use docRoot.\n\n ",
