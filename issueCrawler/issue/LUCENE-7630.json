            "content": "Hi, could you create a Pull Request and add the link here?\n\nAbout your branch: I would not use cloneAttributes() because thats slow for this simple case. cloneAttributes() only helps if you want to modify the attributes in the AttributeSource that was created, but is not useful for simple save/restore use cases.\n\nFor your case, you should simple use captureState(), save the state object and then call restorestate() instead of clearAttributes(). After restoring you can adapt term text and positions/offsets. In addition when you clone or capture state, the call to clearAttributes() is useless and also slows down. When restoring states, everything is restored, so the additional clearing before is not needed. ",
