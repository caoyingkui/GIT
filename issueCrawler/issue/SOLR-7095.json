    "description": "Feature request to add native online cross-site DR support for NRT SolrCloud.\n\nCurrently NRT DR recovery requires taking down the recovering cluster including halting any new indexing, changing zookeeper emsembles to the other datacenter for one node per shard to replicate, then taking down again to switch back to local DC zookeeper ensemble after shard has caught up. This is a relatively difficult/tedious manual operation to perform and seems impossible to get completely up to date in scenarios with constant new update requests arriving during downtime of switching back to local DC's zookeeper ensemble, therefore preventing 100% accurate catch up.\n\nThere will be trade-offs such as making cross-site replication async to avoid update latency penalty, and may require a last-write-wins type scenario like Cassandra.\n\nRegards,\n\nHari Sekhon\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/harisekhon",
