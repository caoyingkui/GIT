            "content": "by the way, in LuceneTestCase[J4] which now all Solr base test classes extend, there is:\n\n\n   /** Create indexes in this directory, optimally use a subdir, named after the test */\n  public static final File TEMP_DIR;\n\n\n\nso you can just access this to get your temp dir. I think we just need to make sure solr's build.xml's set the right sysprops,\nbut this would make it consistent with lucene easily? "

(it only fixes solr core, but I think we can fix contrib build.xml's the same way).\n\nOne benefit is that since temp stuff goes in build/ like lucene: on windows, 'ant clean' \nwill remove spellchecker indexes or other leftover stuff that couldnt be deleted in tearDown(), \nrather than littering your system temp directory.
