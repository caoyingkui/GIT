    "description": "I think that precommit should depend on clean.  On branch_5x, I started a precommit, then realized partway through that I was running with Java 8.  I interrupted the precommit, changed JAVA_HOME to point at Java 7, and started it again.  After a few minutes, the forbidden-api check failed because it couldn't find a class.\n\nIs there any situation where a clean should NOT be done before starting precommit?",
