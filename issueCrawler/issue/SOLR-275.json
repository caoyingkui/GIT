    "description": "A PHP response writer that returns a serialized array that can be used with the PHP function unserialize ( http://php.net/unserialize )\n\nBuilt off the JSON Writer\n\nI was not sure if this should be merged with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-196\n\nI have tried to keep code duplication very minimal, but always room for improvement!\n\nPlace PHPResponseWriter.java in src/org/apache/solr/request\nAdd the below to your solrconfig.xml:\n<queryResponseWriter name=\"php\" class=\"org.apache.solr.request.PHPResponseWriter\"/>\n\nDescription of PHP serialization format: http://www.hurring.com/scott/code/perl/serialize/",

            "content": "Hi Nick,\n\nThanks for submitting your PHPResponseWriter code, it seems to work pretty well, however I needed to made a couple of minor changes to get it to compile with the current svn trunk:\n\n27,28c27,28\n< import org.apache.solr.util.NamedList;\n< import org.apache.solr.util.SimpleOrderedMap;\n\u2014\n> import org.apache.solr.common.util.NamedList;\n> import org.apache.solr.common.util.SimpleOrderedMap;\n\nThe updated code I submitted also fixes a bug that caused the serialized data to be corrupt when \"score\" was not included in the return fields list:\n\n162c162\n<     writer.write(\"a:4:{\");\n\u2014\n>     writer.write(\"a:\"(includeScore ? 4 : 3)\":{\");\n\nsince if score was not included, the \"response\" array contained only three values rather than four.\n\nHopefully we can get a few more people testing this code thoroughly to make sure it works in all cases, since the PHP unserialize() function is very unforgiving on badly formatted data!\n\ncheers,\nTristan "
