    "description": "I discovered in looking at differences between the .war's produced by the Maven and Ant builds (over on SOLR-3706) that the Ant-built .war contains cglib-nodep-*.jar and objenesis-*.jar under WEB-INF/lib/.\n\nmvn dependency:tree says that easymock-*.jar depends on these two jars.  In the Maven build, the solr core module depends on easymock-*.jar with test scope; as a result, none of these three jars are included in the Maven-built .war, since test scope deps are automatically excluded from the .war.\n\neasymock-*.jar is not included in the Ant-built .war because solr/webapp/build.xml explicitly excludes it.  These other two jars should get the same treatment.\n\nHere's a patch to remove these two jars from the .war:\n\n\nIndex: solr/webapp/build.xml\n===================================================================\n--- solr/webapp/build.xml\t(revision 1461743)\n+++ solr/webapp/build.xml\t(working copy)\n@@ -50,6 +50,8 @@\n       <lib dir=\"${common-solr.dir}/core/lib\" excludes=\"${exclude.from.war},${common.classpath.excludes}\">\n         <exclude name=\"*servlet-api*.jar\" />\n         <exclude name=\"easymock-*.jar\" />\n+        <exclude name=\"cglib-nodep-*.jar\" />\n+        <exclude name=\"objenesis-*.jar\" />\n       </lib>\n       <lib dir=\"${common-solr.dir}/solrj/lib\" excludes=\"${exclude.from.war},${common.classpath.excludes}\"/>\n       <lib dir=\"${lucene-libs}\" excludes=\"${exclude.from.war},${common.classpath.excludes}\" />",
