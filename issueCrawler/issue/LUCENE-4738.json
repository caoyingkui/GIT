    "description": "1. Start a NEW IndexWriterBuilder on an empty folder,\n   add some documents to the index\n2. Call commit\n3. When the segments_1 file with 0 byte was created, kill the JVM\n\nWe will end with a corrupted index with an empty segments_1.\n\nWe only have issue with the first commit crash.\n\nAlso, if you tried to open an IndexSearcher on a new index. And the first commit on the index was not finished yet. Then you will see exception like:\n===========================================================================\norg.apache.lucene.index.IndexNotFoundException: no segments* file found in org.apache.lucene.store.MMapDirectory@C:\\tmp\\testdir lockFactory=org.apache.lucene.store.NativeFSLockFactory@6ee00df: files: [write.lock, _0.fdt, _0.fdx]\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run(SegmentInfos.java:741)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.StandardDirectoryReader.open(StandardDirectoryReader.java:52)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.open(DirectoryReader.java:65)\n===========================================================================\n\n\nSo when a new index was created, we should first create an empty index. We should not wait for the commit/close call to create the segment file.\nIf we had an empty index there. It won't leave a corrupted index when there were a power issue on the first commit. \nAnd a concurrent IndexSearcher can access to the index(No match is better than exception).",
