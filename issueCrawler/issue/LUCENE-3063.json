    "description": "Currently these analysis components are in the lucene core, but should really\nbe .util in the analyzers module.\n\nAlso, with MockTokenizer extending Tokenizer directly, we can add some additional\nchecks in the future to try to ensure our consumers are being good consumers (e.g. calling reset).\n\nThis is mentioned in http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/TestIdeas, I didn't implement it here yet,\nthis is just the factoring. I think we should try to do this before LUCENE-3040.",

For example, the lucene analyzers common jar is here: https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-Maven-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/maven_artifacts/org/apache/lucene/lucene-analyzers-common/4.0-SNAPSHOT/.  Note that this is a separate build, so the time stamps, and the time stamp format, will be different. ",
