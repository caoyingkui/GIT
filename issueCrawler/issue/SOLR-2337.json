If there are 20 rows that match your query and are grouped, and if rows=10, then hits will be 10 (since the code does not loop through all results to short circuit and speed up the results). Otherwise there could be a performance issue with looping until end of results. FWIW, the number of matches could be thought of as hits, just not for this use case.\n2. As normal, if there are 4 rows that match and are grouped, and you say rows=10, hits will be 4 (normal behavior). "
