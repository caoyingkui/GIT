We've been through this before many times, the argument is always that someone is looking at the failures and knows which ones are bad.\n\nThis argument is a lie. Nobody is watching these failures, or DistributedQueryComponentOptimizationTest would not have failed repeatedly for two straight days when the fix was trivial (I fixed this last night: http://svn.apache.org/r1571930)\n\nIts frustrating to me as a committer, solr tests NEVER pass on my machine, no matter how many times I try. How can i possibly commit something without knowing i am making the situation even worse?\n\nThis is all a big problem for developers, release managers, even users of the project. The test suite should pass.\n\nThe old argument that \"solr tests are allowed to fail\" is no longer valid. I will disable all constantly failing tests.",

I know that is hard to get distributed tests to pass but it should be our main objective to get things stable. I think it's mandatory for getting new contributors in as well as for existing contributors to develop code. For me as a RM it was a nightmare really to realize that a release build skips all the solr tests because if we would run them it would mean the RC would never happen at least on my machine that was the case when I enabled them. It's super important to have a build that passes otherwise you never know if you broke something. If we have a test that sometimes fails then try to fix it or try to catch the condition under that it is failing and let it pass so that we can see if there is a difference in the failure. \n\n..but our 'steady state' needs to be BUILD SUCCESSFUL.\nI could not agree more "

If people want to contribute towards that great, and thanks to everyone that has so far, but I can't allow wholesale disabling of tests.\n\nThe ones Robert was looking at were not these infrequent fails though - they were more common fails due to both the performance of SSL and a bug in disabling it for tests.
