    "description": "Followup issue from discussion on SOLR-11645.\n\nThe Java commandline argument list is currently sorted alphanumerically in the admin UI dashboard.  If there is any possibility that Java might behave differently with competing options in a different order (which I think is likely, but I have not yet verified), it is a bad idea to show them in a different order than they actually exist on the commandline.  In that event, it would be impossible to determine what Java will actually do if the actual order cannot be seen.\n\nI propose that we make the list unsorted by default, which will show them in actual commandline order, and then place some kind of \"Sort Args\" button/option on the dashboard that will temporarily order them so it is easier to scan the list quickly.  A page refresh once the list is sorted should restore the unsorted list.\n\nAdditionally, if a separate section showing the actual command could be added (which would typically show the following), that would be very nice.\n\nSample of what a section for the actual Java command would contain:\n\n-jar start.jar \"--module=http\"",
