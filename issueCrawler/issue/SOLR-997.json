I still trying to figure out why execution of a Callable will be rejected. A commit has been called so the searchExecutor should be alive and the Executors.singleThreadedExecutor uses an unbounded LinkedBlockingQueue so queue.offer should not fail.\n\nI haven't been able to reproduce the issue with Java6 on WinXP. I'll download java5 and try again.\n\n "
