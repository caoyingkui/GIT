Both end up with the same score because on shard one the query is rewritten to \"foo:findm*^20\" (norm = .05) and \"bar:findm*\" (norm = 1). ",

We return BooleanQuery(true) empty in that case, hwich has a different querynorm than ConstantScoreQuery, resulting in different scores. To be consistent we should return the same query type (ConstantScoreQuery for the constant rewrites). This has no speed impact, as the scorer is always empty. ",
