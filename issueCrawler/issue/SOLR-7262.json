            "content": "OK, so it looks like SOLR-7073 consolidated different types of plugin loading into one mechanism/container.  Some of them were thread safe (request handlers) and most were not.\n\nI didn't change everything to thread safe because it could have performance implications... there can be dozens or more lookups to all these plugins per request.  For now, I've only enabled thread safety (for writes) for request handlers.\n\nPatch attached. ",
