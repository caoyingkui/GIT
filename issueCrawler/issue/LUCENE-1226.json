    "description": "Even if no exception is thrown while writing the compound file at the end of the \naddIndexes() call, the transaction is rolled back and the successfully written cfs \nfile deleted. The fix is simple: There is just the \n\nsuccess = true;\n\n\nstatement missing at the end of the try{} clause.\n\nAll tests pass. I'll commit this soon to trunk and 2.3.2.",
