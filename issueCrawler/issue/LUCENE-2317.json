I feel like we live inside a particle accelerator]\n\nRight now Lucene indexes the docTermFreq and positions into the postings, by default.\n\nYou can use omitTFAP to turn them both off, which if you also omit norms gives you \"match only\" scoring.\n\nBut, really, they ought to be separately controllable \u2013 one may want to include docTermFreq but not positions, to get full scoring for non-positional phrases.\n\nProbably we should wait until LUCENE-2308 is done, and make the API change on *FieldType.",

Maybe it should become its own FieldType constant ... it will be bundling together a bunch of options that can be set individually if one wants finer grained control. ",
