The problem is that we can not distinguish between hard-deletes and soft-deletes in SoftDeletesRetentionMergePolicy. This MP brings to live documents that soft-deleted then hard-deleted. We then count those documents as soft-deleted in merging. I attached a test for this. I am not sure if we should fix this or not.\n\n\u00a0 ",

The calculation now loops over only the soft-deleted docs, not all docs (please see LUCENE-8381-inline.patch).\n\nAnother option that I see is to pass the hardLiveDocs to the soft-deletes merge policy.
