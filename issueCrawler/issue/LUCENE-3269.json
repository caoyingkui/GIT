            "content": "Patch looks good. One other idea I think we should try is to create the large indexes once per all Top-K tests extensions. There are several references to FacetTestBase.initIndex(), and I think that the TopK tests can create their indexes (which is the same) at @BeforeClass, perhaps all indexes per partition sizes that are tested, and then proceed with testing. I think that will cut away a large portion of the running time. ",
