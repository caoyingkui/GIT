    "description": "We should remove support for 2.x (and 1.9) indexes in 4.0. It seems that nothing can be done in 3x because there is no special code which handles 1.9, so we'll leave it there. This issue should cover:\n\n\tRemove the .zip indexes\n\tRemove the unnecessary code from SegmentInfo and SegmentInfos. Mike suggests we compare the version headers at the top of SegmentInfos, in 2.9.x vs 3.0.x, to see which ones can go.\n\tremove FORMAT_PRE from FieldInfos\n\tRemove old format from TermVectorsReader\n\n\n\nIf you know of other places where code can be removed, then please post a comment here.\n\nI don't know when I'll have time to handle it, definitely not in the next few days. So if someone wants to take a stab at it, be my guest.",

While this isn't needed currently for trunk - the code is commented out, and I don't think it bothers anyone - one day, after 4.0 is released, we will need to use it. So I don't think we should remove that piece of code.\n\n\n\n\n\tTestIndexFileDeleter failed 'cause of deletable file - fixed it.\n\n\n\nAttached is the merged patch, w/ the above fixes. Solr tests fail (.dataimport. tests) for some reason. I don't understand this yet - so if someone more knowledgeable about Solr than me cares to take a look, I'd appreciate it. I see many things like that (not sure how those tests are related to this issue):\n\n\n    [junit]\n    [junit]  request was: q=id:500&start=0&qt=standard&version=2.2&rows=20\n    [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: now it should query failed XPath: //result[@numFound=1]\n    [junit]  xml response was: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    [junit] <response>\n    [junit] <lst name=\"responseHeader\"><int name=\"status\">0</int><int name=\"QTime\">16</int></lst><result name=\"response\" numFound=\"0\" start=\"0\"/>\n    [junit] </response>\n    [junit]\n    [junit]  request was: q=id:500&start=0&qt=standard&version=2.2&rows=20\n    [junit]     at org.apache.solr.util.AbstractSolrTestCase.assertQ(AbstractSolrTestCase.java:236)\n    [junit]     at org.apache.solr.update.AutoCommitTest.testMaxTime(AutoCommitTest.java:218)\n\n ",

            "content": "\n\tRemoved the byte written by SegmentInfo (hasSingleNormsFile - redundant).\n\tAdded live migration code to SI.ctor to read that byte if pre-4.0 index\n\tRenamed FORMAT_FLEX_POSTING to FORMAT_4_0. I think we should do this going forward in more places, so that it's clear to which version this format belongs and will make the task of removing support for old indexes in the future easier. The jdoc of the constant needs to describe what is covered by that format.\n\n\n\nBesides the Solr tests, everything passes.\n\nBTW, I don't think we should stop writing that byte in 3.1 - not sure if hasSingleNormsFile is always true, and even if so, 3.0 indexes still need to be supported and they write the byte. And it does not add much of complexity. ",

All I see is a comment and two methods that are used to generate the old indexes.\n\nFORMAT_4_0_FLEX_POSTINGS\n\nWhile I don't mind that sort of descriptiveness, it does not fit in all cases, such as this case \u2013 this format is related to both flex postings, but also to that byte removed from the SegmentInfo . So I think we should keep the names simple, and have a useful javadoc. It's the sort of constants no one really cares about in his daily work, only when you handle file format backwards stuff .\n\nAlso, if by chance (like this case, again) you get to change the file format version twice, by two different people, with long time interval between the two, a FORMAT_4_0 should alert you that that's used for the unreleased index, and so you don't need to bump it up again (here, jumping from -9 to -11) accidentally.
