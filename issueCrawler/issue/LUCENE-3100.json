    "description": "In making a unit test for NRTCachingDir (LUCENE-3092) I hit this surprising bug!\n\nBecause the new N.fnx file is written at the \"last minute\" along with the segments file, it's not included in the sis.files() that IW uses to figure out which files to sync.\n\nThis bug means one could call IW.commit(), successfully, return, and then the machine could crash and when it comes back up your index could be corrupted.\n\nWe should hopefully first fix TestCrash so that it hits this bug (maybe it needs more/better randomization?), then fix the bug....",

Since the fnx file is considered to be a real relative to the segments file its not in the SIS#files if you don't specify commmit==true so it doesn't get synced with other files during IW#prepareCommit. Phew, sneaky! I think we should sync that file upon successful write explicitly in SIS - possibly simple change but big bang ey  ",
