This is a little bit vague.\n\nOne idea for an improved message:  \"The solrconfig.xml file for this index does not have an operational dataimport handler defined.\"",

I'm aware that it is common to guide users towards thinking about a Solr core as a \"collection of documents\", but if we use explicit terminology, supporting Solr becomes easier. ",
