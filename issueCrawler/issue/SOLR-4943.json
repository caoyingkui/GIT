            "content": "Sorry, I didn't mean remove the URLs with the cores on them, I meant the constructor functions.  The URLs are all intercepted by SolrDispatchFilter and passed to the handlers on CoreContainer anyway, and that's fine.\n\nSo for example InfoHandler has a no-argument constructor, that sets this.cc to null.  If you use this constructor, you can never get useful information out of the InfoHandler - it will always throw a SolrException.  So it seems a bit pointless to have this constructor at all.\n\nAlso, some of these probably don't need to take CoreContainers at all.  SystemInfoHandler just uses it to determine if it's Zk-aware or not, which it could do as easily with a boolean passed to its constructor.  LoggingHandler could take a LogWatcher rather than a CoreContainer.  Makes it easier to test things, for a start.\n\nOIC, looking at it more closely, they need the no-arg constructors because they could be defined in solrconfig.xml as request handlers, and need to go through the normal construct/init/inform lifecycle.  So yes, we should probably open another issue to deprecate defining the handlers that are container-wide in individual core configs. "

This issue is not about removing the per core admin info - it's just about adding that info at the system level so that the UI can be reasonable when no SolrCores are defined. "

CoreAdminHandler's STATUS call seemed like a good place to return all of this info logic form, and had the added benefit of already being a \"special\" handler with special semantics and a solr.xml configurable path \u2013 hence the idea i floated in SOLR-4220.  \n\n(I know that between the collection admin paths and the restlet REST API paths we've already moved into the point of there being \"special\" paths that the user can't change in configuration \u2013 i'd just really like to avoid adding any more ... but I'm not going to fight hard for it.)\n\nOther then that, my concerns when looking at the patch...\n\n\n\tHaving InfoHandler explicitly wrap instances of the existing ThreadDumpHandler, PropertiesRequestHandler, LoggingHandler, and SystemInfoHandler scares me (because of the \"is CoreContainer null? is SolrCore null?\" situation) and seems overly complicated ... wouldn't it be just as easy to refactor the meat of these classes into static methods (or helper objects) that don't know about SolrQueryRequest and take in only hte specific item they need (CoreContainer in SystemInfoHandler's case, and LowWatcher in LoggingHandler's case, etc..) and then both InfoHandler and the original handlers could call/instantiate those helpers?\n\teither way, we need some tests of this new InfoHandler (otherwise i guarantee you someone down the road is going to add some code to one of these wrapped handlers that is going to cause an NPE because it assumes it has access to a SolrCore and it won't be caught until someone notices it in the UI)\n\t\n\t\twe also need more javadocs on all of the affected handlers noting the two differnet usage patterns.\n\t\n\t\n\twhy is there a change to SolrIndexSearcher in this patch?  ... it smells fishy ... is this a distinct bug that was discovered as part of your work on hte patch that should be fixed & release noted in a dedicated issue?\n\n "

I hate that the core admin handler url is configurable and in fact it breaks solrcloud if you configure it.\n\nCoreAdminHandler's STATUS call seemed like a good place to return\n\nPersonally, I don't like the idea of jamming these into the status call. I think they have a good structure now - they just should not be at the core level, but at the system level.\n\nbecause of the \"is CoreContainer null? is SolrCore null?\" situation) and seems overly complicated \n\nI think it's fairly simple atm - if it's bothersome, I'd prefer we just remove them at the core level for 5.0 rather than try and refactor it to be very slightly simpler code. \n\neither way, we need some tests \n\nYes of course we need tests.\n\nwhy is there a change to SolrIndexSearcher in this patch?\n\nIt's just an unrelated thing that got caught up in the patch.
