Two useful examples of pass through filters are custom access control filters and geo spatial filters.\n\nSyntax:\n\n\n.../sql?stmt=SELECT ...

Tests have been added for the different scenarios where the pass through occurs.\n\nThe new patch limits the pass through to filter queries only, as passing everything through was proving to be messy. I'll change the title of the ticket accordingly. ",
