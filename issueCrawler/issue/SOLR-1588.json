It's generally a good thing to not commit this type of code \u2013 if it's needed it can be looked up by the CM system for a prior revision. Trivial patch attached that removes the code block.\n\n(note I found this while trying to understand the FieldType hierarchy with the goal of working on SOLR-1586 to help out...)",
