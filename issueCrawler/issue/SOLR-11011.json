Although this was caught while testing autoAddReplicasPlanAction for autoscaling, it can happen today in the wild if a user uses the DELETEREPLICA or MOVEREPLICA or REPLACENODE API to delete replicas and then a new replica is created on the same node with the same core name.

That's the only place which needs this method and ZkController is a kitchen-sink already so let's not add another one there.\n\tInstead of adding new intToBytes and bytesToInt methods, why don't you store the number as a string and use Integer.parseInt?\n\tThe warning logged on BadVersionException should be a debug. We don't want to scare people unnecessarily if there was a conflict.\n\tThere's no need to catch InterruptedException, let it propagate up as it is.\n\tThe changes in addReplicaTest of CollectionsAPIDistributedZkTest do not seem to be related to this issue? Same for the changes in CollectionsAPISolrJTest.\n\n ",

I think the implementation for intToBytes and bytesToInt is trivial, even we store the number as a string, we still have to convert the string to bytes, I kinda like current approach.\n3. Sure, I will do that.\n4. If we throw InterruptedException, so we have to throw InterruptedException in Assign methods too which are propagated to several other methods. \n5. The changes are necessary because whenever we call Assign methods, we will increase the counter ( then the newReplicaName does not match with precomputed one ). So I solved the problem by grab replica name from the response. ",
