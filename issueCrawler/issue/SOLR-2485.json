    "description": "In SOLR-1566, we dramatically refactored the response writer framework \u2013 BaseResponseWriter, GenericBinaryResponseWriter, and GenericTextResponseWriter got left out in the cold because they don't have any tests and it is unclear how they are supposed to work.  With the new refactoring, I think the goals of these classes are better supported by extending BinaryResponseWriter and TextResponseWriter.\n\nin 3.x, these classes  should be deprecated and suggest using BinaryResponseWriter and TextResponseWriter",
