            "content": "Here is a patch. Similarity.coord and BooleanQuery.Builder.setDisableCoords are gone, which helped simplify BooleanWeight and our boolean scorers. The standard query parser had a special node for boolean queries with configurable disableCoord, which was only a way to handle synonyms in practice, so these nodes have been renamed to SynonymQueryNode (they are useful so that the default operator is not applied for boolean queries that represent synonyms). I did not change it to keep the change minimal but in the future it should probably switch to SynonymQuery. The rest of the patch is rather straightforward and just removes all calls to BooleanQuery.Builder.setDisableCoords. "
