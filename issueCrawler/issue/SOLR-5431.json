    "description": "If you don't define data-config.xml fields with the right casing the data import handler silently fails. The reason for this is because DocBuilder class line 627 takes into account the case of the db fields and therefore cannot find the field in the entity.\n\nSet<EntityField> field = entity.getColNameVsField().get(key)\n\nIt would be nice to have more logging to be able to understand why nothing was imported and that it was because no field in the entity could be found that matched the db columns.",
