    "description": "Currently when finding the best node to host the failed replicas, we respect the maxShardsPerNode property. This is not an ideal solution as it's a per collection property and we need a cluster wide property. Also using maxShardsPerNode can lead to unequal distribution of replicas across nodes.\n\nWe should just let users use the CLUSTERPROP API to set the max number of cores to be hosted on each node and use that value while picking the node the replica will be hosted on.",

This value is respected when finding nodes to host failed over replicas.\n\nI am not happy with the \"maxCoresPerNode\" name but that seemed like the most accurate name. \"maxReplicasPerNode\" might suggest this value does something similar to \"maxShardsPerNode\" ?\n\nI will add a test but wanted some feedback on the approach and the name for the property.

It's super cool!\n\nNew patch which adds a test for this property.\n\nCouple of other changes I made - \n\n\n\tModified a live node in testGetBestCreateUrlMultipleCollections(). I believe it was intended to be node2 and node1 in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\tIn this should the check be only for node3 since node2 is already hosting the replica. Unless \"r2-4\" meant node2 or node4\n\n\n\n\n    result = buildClusterState(\"csr1R*r2-4sr3r4r5\", NODE1, NODE2, NODE3);\n    createUrl = OverseerAutoReplicaFailoverThread.getBestCreateUrl(result.reader, result.badReplica, null);\n    assertTrue(createUrl.equals(NODE2_URL) || createUrl.equals(NODE3_URL));\n\n\n\n\nShould we keep the property name \"maxCoresPerNode\" or something else?\n ",

Unless \"r2-4\" meant node2 or node4\n\nI think that '-' notation has been removed (it's probably just ignored now). I think you used to specify the state that way. -4 prob would have been 'recovery failed' state.\n\nBut yeah, looks like it should just be NODE3 with that not working anymore.\n\nI'm guessing it's meant to be (now): \"csr1R*r2Fsr3r4r5\"\n\nShould we keep the property name \"maxCoresPerNode\" \n\nSounds reasonable to me.
