    "description": "We would like to add a Diversity SearchComponent/RequestHandler for Solr.\nWe will implement MMR(Maximal Marginal Relevance) which is one of the simplest algorithms for this problem, in the next version we will improve it.\n\nThe Idea is that you have a lot of similar documents in your search result (duplicates and near-duplicates that you must index) and the rank is showing all those documents one by one - it's a very common problem for organizations.\n\nWe need to return a bigger list of documents from the searcher (a parameter need to be chosen based on system performance) run MMR calculation in their scoring:\nlamda * OldRank + (1-lamda)*min_similarity\n{similarity of current document to the subset of documents already chosen to return in search results}\n\nlamda is parameter between 0-1 - the strong of the diversity.\nmin_similarity is calculated based on lucene default similarity (TF-IDF) for the subset of already chosen documents. \nThe new score will represent a combination of relevance score and diversity from other documents.",
