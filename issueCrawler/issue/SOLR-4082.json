    "description": "When adding a working core into a subversion repository, a \".svn\"-directory is created in \"$SOLR_HOME/solr/$CORE_NAME/data\".\n\nUpon restarting jetty (our servlet container), solr produces an error that at least one core should be available. Upon removing the \"$SOLR_HOME/SOLR/$core_name/data/.svn\"-directory, things work again. \n\nIn short: we can not add a complete core into SVN, which would be nice to do. If something can be implemented to ignore dot-directories in de data folder that would probably solve the issue.",
