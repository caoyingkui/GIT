    "description": "In http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/02/visualizing-lucenes-segment-merges.html Mike mentioned lookahead as something that could possibly yield more\noptimal merges.\n\nBut what about lookback?\n\nWhat if some sort of stats were kept about about which segments were\npicked for merges?  With some sort of stats in hand, could one look\nback and, knowing what happened after those merges, evaluate if more\noptimal merge choices could have been made and then use that \"next\ntime\"?\n\nSee http://search-lucene.com/m/D7ypz1gT2H91",
