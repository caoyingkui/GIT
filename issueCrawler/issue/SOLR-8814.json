    "description": "With minor changes, we can modify the existing JSON writer to produce a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` for ever SolrDocumentList.  We can then pick a field to use as the geometry type, and use that for the Feature#geometry\n\n\n\"response\":{\"type\":\"FeatureCollection\",\"numFound\":1,\"start\":0,\"features\":[\n      {\"type\":\"Feature\",\n        \"geometry\":{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[1,2]},\n        \"properties\":{\n          ... the normal solr doc fields here ...}}]\n  }}\n\n\n\nThis will allow adding solr results directly to various mapping clients like Leaflet\n\n\n\n\nThis patch will work with Documents that have a spatial field the either:\n1. Extends AbstractSpatialFieldType\n2. has a stored value with geojson\n2. has a stored value that can be parsed by spatial4j (WKT, etc)\n\nThe spatial field is identified with the parameter `geojson.field`",
