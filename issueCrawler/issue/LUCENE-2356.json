    "description": "Opening a place holder issue... if all the refactoring being discussed don't make this possible, then we should add a setting to IWC to do so.\n\nApps with very large numbers of unique terms must set the terms index divisor to control RAM usage.\n\n(NOTE: flex's RAM terms dict index RAM usage is more efficient, so this will help such apps).\n\nBut, when IW resolves deletes internally it always uses default 1 terms index divisor, and the app cannot change that.  Though one workaround is to call getReader(termInfosIndexDivisor) which will pool the reader with the right divisor.",
