    "description": "In looking at the Solr website it has many of the same issues that Lucene Java did when it comes to ASF policies about nightly builds, etc. concerning the Javadocs  \n\nSee http://lucene.markmail.org/message/a7k7kujxkhwjwfy6?q=nightly+developer+releases+list:org%2Eapache%2Elucene%2Ejava-dev+from:%22Doug+Cutting+(JIRA)%22&page=1\nand http://lucene.markmail.org/message/vaks6omed4l6buth?q=nightly+developer+releases+list:org%2Eapache%2Elucene%2Ejava-dev+from:%22Doug+Cutting+(JIRA)%22&page=1\n\nThis would suggest a change like Hadoop and Lucene Java did to separate out the main site, release docs (javadocs, any other?) and developer resources.  Currently the javadocs on the main page are the nightly and should be made less prominent.",

This is used for all javadoc targets now for uniformity.\n\n\n\nNext steps would be to change the site to move the nightly builds and javadocs inside a \"Development\" section like Hadoop's site. "

That needs to be changed to the 1.3 release javadocs.\n\tA new \"Development\" section needs to be created which should have links to the nightly builds and javadocs\n\tThe nightly build download link needs to be moved off the front page \"news\" section\n\n\n\nI guess I can finish these off this week. Is the hudson build for 1.3 release still up or should I just re-create those javadocs from the tag and scp them? "
