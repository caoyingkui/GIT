If DOT is specified to be US-ASCII, it should use a PrintWriter that is instantiated using US-ASCII as charset (PrintStream uses platform default, and that may be Big5 or other ugly things). In my opinion, the method should take a PrintWriter and a possible File/OutputStream method should be hardcoded to US-ASCII. ",

Keeping both options open seems good?  (Though, I lack intuition on when the non-layered (old way) option would be better... maybe we default to the new way?). ",
