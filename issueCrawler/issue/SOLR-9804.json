            "content": "From a quick test I just did, I think this is a valid issue.\n\nI created a simple security.json with 3 users - \"solr\", \"tom\", and \"harry\" (below). User \"harry\" only has read permissions (from his role as \"read\", and \"read\" only has read permissions). Harry is able to use certain search request handlers, but not /update.\n\nI was able to post a document as Harry with:\n\n\ncurl -u harry:passhash -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://localhost:8983/solr/apitest/update/json/docs' --data-binary '{\"id\": \"1\",\"title\": \"Doc 1\"}'\n\n\n\nAs Harry, I cannot get into the Admin UI (expected) but I can query /select (also expected). However, since Harry doesn't have /update permissions (only Tom and Solr have those permissions), he should not be able to send in documents.\n\nFor example, here is Harry searching for the document he just posted: \n\n\n$ curl -u harry:passhash 'http://localhost:8983/solr/apitest/select?q=id:1&wt=json'\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"zkConnected\":true,\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":20,\n    \"params\":{\n      \"q\":\"id:1\",\n      \"wt\":\"json\"}},\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":1,\"start\":0,\"maxScore\":0.2876821,\"docs\":[\n      {\n        \"id\":\"1\",\n        \"title\":[\"Doc 1\"],\n        \"_version_\":1561161422757429248}]\n  }}\n\n\n\nHere's the security.json I used:\n\n{\n  \"authentication\":{\n    \"blockUnknown\":true,\n    \"class\":\"solr.BasicAuthPlugin\",\n    \"credentials\":{\n      \"solr\":\"IV0EHq1OnNrj6gvRCwvFwTrZ1+z1oBbnQdiVC3otuq0= Ndd7LKvVBAaZIF0QAVi1ekCfAJXr1GGfLtRUXhgrF8c=\",\n      \"tom\":\"wBrPpz6vFxaxnceWraPuiEO1nRMi1M+JwozO9gRb83c= fP+2j4E89Y52aemEIGyVOOWiM/8OrXjSp63Ms2372Fc=\",\n      \"harry\":\"pNM5TpCotk3FhQWiHPCHghMLMDZIYcz4vI+b8pA35Fc= cT0BonmFYVydtL9VuKmoLkndw4ycyESoEX3BC8rXwBg=\"},\n    \"\":{\"v\":6}},\n  \"authorization\":{\n    \"class\":\"solr.RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin\",\n    \"permissions\":[\n      {\n        \"name\":\"all\",\n        \"role\":\"admin\",\n        \"index\":1},\n      {\n        \"collection\":null,\n        \"name\":\"update\",\n        \"role\":\"dev\",\n        \"index\":2},\n      {\n        \"collection\":null,\n        \"name\":\"read\",\n        \"role\":\"read\",\n        \"index\":3}],\n    \"user-role\":{\n      \"solr\":\"admin\",\n      \"tom\":[\"dev\"],\n      \"harry\":[\"read\"]},\n    \"\":{\"v\":7}}}\n\n ",

Or possibly a mix?\n\nThe reason I ask is because using the security.json you supplied, I got the same results - the \"solr\" user is able to send documents to the index. If I remove the last line of the file  - \"\":{\"v\":138} - the permissions work properly and the \"solr\" user gets a 403 Unauthorized error. \n\nI tested with fresh installs of 6.3.0, 6.4.2 and a SNAPSHOT build of 6.5.0 and in each case, I got the expected behavior. However, trying to download the existing file, hand-edit it and then re-upload it without removing that last line caused unexpected behavior, including being able to update documents when I'd changed the permissions to deny the user that permission.\n\nIf you could share more about your workflow with this file, that would help.

Every (ZK, I think?) node checks the version number and if it has not changed it doesn't get updated. Unfortunately, you don't really have any idea what version of the file is really being used, because the one you can see (I was using the Tree view in the Admin UI) looks like the right one.\n\nAnother thing I found, but I'm not sure it's causing a real problem: using the collection:null parameter for the read and update pre-configured permissions is incorrect. The documentation is incomplete on this - I'd say it's bad, actually - but that parameter is never required for any of the pre-configured permissions, it's always assumed to be either collection:null or, for read and update permissions, collection:* .
