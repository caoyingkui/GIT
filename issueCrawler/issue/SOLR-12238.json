    "description": "This improvement is built on top of the Synonym Query Style feature and brings the possibility of boosting synonym queries using the payload associated.\n\nIt introduces two new modalities for the Synonym Query Style :\n\n\n\nPICK_BEST_BOOST_BY_PAYLOAD -> build a Disjunction query with the clauses boosted by payload\n\nAS_DISTINCT_TERMS_BOOST_BY_PAYLOAD\u00a0-> build a Boolean\u00a0query with the clauses boosted by payload\n\nThis new synonym query styles will assume payloads are available so they must be used in conjunction with a token filter able to produce payloads.\n\nAn synonym.txt example could be :\n\n\n\tSynonyms used by Payload Boost\ntiger => tiger|1.0, Big_Cat|0.8, Shere_Khan|0.9\nleopard => leopard, Big_Cat|0.8, Bagheera|0.9\nlion => lion|1.0, panthera leo|0.99, Simba|0.8\nsnow_leopard => panthera uncia|0.99, snow leopard|1.0\n\n\n\nA simple token filter to populate the payloads from such synonym.txt is :\n\n<filter class=\"solr.DelimitedPayloadTokenFilterFactory\" encoder=\"float\" delimiter=\"|\"/>",

            "content": "Erik Hatcher thanks !\n\n1) at the moment this implementation is entirely query time. When parsing (building) the query the payload for the synonym is used to build a boosted synonym query.\n\nGiven that, an index time approach can be interesting and could work.\n Why you mentioned the delimiters could cause issues?\n The payload weight should be in the output synonyms, so they should not cause any matching problem.\n\nApplying this at indexing time should imply a modification in the similarity function including a\u00a0variant payload sensible ( such as\u00a0PayloadBM25Similarity ).\n Taking a look to org.apache.lucene.search.similarities.BM25Similarity I noticed this :\n\n/** The default implementation returns <code>1</code> */\n protected float scorePayload(int doc, int start, int end, BytesRef payload)\n\n{ return 1; }\n\nSo maybe someone already started something in that direction.\n I will investigate and possibly open another Jira to track the Index Time implementations.\n\n2) I have\u00a0just tried it and it is OK.\nI first added the weighted synonyms (with separator) with a REST PUT and verified the managed synonym map was correct ( I just pushed the additional test in the Github Pull Request).\n\nThen I just double checked ManagedSynonymGraphFilter builds the same graph than the not managed version and I was able to see a proper behaviour in extracting the payload ",
