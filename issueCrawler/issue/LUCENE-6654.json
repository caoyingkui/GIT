    "description": "Currently the KNN Classifier assign the score for a ClassificationResult, based only on the frequency of the class in the top K results.\n\nThis is conceptually a simplification.\nActually the ranking must take a part.\n\nIf not this can happen :\n\nTop 4\n1) Class1\n2) Class1\n3) Class2\n4) Class2\n\nAs a result of this Top 4 , both the classes will have the same score.\nBut the expected result is that Class1 has a better score, as the MLT score the documents accordingly.",
