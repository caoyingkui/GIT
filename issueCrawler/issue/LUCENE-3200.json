    "description": "Robert and me discussed a little bit after Mike's investigations, that using SingleMMapIndexinput together with MultiMMapIndexInput leads to hotspot slowdowns sometimes.\n\nWe had the following ideas:\n\n\tMultiMMapIndexInput is almost as fast as SingleMMapIndexInput, as the switching between buffer boundaries is done in exception catch blocks. So normal code path is always the same like for Single*\n\tOnly the seek method uses strange calculations (the modulo is totally bogus, it could be simply: int bufOffset = (int) (pos % maxBufSize); - very strange way of calculating modulo in the original code)\n\tBecause of speed we suggest to no longer use arbitrary buffer sizes. We should pass only the power of 2 to the indexinput as size. All calculations in seek and anywhere else would be simple bit shifts and AND operations (the and masks for the modulo can be calculated in the ctor like NumericUtils does when calculating precisionSteps).\n\tthe maximum buffer size will now be 2^30, not 2^31-1. But thats not an issue at all. In my opinion, a buffer size of 2^31-1 is stupid in all cases, as it will no longer fit page boundaries and mmapping gets harder for the O/S.\n\n\n\nWe will provide a patch with those cleanups.",

I added hasRemaining() there, so its consistent with readBytes.\n\tThe check for an invalid power was bogus (0 is allowed, leads to buffer size 1)\n\tThe check for RandomAccessFile too big for maximum buffer size did not respect the additional buffer. nrBuffers can then overflow easily\n\n ",
