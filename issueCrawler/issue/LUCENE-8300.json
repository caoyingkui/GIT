    "description": "Matt Weber pointed out on LUCENE-8196 that Intervals.unordered() doesn't check to see if its subintervals overlap, which means that for example Intervals.unordered(Intervals.term(\"a\"), Intervals.term(\"a\")) would match a document with a appearing only once.  This ticket will introduce a new function, Intervals.unordered_distinct(), that ensures that all subintervals within an unordered interval do not overlap.",

            "content": "distinct is a bit misleading because you check for overlaps here and not distinct intervals so maybe something like unorderedNonOverlapping ? That's verbose but more easy to understand . \nCan you also add tests for other cases than just repeating the same term ? The new source should be able to find unordered intervals that don't overlap from Intervals.unordered(Intervals.phrase(\"the world cup\"), Intervals.term(\"world\"), Intervals.term(\"cup\")) which is different than just finding duplicates interval of different sources.
