    "description": "I noticed that the RawRequestHandler can NOT properly serve up binary data like images, only textual documents.  I dug around for a while and it appears that reading in content via Streams, but sending them out via Writer doesn't work, because of character encoding problems.   \n\nI wanted RawRequestHandler to work with binary images because the /browse handler in 3.x uses some autocomplete functionality that looks for a \"indicator.gif\" in the /velocity directory.   And I'd like to be able to add other binary images to my velocity based search interface.   \n\nAfter much digging around, I realized that if I made RawResponseWriter implement BinaryQueryResponseWriter, then everything works.  I was able to stream both binary images and text documents to the browser.   \n\nNot sure if this is the right path to go, and if there are other ramifications that I don't grok on making this change, so wanted to put it up for discussion.",
