    "description": "I think that I found a bug in DELETE collectionAPI command.\n\nEnvironment:\n\n\tN boxes, the number is not important.\n\tA collection with N shard spreed over the N boxes.\n\tSolr.xml old style.\n\n\n\nI ran the command as http://localhost:8983/sorl/admin/collections?action=DELETE&name=CollectionX\n\nThe command return a 200 all was cleaned and in theory the collection was removed ... but for some reason, one of the boxes doesn't delete the references of CollectionX from the solr.xml and the folders of cores still exists. The clusterstate.json doesn't have the CollectionX and the /collections doesn't show the collectionX either.\n\nThis result of this situation is an exception in overseer queue loop like this:\n\norg.apache.solr.cloud.Overseer$ClusterStateUpdater; Exception in Overseer main queue loop\n\nThis exception stuck the queue and stoping the cluster. I think that is easy replicate it with a test case.\n\nI think that before to send an ok in DELETE command we must ensure that nothing about this collection still existing on the cluster.",
