    "description": "This TokenFilter is able to split a token based on a delimiter and use one part as the token and the other part as a payload.  This allows someone to include payloads inline with tokens (presumably setup by a pipeline ahead of time).  An example is apropos.  Given a | delimiter, we could have a stream that looks like:\nThe quick|JJ red|JJ fox|NN jumped|VB over the lazy|JJ brown|JJ dogs|NN\n\nIn this case, this would produce tokens and payloads (assuming whitespace tokenization):\nToken: the\nPayload: null\n\nToken: quick\nPayload: JJ\n\nToken: red\nPay: JJ.\n\nand so on.\n\nThis patch will also support pluggable encoders for the payloads, so it can convert from the character array to byte arrays as appropriate.",

However, the Float.parseInt implementation relies on some constructs that are not available in JDK 1.4, so that one is going to have to stay as it is.\n\nThe main problem lies in the reliance on the HexStringParser (https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/classlib/archive/java6/modules/luni/src/main/java/org/apache/harmony/luni/util/HexStringParser.java) which is in need of some Long specific attributes that are either >JDK1.4 or are Harmony specific attributes of Long (I didn't take the time to investigate)\n\nAt any rate, I added the Integer stuff to ArrayUtils and also added some tests.\n\nFor reference, see: \nhttps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/classlib/archive/java6/modules/luni/src/main/java/org/apache/harmony/luni/util/FloatingPointParser.java\n\nhttps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/classlib/archive/java6/modules/luni/src/main/java/java/lang/Integer.java\n ",
