Call 'C' 'Collection' and 'c' 'core'?\n\nIf this stuff will be repeated in every log line, I like the fact that it's short, and that should actually enhance readability once you get used to it.\n\nThere is some other redundant info now though:  C17 P62757\nThat's the core number and the port number.  Both where important in the past (along with the thread number) to figuring out chaos monkey test fails.  But they don't seem important for production?  The port number should be different for diff log files in production, and the collection name we already have. ",
