            "content": "I don't know if this first stab will be useful to anyone else or not, but it might be slightly easier to get started with than writing your own. Limitations include:\n\n\n\tNo ability to configure qsol (even though qsol is highly configurable) \u2013 you're stuck with the defaults\n\tThis doesn't alter qsol itself at all, so you don't get support for certain Solr goodies, like function queries\n\n\n\nUsage:\n\n\n\tThis patch creates <solrroot>/contrib/qsol.\n\tDownload qsol from the qsol home page and put qsol jar into <solrroot>/contrib/qsol/lib\n\tcd <solrroot>/contrib/qsol\n\tRun ant (no args needed) to create the qsol Solr plugin (<solrroot>/contrib/qsol/build/apache-solr-qsol-1.4-dev.jar or some such)\n\tTo deploy, copy both the qsol Solr plugin jar and qsol.jar to your solr lib directory. In the example jetty setup that comes with solr, that should be <solrroot>/example/solr/lib/. In a multicore setup, you can specify where the lib directory is in solr.xml.\n\tThere are a few different ways to make qsol accessible from Solr now. One is to add <queryParser name=\"qsol\" class=\"org.apache.solr.search.QsolQParserPlugin\"/> to your solrconfig.xml, and then to prepend \"\n{!qsol}\" to your queries URLs, e.g. \"...?q={!qsol}\nterm1 | term2\". See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPlugins for more info.\n\n "
