    "description": "Usually when you pull an NRT reader, you want all deletes to be applied.\n\nBut in some expert cases you may not need it (eg you just want to validate that the doc was indexed).  Since it's costly to apply deletes, and trivial to add this boolean (we already have a boolean internally), I think we should add it.\n\nThe deletes are still buffered, and you can always later pull another reader (for \"real\" searching) with deletes applied.",
