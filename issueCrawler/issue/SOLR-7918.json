            "content": "Patch attached..  This also introduces a DocSetProducer interface (ported from Heliosearch) to form a basis for future optimizations.\n\nThe actual set building was moved out to DocSetUtil from SolrIndexSearcher to avoid bloating that class more.\n\nPerformance improvements were quite good. On the low end was large SortedInt sets (only a 20% improvement), but large sets saw a 70% improvement and very small sets saw over 120% improvement.  Complete request+response was measured from the client, so the speedups were actually even greater. ",

I have some feedback:\n\n\tWas there really any benefit to initializing the FixedBitSet manually versus simply creating it and calling set() ?  If not it's more clear to simply use the methods on FBS.\n\tI saw the size threshold numerous times \u2014 maxDoc >> 6 + 5.  Could this go into a utility method to not repeat yourself?\n\tThe private method createDocSetByIterator appears unused.  What's the story there?\n\n ",

            "content": "Was there really any benefit to initializing the FixedBitSet manually versus simply creating it and calling set() ?\n\nYep, there did seem to be a perf increase... it happens sometimes.  See BooleanScorer as well:\n\n  // This is basically an inlined FixedBitSet... seems to help with bound checks\n  final long[] matching = new long[SET_SIZE];\n\n\n\nI saw the size threshold numerous times \u2014 maxDoc >> 6 + 5.\n\nYeah, that actually appears in other places (like SolrIndexSearcher) too, and sometimes just as maxDoc>>6.  They should all arguably have a small constant added for better test coverage of both small and large DocSets.\n\nThe private method createDocSetByIterator appears unused. What's the story there?\n\nI started off by just porting DocSetUtil, but this code isn't used (yet).  It can be removed for now. ",
