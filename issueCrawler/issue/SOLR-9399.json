I'll create a separate jira to refactor the code and also tests for authentication seems to be broken. \n\n    The test class BasicAuthIntegrationTest doesn't have any test methods except the protected method doExtraTests which doesn't seems to be called from anywhere and delete tests needs to be added.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/susheelks/lucene-solr SOLR-9399\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/69.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #69\n\n\ncommit 7c68a42728531775240c7b6ff2bad5a23dfdb255\nAuthor: Kumar, Susheel (CORP) <susheel.kumar@adp.com>\nDate:   2016-08-11T00:57:49Z\n\n    Added call to setBasicAuthCredentials for delete request\n\n ",
