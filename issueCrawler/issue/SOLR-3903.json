Meanwhile I'm posting this bug to let you know.\n\n\n\n\nConcurrentUpdateSolrServer server = new ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer(\"http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1\", 2, 2);\nUpdateRequest updateRequest = new UpdateRequest();\nSolrInputDocument document = new SolrInputDocument();\nupdateRequest.add(document);\nupdateRequest.setAction(UpdateRequest.ACTION.COMMIT, false, false);\nserver.request(updateRequest);\nserver.commit();",
