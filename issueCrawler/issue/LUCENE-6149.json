There is no way to change this despite the options and improvement of LUCENE-6050, made to incorporate Boolean lookup clauses (MUST/SHOULD). This shortcoming has also been reported in SOLR-6648.\n\nThe suggesters (AnalyzingInfixSuggester, BlendedInfixSuggester) should provide a proper mechanism to set defaults for highlighting and \"allTermsRequired\", e.g. in constructors (and in Solr factories, thus configurable via solrconfig.xml).",
