    "description": "In Searchable.java, the javadoc for maxdoc() is:\n\n  /** Expert: Returns one greater than the largest possible document number.\n\n\tCalled by search code to compute term weights.\n\t@see org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader#maxDoc()\n\n\n\nThe qualification \"expert\" and the statement \"called by search code to compute term weights\" is a bit confusing, It implies that maxdoc() somehow computes weights, which is obviously not true (what it does is explained in the other sentence). Maybe it is used as one factor of the weight, but do we really need to mention this here?",

Or re word.\n\n\"This is used as an approximation of the number of documents in the index for scoring calculations.\"\n\nOr something to that effect (namely, better). Perhaps approximation isnt even needed - \n\n\"Because un-merged deleted docs still contribute to index statistics, this is used as the number of documents in the index for scoring calculations.\"\n\nor ...
