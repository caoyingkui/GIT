    "description": "The Atomic Updates feature currently suppors add/inc/set. A min & max modifier would allow for conditional updates: update if new value is smaller/greater than the current value. This is much more convenient than fetching the document, comparing the values and then sending an update.\n\nThe patch seems to work, but probably requires more testing. \n\nPull request: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/39",
