You'll see that the Lucene developers are very well mannered and get no results. Now try entering the word \"string\". That should return a whole bunch of documents. The results will page at every tenth result and ask you whether you want more results.\n\n...but thanks to files like \"KStemData*.java\" and \"Top50KWiki.utf8\" i was really hard pressed to find an (english) swear word that didn't result in a match in any of the files in the lucene code base (and i have a pretty extensive breadth of knowledge of profanity)\n\nWe should change this paragraph to refer to something that is total giberish (\"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\")... or maybe just \"nocommit\"\n\n(side note: since this para exists in the javadoc package comments, it will get picked up when they index the source \u2013 so we should include an HTML comment in the middle of whatever word is picked)",
