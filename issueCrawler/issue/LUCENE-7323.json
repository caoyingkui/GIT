It fixes our default\nLucene50CompoundFileFormat to verify the checksum of its sub-files\nwhen writing.\n\nI also had to close up external access to SimpleText's doc values and\npostings format, i.e., you must use them only via SimpleTextCodec,\nbecause these files (intentionally) don't write codec headers and\nfooters so you can't put them into a \"normal\" CFS file (SimpleText has\nits own CFS that doesn't verify checksums).\n\nI also made CodecUtil.read/writeCRC package private: do they\nreally need to be public?
