Brian Demers enabled o.a.lucene and o.a.solr in the Nexus repo (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4497), and I successfully uploaded Lucene snapshot artifacts for 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT using Maven Ant Tasks.  I attempted to use an encrypted password in ~/.m2/settings.xml, but that failed, apparently because Maven Ant Tasks doesn't (yet) grok encrypted passwords (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MANTTASKS-177).  So I switched back to a plaintext password, but now I'm getting 401 errors from Nexus when I try to deploy Solr snapshots, or to re-deploy the Lucene snapshots.  I suspect Nexus has locked my account out (sarowe), but I'm not sure - can anybody here help?\n\nNo response yet. ",
