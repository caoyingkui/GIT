Should the scheduling functionality in SnapPuller really move to ReplicationHandler? ",

Yeah, this entire stats business is actually the only thing which makes me nervous about removing temp as well. tempSnapPuller is assigned to snapPuller at the end, so you won't be calling it on a destroyed object, but I need to figure out what the intent of the stats is \u2013 is it for the last doFetch call done by replicate, or something else? If it's the former, what's snapPuller doing? ",

The temp puller is kept around for stat calls as mentioned above currently.\n\nWhile we might improve some of that, I think this is correct for the current code. ",
