    "description": "When performing field collapsing, it is occasionally desirable to filter out groups which have fewer than a given number of matches. So, for example:\n\nq=solr+memory&group=true&group.field=manu_exact&group.min=3\n\nwould group on 'manu_exact', but exclude groups where numFound is less than 3.\n\nSee also this stackoverflow question:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9377743/how-to-retrieve-solr-documents-having-at-least-2-numfound-with-grouping",
