            "content": "Sigh.  This looks like a compiler incompatibility between 1.3 and 1.4, where 1.4\nfixed a bug in the 1.3 compiler.  If you compile in 1.4, things should run fine\nin 1.3.  Our primary goal should be to make sure that the compiled code runs in\nearlier releases.  But it would also be best if it compiles in these releases too...\n\nIn this case, I can't see a way around this without changing the anonymous class\ninto a named inner class whose constructor throws IOException.  For example:\n\n  public Spans getSpans(final IndexReader reader) throws IOException \n{\n    return new FirstSpans(reader);\n  }\n  private class FirstSpans implements Spans {\n    private Spans spans;\n    public FirstSpans(IndexReader reader) throws IOException \n{\n      this.spans = match.getSpans(reader);\n    }\n    ... the rest of the methods ... \n  }\n\nDoes this work correctly in 1.3?  Does that look like the best fix to others?\n\n ",

            "content": "Doug,\n\nI was thinking along the same lines (creating a named inner class, guessing \nthat it was a 1.4 issue).  However, the dynamic creation of inner classes has \nalways been difficult for me to understand, let alone change.  Even when I \nsimply nulled-out the offending lines, more compile errors emerged.  I have no \nidea how far this will cascade.   \n\nHowever, if you can compile it as is in 1.4 and run it in 1.3, that is a \nworkaround.  (Can anyone quickly check this out?)\n\nBut I think some kind of additional controls need to be implemented (for the \ncurrent situation and others in the future) that we don't accidently introduce \na JVM dependency.  If we do that on purpose, then we can try to figure out the \nimpact without a surprise. ",
