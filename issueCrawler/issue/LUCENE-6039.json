            "content": "Patch, tests pass, but this is really quite a dangerous change since I\ncould easily (and likely did) miss places in the code that still think\nnull means \"not indexed\" or \"no doc values\".\n\nI tried adding @NotNull annotations and ran code inspection with\nIntellij but was unable to get anything useful out of it: blatant\nviolations weren't caught, and trivial things were caught, or maybe\nI just ran it wrong...  If anyone has experience getting @NotNull/NonNull\nto report useful issues please help \n\nI also pulled DocValuesType and IndexOptions out of FieldInfo.java\ninto their own sources (in oal.index), and renamed\nIndexOptions.DOCS_ONLY -> DOCS.

To me the other worst thing is the \"null\" Scorer or \"null\" DocIdSets.... To me a query hitting no docs, should return an Empty Scorer implementation. "
