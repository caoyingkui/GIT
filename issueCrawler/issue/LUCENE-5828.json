    "description": "Currently we have some IndexInputs which do not have a separate slice() implementation. Those are using BufferedIndexInput#wrap(), which extends BufferedInputStream. This is nonsense, because the underlying IndexInput is in most cases already Buffered, and if not, its not needed.\n\nThis issue will change SlicedIndexInput to directly delegate, correcting offsets. The new class SlicedIndexInput will be top level and public.",

The slice wrapper is not used in any core directories, so maybe we should leave it as it is. I added a warning in the previous issue, but for already slow IndexInputs like HDFS I don't care.\n\nI will close this issue as won't fix. The bounds checks are the issue. We could make it faster by let it delegating all read calls, but I don't think its worth. ",
