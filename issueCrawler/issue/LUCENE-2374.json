    "description": "AttributeSource/TokenStream inspection in Solr needs to have some insight into the contents of AttributeImpls. As LUCENE-2302 has some problems with toString() [which is not structured and conflicts with CharSequence's definition for CharTermAttribute], I propose an simple API that get a default implementation in AttributeImpl (just like toString() current):\n\n\n\tIterator<Map.Entry<String,?>> AttributeImpl.contentsIterator() returns an iterator (for most attributes its a singleton) of a key-value pair, e.g. \"term\">\"foobar\",\"startOffset\">Integer.valueOf(0),...\n\tAttributeSource gets the same method, it just concat the iterators of each getAttributeImplsIterator() AttributeImpl\n\n\n\nNo backwards problems occur, as the default toString() method will work like before (it just gets iterator and lists), but we simply remove the documentation for the format. (Char)TermAttribute gets a special impl fo toString() according to CharSequence and a corresponding iterator.\n\nI also want to remove the abstract hashCode() and equals() methods from AttributeImpl, as they are not needed and just create work for the implementor.",

The default toString() [if not overridden] would simply call this method, too and pass a Fake-Map to the addToMap() method to populate a StringBuilder in Map.put() [to not automatically create a real Map always).\n\nCode in analysis.jsp would simply pass a map (e.g. a LinkedHashMap to preserve order) and then print it out. The values in the map are native types / or CharSequence for (Char)TermAttribute.\n\nThe only problem with this aproach would be that the attribute keys must be unique - an idea would be to prefix them with the attribute name.\n\nI will also remove the abstract equals() and hashCode() in AttributeImpl - the attribute API does not rely on them to be implemented - this simplyfies implementation of attributes, because equals/hashCode are never used. In 4.0 I would remove this from all custom attributes.\n\nWhat do you think? ",
