            "content": "This is not a bug.\n\nLucene 3.0 changed the stored fields to no longer support compressed fields. To mark an already \"converted\" (removed compression) stored fields file, the version is upgraded to the 3.0 one. Lucene 2.9 is then no longer able to read the index because of the upgraded version.\n\nTheoretically it could - when i implemented the stored field upgrade with Michael Busch, I thought about adding support for the higher version as an \"alias\" to 2.9, but the release schedule for 2.9 was too fast. The best solution would be to force 2.9 to always write stored field segments with the old version, but 2.9 should also be able to readonly the new version signature. ",
