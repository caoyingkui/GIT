    "description": "It is often useful to be able to restrict down the results of auto suggest, spell checking, term components to only show results that are in documents that are in a filter.  For instance, in multitenant solutions, it is common to mix content from multiple clients into the same index and then use filters to restrict the search space.  This, however, does not happen for things like auto-suggest, spell checking etc. so it often happens that one gets suggestions for terms that are not in the filtered set.  If we could use a filter when giving suggestions, spellings, etc. we could then only show values that the user is guaranteed to be able to see.",
