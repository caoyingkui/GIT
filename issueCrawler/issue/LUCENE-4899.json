            "content": "thanks koji for looking at it. Yet, I think we shouldn't fix this in the way I proposed it in the previous patch. I rather think if we have a single phrase that is greater than the fragCharSize we should just not highlight that passage at all. This is more conservative here and I think the correct thing to do otherwise we can easily end up with phrases way bigger than the fragment char size. I tried to simplify this BaseFragListBuilder a bit and make this entire behaviour pluggable so folks can decide if they want to risk the size of the fragments to explode? \n\nkoji can you take a look at this again?
