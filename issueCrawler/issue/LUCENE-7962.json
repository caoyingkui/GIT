    "description": "Distance computation for GeoPaths properly computes distance as distance along the route PLUS the perpendicular distance from the route to the point in question.  That is fine but there is another use case for GeoPaths, which is to compute distance along the route without the perpendicular leg.\n\nThe proposal is to add a method for GeoPath implementations only that computes this distance.",
