In such a scenario, The suggestion framework would perform the following steps\u00a0\n\n\tCheck if there are violations and try to make suggestions to existing nodes, if not possible\n\tSimulate\u00a0addition of a new extra node\n\tGo to step #1 assuming this simulated node is present in the list of nodes\n\tThere are 3 possibilities\n\t\n\t\tThe violation is completely gone\n\t\tThe violation has become less serious\n\t\tThe violation has not come down or it has become more serious\n\t\n\t\n\tIn case of #4.1 recommend to add a single node (or multiple nodes depending upon the no:of evaluations).
