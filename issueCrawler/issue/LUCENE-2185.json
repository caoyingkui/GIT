            "content": "The justification for using @Deprecated, AFAICT, is that conforming compilers are required to issue warnings for each so-annotated class/method, where compilers are not required to issue warnings for javadoc @deprecated tags, and although Sun compilers do this, other vendors' compilers might not.\n\nAnother (similarly theoretical) argument in favor of using @Deprecated annotations is that, unlike @deprecated javadoc tags, this annotation is available via runtime reflection.\n\nA random information point: MYFACES-2135 removed all @Deprecated annotations from MyFaces code because an apparent bug in the Sun TCK flags methods bearing this annotation as changing method signatures.

            "content": "Steven, yeah i know theoretically why this is here, but it is completely stupid.\n\n@Deprecated is a gigantic mistake, requiring me to write it twice, once lowercase in the javadocs, once uppercase as an annotation. This is the only way to properly deprecate something with a message as to why.\n\nand so this additional work buys me nothing, except some theoretical workaround to sun's piss-poor broken language design.\n\nthis being said, i still think we should be consistent: either remove all these annotations or add them all, and not just use them 'sometime'.
