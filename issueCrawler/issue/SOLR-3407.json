    "description": "When specifying a field name that starts with a digit (or digits) in the \"fl\" parameter solr returns both the field name and field value as the those digits. For example, using nightly build \"apache-solr-4.0-2012-04-24_08-27-47\" I run: \n\njava -jar start.jar \nand \njava -jar post.jar solr.xml monitor.xml \n\nIf I then add a field to the field list that starts with a digit ( localhost:8983/solr/select?q=:&fl=24 ) the results look like: \n... \n<doc>\n<long name=\"24\">24</long>\n</doc>\n... \n\nif I try fl=24_7 it looks like everything after the underscore is truncated \n... \n<doc>\n<long name=\"24\">24</long>\n</doc>\n... \n\nand if I try fl=3test it looks like everything after the last digit is truncated \n... \n<doc>\n<long name=\"3\">3</long>\n</doc>\n... \n\nIf I have an actual value for that field (say I've indexed 24_7 to be \"true\" ) I get back that value as well as the behavior above. \n... \n<doc>\n<bool name=\"24_7\">true</bool>\n<long name=\"24\">24</long>\n</doc>\n...",

Some kind of validation would help (SOLR-3207) but it's not trivial to do since there are dynamic fields too; I think Solr should guarantee that allowed field names always work, or at least make clearer what restrictions there are.
