Hiding returning the managed schema file for admin/file caused a test to fail where the managed schema was being fetched by the file request handler and its contents examined. Is this OK?\n\nI suppose I could allow this file to be returned in the GUI, but then cause an error to happen when people tried to write it, but since the test is the only place that uses the admin/file handler that I see (so far, still testing) that wants to get the contents anyway, it feels like making a special case for the test code is wrong. What do you think? "

Let me know if this violates the intent of the test, otherwise I'll check it in.\n\nSo now all the tests that were there are back.\n\nI can actually argue that going directly to ZooKeeper is, in fact, a better thing to do but that's almost a philosophical discussion.
