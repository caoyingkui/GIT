    "description": "I think the UnifiedHighlighter should be the default in 8.0.  It's faster and more accurate than alternatives.\n\nThe original highlighter however has some benefits:\n\n\tDifferent passage/snippet delineation options; somewhat more flexible.  Though no i18n BreakIterator based one.\n\tSeems to handle some \"special\" Queries and/or QueryParsers by default better \u2013 namely SurroundQParser.  Though SOLR-12895 will address this UH issue.\n\tConsiders boosts in the query when computing a passage score\n\thl.alternateField, hl.maxAlternateFieldLength, hl.highlightAlternate options.  Instead the UH has hl.defaultSummary boolean\n\n\n\nSee https://builds.apache.org/job/Solr-reference-guide-master/javadoc/highlighting.html",
