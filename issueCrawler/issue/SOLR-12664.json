    "description": "The buttons at the bottom of each page of the Ref Guide (that allow the user to nav to the next or previous pages) are rather large and really orange. I think we could do better with a more subtle approach.\n\nAdditionally, if the next page has a long title, the wrapping of the footer is a mess. See https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_4/uploading-data-with-solr-cell-using-apache-tika.html for an example.",

This uses the Bootstrap.js row definition to force the nav to span the width of the page. This solves the problem of weird wrapping with the footer if a page title is long.\n\tChanges the nav buttons:\n\t\n\t\tTransparent fill\n\t\tText and arrow icons are bold orange\n\t\tBox border is a light gray\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nA screenshot is also attached that shows the new styling.
