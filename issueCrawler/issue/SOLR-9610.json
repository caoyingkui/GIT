    "description": "Moving some code from SOLR-7826 over here. This is a new AssertTool which can be used to assert that we are (not) root user and more. Usage:\n\n\nusage: bin/solr assert [-m <message>] [-e] [-rR] [-s <url>] [-S <url>] [-u\n                <dir>] [-x <dir>] [-X <dir>]\n -e,--exitcode                 Return an exit code instead of printing\n                               error message on assert fail.\n -m,--message <message>        Exception message to be used in place of\n                               the default error message\n -R,--not-root                 Asserts that we are NOT the root user\n -r,--root                     Asserts that we are the root user\n -S,--not-started <url>        Asserts that Solr is NOT running on a\n                               certain URL. Default timeout is 1000ms\n -s,--started <url>            Asserts that Solr is running on a certain\n                               URL. Default timeout is 1000ms\n -t,--ms <ms>                  Timeout in ms for commands supporting a\n                               timeout\n -u,--same-user <directory>    Asserts that we run as same user that owns\n                               <directory>\n -verbose                      Generate verbose log messages\n -x,--exists <directory>       Asserts that directory <directory> exists\n -X,--not-exists <directory>   Asserts that directory <directory> does NOT\n                               exist\n\n\n\nThis can then also be used from bin/solr through e.g. run_tool assert -r, or from Java Code static methods such as AssertTool.assertSolrRunning(String url)",

Next step could be to replace some not-root-user or directory-exists checks.\n\nCurrently each assertion throws an exception which by the tool-runner is printed as ERRROR: <msg>. Could be that we want those error messages configurable when using the asserts from Java code. Perhaps also allow a cmdline switch -m <failure message> ",

Should we perhaps add support for any command to return an exit code? ",
