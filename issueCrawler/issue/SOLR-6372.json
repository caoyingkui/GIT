    "description": "When setting the UserGroupInformation's Configuration, HdfsDirectorFactory creates a new Configuration, see here:\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/44f0dd7599901ba4d3625b5da8b998858e198d67/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/core/HdfsDirectoryFactory.java#L306\n\nThe issue with this is when it's used to set the UserGroupInformation configuration, it can overwrite any existing configuration, which may have other (server) settings like kerberos rules. Ideally there would be separate client/servers interfaces so this wouldn't be an issue.  But lacking that, using the passed in Configuration allows the user to always specify all necessary settings.",

Unfortunately, we don't have any tests currently that use kerberos-based HDFS, so I tested this manually on a cluster I have.  I'll file a JIRA for adding those tests, I think it should be possible using Hadoop's MiniKDC. "
