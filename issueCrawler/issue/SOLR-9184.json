    "description": "Add a static convenience method ModifiableSolrParams#of(SolrParams) which returns the same instance if it already is modifiable, otherwise creates a new ModifiableSolrParams\u00a0instance.\n\nRationale: when writing custom SearchComponents, we find that we often need to ensure that the SolrParams are modifiable. The copy constructor of ModifiableSolrParams always creates a copy, even if the SolrParms already are modifiable.\n\nAlternatives: The method could also be added as a convenience method in SolrParams itself, which already has static helper methods for wrapDefaults and wrapAppended.",

            "content": "There's no need to remove previous patches.  Jira automatically handles marking the old ones differently than the newest one with the same filename.  Having previous versions of a patch available helps to understand the thought processes of the person who created the patches \u2013 we prefer to keep that history, even if the older patches are blatantly wrong.\n\nAlthough I like this change, it probably should be restricted to master (7.0-SNAPSHOT) because it could break existing code.  There are likely people who intentionally use the constructor to copy one MSP object, creating a new one that can be modified independently of the original.  If we change that behavior in a minor release, any user who depends on that behavior will have a broken program after upgrading SolrJ.  There might even be instances in the Solr main or test code that rely on this behavior \u2013 all uses must be reviewed.\n\nEdit: Closer reading reveals that you want to add a method.  Which makes my concern moot. ",

I accidentally left a println added for debugging in the first version and removed it.\n\nThis change simply adds a static factory method, it does not propose to modify the existing constructor. I agree that intentional use of the copy constructor is a valid use case that must be supported. ",
