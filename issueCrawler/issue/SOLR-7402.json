We should have a default or a basic out of the box implementation that solves the following:\n1. Gives something OTB for end-users that can be used.\n2. Provide a reference point on how to write a plugin.\n\nCurrently, this is a part of the patch on SOLR-7275. I'm splitting it into its own issue.",
