This was made private in this patch:\n\n-  // TODO: why is this public?\n-  public SegmentReader(SegmentCommitInfo si, int createdVersionMajor, IOContext context) throws IOException {\n-    this.si = si;\n+  SegmentReader(SegmentCommitInfo si, int createdVersionMajor, IOContext context) throws IOException {\n\n\n\nI agree it's expert-level API, but it is useful (has no alternative) for manipulating parallel indexes (see TestDemoParallelLeafReader). I am actually using this stuff (outside of Lucene code) exactly like Mike's \"demo\" shows \u2013 to maintain derived indexes from primary segments.\n\nCan we make this a primary API citizen (or expose a public interface implemented by this class that would convey the information required for TestDemoParallelLeafReader to work, if it's moved from .index package)?

I did look and I wonder why you can't just open the index you need from a directory and then steal the SegmentReader from it's leaves? I can totally back this part out and open another issue to discuss it, just asking to understand why there is no alternative? ",
