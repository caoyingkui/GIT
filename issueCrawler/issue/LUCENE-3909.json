    "description": "Lucene/Solr 3.6 and 4.0 will get out-of-the-box Japanese language support through KuromojiAnalyzer, KuromojiTokenizer and various other filters.  These filters currently live in org.apache.lucene.analysis.kuromoji.\n\nI'm proposing that we move Kuromoji to a new Japanese package org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja in line with how other languages are organized.  As part of this, I also think we should rename KuromojiAnalyzer to JapaneseAnalyzer, etc. to further align naming to our conventions by making it very clear that these analyzers are for Japanese.  (As much as I like the name \"Kuromoji\", I think \"Japanese\" is more fitting.)\n\nA potential issue I see with this that I'd like to raise and get feedback on, is that end-users in Japan and elsewhere who use lucene-gosen could have issues after an upgrade since lucene-gosen is in fact releasing its analyzers under the org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja namespace (and we'd have a name clash).\n\nI believe users should have the freedom to choose whichever Japanese analyzer, filter, etc. they'd like to use, and I don't want to propose a name change that just creates unnecessary problems for users, but I think the naming proposed above is most fitting for a Lucene/Solr release.",
