Instead of the names of the collections chosen from the list, the alias is created as \"object Object\". \n\nIf I create, for instance, an alias \"test\" and choose one collection from the list shown in the UI, the alias shows in the clusterstatus (i.e. http://host:port/solr/admin/collections?action=CLUSTERSTATUS) as \n\n\"aliases\":\n{\"test\":\"[object Object]\"}",
