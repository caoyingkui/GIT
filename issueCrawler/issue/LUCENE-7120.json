    "description": "The checksum verification only works when BKDWriter fully reads one of its temp files, but today it opens a reader, seeks to one slice, reads that, and closes.\n\nBut it turns out, on the full recursion from any given node in the tree, a given file is read once, fully, so if we just share the readers, then we can get checksum verification for these files as well.\n\nThis is a non-trivial change ... I don't plan on pushing it for 6.0.",
