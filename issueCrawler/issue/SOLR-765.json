I could have sworn i posted a comment about this before resolving but clearly i forgot to hit submit or something...\n\nThe purpose cleaning out the work directory is to provide a safety check to ensure that an older copy of the webapp (with old jars) isn't left lying around where Jetty might pick it up and use it by mistake \u2013 it's not suppose to happen but it can.  If we use failonerror=\"false\" it won't just silently ignore a missing work directly, it will also silently ignore any situation where files in the work directory can't be deleted by ant (because of the way the perms are set, or because windows prevents open files from being deleted, etc..) which means the whole point (the safety check) is gone \u2013  people will unwittingly be using old jars and banging their heads against their keyboards not knowing why "
