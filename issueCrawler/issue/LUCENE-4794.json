    "description": "In the process of implementing algorithms on the SpatialPrefixTree indexed field like \"Within\" or some variations of Intersects that say collect the distance as side-effect, I find that I need near-copies of the code in RecursivePrefixTreeFilter.  RPTF is pretty intense with lots of optimizations.  So I refactored out the algorithm such that it makes implementing new algorithms much easier yet benefits from the logic in there.\n\nPatch to follow...",

            "content": "Patch summary:\n\n\tIntersectsPrefixTreeFilter: replaces RecursivePrefixTreeFilter but has little code since most logic is in its superclass now.\n\tAbstractVisitingPrefixTreeFilter: Most of the former logic is here, with extensibility hooks.\n\t\n\t\tA new optimization that skips calls to seek() when the cell is known to precede the next term.\n\t\tThe former stack / LinkedList is now a tree structure using inner class \"VNode\".  Not really leveraged yet.\n\t\n\t\n\tAbstractPrefixTreeFilter: The superclass of AbstractVisitingPrefixTreeFilter \u2013 doesn't do much but hold essential state & implement equals & hashCode. Arguably isn't needed as separate but is useful for a Contains algorithm (not present, will follow in a few weeks) that doesn't use  AbstractVisitingPrefixTreeFilter.\n\ttree/Node.java: decoupled shapeRel & isLeaf into separate fields instead of isLeaf being true IFF shapeRel==WITHIN.  This is a small thing unrelated to the rest.\n\n\n\nThe tests pass.  I'll commit in a few days if there is no feedback. ",
