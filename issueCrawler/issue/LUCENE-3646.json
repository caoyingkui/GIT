    "description": "In Lucene 4.0, we go through a lot of effort to prevent slow uses of non-atomic readers:\n\nDirectoryReader/MultiReader etc throw exception if you don't try to access postings or docvalues apis per-segment, etc.\n\nBut the biggest trap of all is still too easy to fall into, we don't do the same for FieldCache.\n\nI think we should throw exception, forcing the user to either change their code or use a SlowMultiReaderWrapper.",
