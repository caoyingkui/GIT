    "description": "I have an RPT field which contains a mix of points and polygons.\n\nWhen I perform a geodist query, where the query point is within an indexed polygon, the polygon is correctly returned, however it is sorted as being the most distant, and the returned distance to the polygon exceeds the maximum distance specified in the query.\n\nObviously some calculation is being performed which puts the polygon within 100m of the query point, however the distance being calculated for sorting or/and response is not the same. It appears from playing with the query that if the Polygon is within the query distance then it is always returned as the last document, whether or not the documents are sorted.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the query and the final two documents returned...\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/Naptan/select?q=*:*&fl=*,dist:geodist()&rows=100&fq=\\{!geofilt}&sfield=location&pt=53.3805565,-1.4645408&d=0.1&sort=geodist()%20asc\n\n...\n\n\n\n35\n\u00a0\n\n\nATCOCode\n\"370022835\"\n\n\nStopType\n\"BCT\"\n\n\nStopCategory\n\"Bus\"\n\n\nlocation\n\u00a0\n\n\n0\n\"53.3813701862,-1.4650627934\"\n\n\nversion\n1614979438316880000\n\n\ndist\n0.096849374\n\n\n36\n\u00a0\n\n\nATCOCode\n\"502432214\"\n\n\nStopType\n\"BCS\"\n\n\nStopCategory\n\"Bus\"\n\n\nlocation\n\u00a0\n\n\n0\n\"POLYGON ((-1.4646256 53.3796518, -1.4635259 53.3796806, -1.4636171 53.3805894, -1.4627105 53.3810406, -1.4647973 53.3811781, -1.4646256 53.3796518))\"\n\n\nversion\n1615121382652248000\n\n\ndist\n20015.115",
