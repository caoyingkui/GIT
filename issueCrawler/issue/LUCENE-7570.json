    "description": "When an IndexWriter#commit() is stalled due to too many pending merges, you can get a deadlock if the currently active merge thread hits a tragic event.\n\n\n\tThe thread performing the commit synchronizes on the the commitLock in commitInternal.\n\tThe thread goes on to to call ConcurrentMergeScheduler#doStall() which waits() on the ConcurrentMergeScheduler object. This release the merge scheduler's monitor lock, but not the commitLock in IndexWriter.\n\tSometime after this wait begins, the merge thread gets a tragic exception can calls IndexWriter#tragicEvent() which in turn calls IndexWriter#rollbackInternal().\n\tThe IndexWriter#rollbackInternal() synchronizes on the commitLock which is still held by the committing thread from (1) above which is waiting on the merge(s) to complete. Hence, deadlock.\n\n\n\nWe hit this bug with Lucene 5.5, but I looked at the code in the master branch and it looks like the deadlock still exists there as well.",
