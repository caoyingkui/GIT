(for that matter: does anyone remember why we didn't deprecate StandardRequestHandler?  .. I actually thought we had.)\n\nComment: we should probably move the \"spellcheck\" <component> declaration (and thus the \"/spellCheckCompRH\" <requestHandler>) to after the explanation of what components are.
