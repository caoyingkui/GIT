            "content": "Hey Michael, I was thinking about how to nicely replace TermFreqIterator.\n\n\tI was thinking about having some kind of wrapper for TermFreqPayloadIterator that will nullify the payload field for the current TermFreqIterator consumers and a way for the wrapper to signal early on to the consumers that they dont need to deal with the payload at all.\n\tAlso It seems like there are a lot of implementations for TermFreqIterator (e.g BufferedTermFreqIteratorWrapper, SortedTermFreqIteratorWrapper); I will make sure all these implementation work with TermFreqPayloadIterator and its new wrapper (for mimicking TermFreqIterator).\n\n\n\nAny thoughts? I will try to come up with a rough patch soon. ",

I like the hasPayloads() up-front\nintrospection.\n\nIn UnsortedTermFreqIteratorWrapper.payload(), why do we set currentOrd\nas a side effect?  Shouldn't next() already do that?  Maybe, we should\ninstead assert currentOrd == ords[curPos]?  Also, can we break that\nsneaky currentOrd assignment in next into its own line before? ",
