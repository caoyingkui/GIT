    "description": "I didn't look too closely, but MergeScheduler has this piece of documentation:\n\n *  <p>Implementers of sub-classes should make sure that {@link #clone()}\n *  returns an independent instance able to work with any {@link IndexWriter}\n *  instance.</p>\n\n\n\nNow, we don't seem to be using this at all... I think. MergeScheduler doesn't even implement Cloneable. But in any case, I think it'd be better to provide an abstract covariant of this sort:\n\n\npublic abstract MergeScheduler clone() {\n  return this;\n}",
