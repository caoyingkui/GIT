    "description": "Database servers can return multiple result sets from a single statement. This can be beneficial for indexing because it reduces the number of connections and statements being executed against a database, therefore reducing overhead. The JDBC Statement object supports reading multiple ResultSets. Support should be added to the JdbcDataSource to take advantage of this.",

            "content": "I don't understand why this patch have not been applied. It is very small and uncomplicated. It's a good idea to read multiple resultset from a single statement.\n\nBut in my case, i would like set SQL session parameters before executing the query. \n\nFor example with a Postgresql example : \n\nSET join_collapse_limit=1;\nSELECT * FROM library.book b\nLEFT JOIN library.page p ON p.id_book=b.id_book;\n\n\nIn this example, the first resultset is empty but with the patch, the second resultset would be read.
