To my surprise, the core was created and the invalid options ignored:\n\n\n$ ./bin/solr create -c cloud -s 3 -rf 5\nWARNING: Using _default configset. Data driven schema functionality is enabled by default, which is\n         NOT RECOMMENDED for production use.\n\n         To turn it off:\n            curl http://localhost:8983/solr/cloud/config -d '{\"set-user-property\": {\"update.autoCreateFields\":\"false\"}}'\n\nCreated new core 'cloud'\n\n\n\nIf I used the more specific \"create_core\" option, the same thing happened. We should instead provide an error message to tell the user that they are trying to do something that's not possible or not going to happen the way they think it will.",
