    "description": "The following constructor of SolrIndexSearcher doesn't use 'config'.\n\nSolrIndexSearcher\npublic SolrIndexSearcher(SolrCore core, String path, IndexSchema schema, SolrIndexConfig config, String name, DirectoryReader r, boolean closeReader, boolean enableCache, boolean reserveDirectory, DirectoryFactory directoryFactory)\n\n\n\nIt doesn't make sense to pass in the SolrIndexConfig when we're passing in the DirectoryReader (and asserting that it's never null). Prior to LUCENE-5666, when 'r' was null, the config was used to get a reader but not any more.\n\nI'll just remove the param from the constructor and remove it from all places that calls this version of the constructor.",
