In general we should use the target type instead of the source type and sources need to implement getBytes and do auto conversion otherwise type promotion doesn't work.\n\nthis patch writes individual files per field like sep codec which made things a lot easier and is maybe better suited for SimpleText\n\ncomments welcome ",
