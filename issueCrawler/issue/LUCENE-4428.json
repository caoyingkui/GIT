    "description": "It would be nice if the smokeTester could verify the metadata inside the jars/wars we release, things like the following in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF:\n\n\n\tImplementation-Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation\n\tX-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.6 <-- check they used a 1.6 actual compiler\n\tX-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.6 <-- check that classes are the right format\n\tSpecification-Version: 4.0.0 <-- should match release version\n\n\n\nThere should also exist META-INF/LICENSE.txt and META-INF/NOTICE.txt and they should be correct (e.g. the solr one should not have lucene's or whatever).\n\nI think we could use some code similar to what Mike did on SOLR-3879 to do this. The only difference is that inside the solr.war, we are only interested in lucene-xxx and apache-solr-xxx jar files (not third party ones).",
