    "description": "This is flat dangerous with it's current implementation and should not get into the wild. The (I hope) proper fix is in SOLR-6691. I want to let that code bake for a while post 5.0 before committing though. So this will just comment the handling of REBALANCELEADERS from the collections API for the time being.\n\nMarked as \"blocker\", but I should be able to take care of this ASAP so it shouldn't stand in the way of 5.0.",
