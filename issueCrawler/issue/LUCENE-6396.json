    "description": "TermAutomatonQuery currently acts like a disjunction of its terms, and then in countMatches() it reads positions to find a match.\n\nIdeally it would act more like a conjunction, that only starts reading positions when its possible to reach an accept state via the set of PostingsEnums positioned on the current document.\n\nIf the query is (a|b) (c|d) then it shouldnt even read positions if only 'a' or 'a and b' are positioned at the current document, for example. it should move on.\n\nIt would also be great to support two-phase iteration here.",
