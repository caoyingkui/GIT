            "content": "Well (optionally, and sometimes) replacing the default filesystem provider is only one of many things going on here. its also still setting up cleanupQueue and all that stuff for all these to be closed when the test class ends, removing files from those temp dirs, failing if it can't do this, etc, etc so it still manages the cleanup. In general I think its good to just have our temporary file handling (whatever that is doing) consolidated here. "
