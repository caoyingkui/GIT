This will cause many problems, one of the\u00a0problems can happen (the patch including a test which lead to this failure) is\n\nA replica with DOWN state can become a leader\u00a0and the shard will be stuck in this state forever until the replica is removed or the node contains the replica is restarted.\n\nThis won't be a problem in Solr 7.2.1 because a replica with last published state = DOWN can't become a leader, only since\u00a0SOLR-7034\u00a0get resolved (by SOLR-12011)",
