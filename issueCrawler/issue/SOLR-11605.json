    "description": "ShingleFilterFactory should have an option to ignore filler tokens in the total shingle size. \nFor instance (adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33193144/solr-stemming-stop-words-and-shingles-not-giving-expected-outputs), consider the text \"A brown fox quickly jumps over the lazy dog\". When we remove stopwords and execute the ShingleFilter (shingle size = 3), it gives us the following result:\n\n1. _ brown fox\n2. brown fox quickly\n3. fox quickly jump\n4. quickly jump _\n5. jump _ _\n6. _ _ lazy\n7. _ lazy dog\n\nWe can clearly see that the filler token \"_\" occupies one token in the shingle.\nI suppose the returned shingles should be:\n1. brown fox quickly\n2. fox quickly jump\n3. quickly jump lazy\n4. jump lazy dog\n\nTo maintain backward compatibility, i suggest the creation of an option called \"skipFillerTokens\" to implement this behavior (note that this is different than using fillerTokens=\"\", since the empty string occupies one token in the shingle)\n\nI will attach a patch for the ShingleFilter class (getNextToken() method).",
