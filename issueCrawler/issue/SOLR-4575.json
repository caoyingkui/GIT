Lots of very important implicit properties won't work without this, basically all of the solr.core.[instanceDir|dataDir|configName|schemaName|name]\n\nThis was built on trunk, but should apply to 4x cleanly (although I haven't tried it).\n\nI'll commit to trunk and merge these into 4x after I've run all the tests, probably not until the morning though, I'd like to look it over again after some sleep.\n\nThanks for pointing this out Shawn! I'm really glad this didn't get into a release..... "

I don't think many others have had a chance to check it out or comment on it yet - I know I have not. Before we get some back compat pains out there, we should really get more people looking at these changes and make sure it's what we really want to move to. I think a key reason not many people have looked at this yet is that the example is not setup for it - I really think if we are going to support it, we need to move the example and tests to it and force people/devs to see it.

            "content": "Mark:\n\nActually, I had it completely backwards. Restoring this behavior doesn't require that you define, for instance, \"solr.core.name\" in core.properties, you should still just use \"name\". These are the \"implicit properties\" that you can refer to in, for instance, solrconfig.xml.\n\nThe only real back-compat cost at this point is carrying around two entries for each of the listed properties in coredescriptor, e.g.\n\nname => collection1\nand\nsolr.core.name => collection1\n\nIn fact, in this example in solrconfig.xml, you could ask for\n<infoStream file=\"INFOSTREAM-${solr.core.name}.txt\">false</infoStream>\nor\n<infoStream file=\"INFOSTREAM-${name}.txt\">false</infoStream> \nand get the same results.\n\nSo with that cost I think we should put this behavior back rather than pull the rug out from under existing behavior. If we want to yank it for 5.0 all we have to do is remove CoreContainer.initImplicitProperties.  "
