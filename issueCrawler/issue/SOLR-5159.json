I want to verify Maven2 locally, and I also want to compare all manifest entries with the Ant-produced ones - the solr entries were changed recently, and I want to keep them in sync.  Once these issues are settled, I'll commit. "

            "content": "I want to verify Maven2 locally, and I also want to compare all manifest entries with the Ant-produced ones - the solr entries were changed recently, and I want to keep them in sync.\n\nMaven 2.2.1 works fine.\n\nI compared the Ant-built and Maven-built manifests, and the Maven-built ones of course have lots of Bnd-produced entries not in the Ant-built ones.  There are two other differences:\n\n\n\tThe Maven-built manifest contains Implementation-Vendor-Id (with Maven coordinate groupId as the value: org.apache.lucene or org.apache.solr).  I think this is fine to leave in, and maybe the Ant-built manifests should get it too?\n\tThe Maven-built manifests have the old style Specification-Version, including a timestamp, e.g. 5.0.0.2013.08.16.12.36.14, where the Ant-built manifests just have the version, e.g. 5.0-SNAPSHOT.  The latter is actually syntactically incorrect, since the value should only have digits and period.  I've left it as the old style in the Maven version, since it's not a syntax error, and since the Maven versions will only ever be produced by end-users - all snapshot and release Maven artifacts are produced by Ant.\n\n\n\nI've committed to trunk and branch_4x.\n\nThanks Artem!
