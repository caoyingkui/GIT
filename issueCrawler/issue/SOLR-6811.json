    "description": "got a stall today in TestLBHttpSolrServer.testSimple on 5x branch\n\nlooking at the stack dumps, it seems like there are 2 instances of CloserThread wait()ing to be notified on the same \"lock\" Object?\n\n2 things seem suspicious:\n\na) what are they waiting for? what thread is expected to be notifying? (because i don't see anything else running that might do the job)\nb) why are there 2 instances of CloserThread?  from a quick skim it seems like there should only be one.",
