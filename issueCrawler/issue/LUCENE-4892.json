    "description": "There are lots of use-cases where the number of deleted documents is low. This makes live docs very dense and I think it would be interesting to study the impact of some bitmap compression techniques on performance (intuitively I imagine it will be slower, but since it would make data smaller maybe CPU caches could help us so I'd be curious to see how it would behave). This format would make a good addition to our CheapBastardCodec.",

            "content": "I have a proof of concept (see patch) that passes the tests and uses a hash set of integers in the sparse case (until around 3% of deletions) and a bitset afterward. The hash set tries to leverage the fact that it stores dense integers by using the index in the hash table as a source of information to reconstruct the original value, so it can store data in a short[] rather than an int[]. It allows the hash set to use around 6 bytes per value in spite of enforcing a load factor of at most 50%.\n\nI still need to do more testing but wanted to upload a preview of this patch in case someone has feedback on the approach.
