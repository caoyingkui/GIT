    "description": "Several class variables (baseURL, allowCompression, maxRetries, etc) have neither getters nor setters. By creating getters and setters for these properties, we can allow other developers to extend CommonsHttpSolrServer with additional functionality. It is also then necessary to use these methods internally, as opposed to referencing the class variables directly.\n\n\n\nFor example, by extending a method like \npublic String getBaseURL()\nOne could attach a host monitoring or home-brewed DNS resolution service to intercept, thus replicating the functionality of LBHttpSolrServer with very little of the code.\n\nAttached is a basic patch (generated using eclipse Source tools), as a minimal set of changes. I have not changes the general coding style of the file, though that would be preferable. I am open to suggestion on whether these methods should be public (as in the attached patch), or protected.",
