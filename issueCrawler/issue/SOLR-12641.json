    "description": "Right now, Http2SolrClient can't connect to old Solr nodes, this seems an issue of Jetty HTTP client (https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/1308). To support rolling updates, this problem must be solved.\n\nAfter discussing with other guys, we agree that rolling updates can be no support in Solr 8.0 with default settings since it is a major release. Users who want to do rolling updates must follow these two steps.\n\n\tUpgrade nodes will start with a special flag to indicate that they will use HTTP/1.1 as the protocol for intercommunication.\n\tWhen all nodes are in version 8.0, restart nodes and remove above special flag, therefore nodes will communicate with others using HTTP/2 from thereafter.\n\n\n\nThis issue will aim to introduce that special flag. Note that by default HTTP/2 still the default protocol for Solr 8.0.",

An instance of HttpClient is created with a specific transport and currently cannot switch to another transport.\n\nYou can partially workaround this by having two HttpClient instances, one with the HTTP/1.1 transport and one with the HTTP/2 transport, but you have to try one, if it fails try the other, it's clunky.\nSeems like currently the only way is to try and use the HTTP2 client, and fail over to the HTTP1.1 client, until issue #1350 is resolved.

Whenever a new connection is created we will base on that flag to create proper HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 connection. This can a little bit tricky and needs more tests to make sure everything works correctly.\n\nWhat do you guys think Shawn Heisey, Steve Rowe, Shalin Shekhar Mangar ",
