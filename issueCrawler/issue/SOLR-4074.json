I guess part of it was thinking that Solr is a search server and so it was more important that it default to 100 here. Lucene being a lib, it's was slightly more plausible that lucene could stick with 32 - I didn't remember the reasons it was first set to that.\n\nI'm +1 on changing in Lucene as well though. I think it it will benefit way more people that it will harm (whom can just lower it). I'll create an issue. "

I bet 8/10 new users get better performance from Lucene and .1/10 would find they have to lower it. Probably a sim number as those that already have to lower - I'm not sure there is anything special about 32 if your already fighting for every megabyte. "
