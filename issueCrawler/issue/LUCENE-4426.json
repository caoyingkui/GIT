Maybe the new classes of my patch could replace this one:\n\n\tthe objectVal method returns an object whose type matches the ValueSource name,\n\tthere is the StrDocValuesFieldSource to deal with DocValues.Type.BYTES* when they are UTF8-encoded Strings\n\tthey use a default source when the segment has no DocValues\n\tthey give the ability to load direct sources\n\n\n\n(My goal is to reuse them in SOLR-3855)\n\nI am confused why the current one only handles 3 types?\n\nRight. Strange that it is able to deal with VAR_INTS but none of FIXED_INTS_*. ",
