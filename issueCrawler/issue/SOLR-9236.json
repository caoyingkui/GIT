    "description": "I need to index huge amount of logs, so I decide to use AutoAddReplica feature with only one replica.\nWhen using AutoAddReplicas with one replica, some benefits are expected.\n\n\tno redundant data files for replicas\n\t\n\t\tsaving disk usage\n\t\n\t\n\tbest indexing performance\n\n\n\nI expected that Solr fails over just like HBase.\nThe feature worked almost as it was expected, except for some missing documents during failover.\nI found two reasons for the missing.\n\n1. The leader replica does not replay any transaction logs. But when there is only one replica, it should be the leader.\nSo I made the leader replica replay the transaction logs when using AutoAddReplicas with on replica.\n\nBut the above fix did not resolve the problem.\n\n2. As failover occurred, the transaction log directory had a deeper directory depth. Just like this, tlog/tlog/tlog/...\nThe transaction log could not be replayed, because the transaction log directory was changed during failover. \nSo I made the transaction log directory not changed during failover.\n\nAfter these fixes, AutoAddReplicas with one replica fails over well without losing any documents.",
