From your original confusion I took the fact that that wasn't clear.\n\nPlease do an SVN up, and redo 'ant server' - you'll see I've added a warning message on the new UI (as a part of SOLR-7858). Let me know what you think - is it clearer now? Other suggestions as to how to make it clear that the \"New UI\" words are a link not a title? ",

            "content": "The new message on the new UI is definitely much better.\n\nFor the link on the old UI, how about something like this: \n\n\"Try the New UI\"\n\"Switch to the New UI\"\n\"Go to the New UI\"\n\"Feeling bold? Check out the new UI here\"\n\nAnything with a verb (call to action) would indicate that this is a link instead of a title, so that would be a fist step towards making it clearer.\n\nI want to suggest some CSS/UI improvements like adding an underline or something to it to make it look like a link, but there is nothing else on that page that would give a visual queue to the user that an underline means link because there aren't any like that on the page.\nThe only similar links are in the footer (documentation,  issue tracker, etc). So maybe adding an icon (eg. right arrow ->) next to it and making it the same style (on hover) like the footer links.\n ",
