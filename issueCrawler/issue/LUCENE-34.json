See line 106: \n\n<EMAIL: <ALPHANUM> \"@\" <ALPHANUM> (\".\" <ALPHANUM>)+ > \n\nFor example, neither danson@germane-software.com (because of the dash) nor \ndale.anson@germane-software.com (because of the first dot and the dash) match. \nthe following is slightly better, but does not come close to meeting the \nspecifications of RFC 822: \n\n<EMAIL: <ALPHANUM> (\".\"|\"\" <ALPHANUM>)+ \"@\" <ALPHANUM> (\".\"|\"\" <ALPHANUM>)+ \n> \n\nThis is being reported against the May 11 nightly build (I compiled from \nsource using the supplied Ant build file on RedHat Linux 7.2, jikes, javacc \n2.0, and Sun Linux JDK 1.4), however, I originally ran across this problem in \nLucene 1.2 rc4.",
