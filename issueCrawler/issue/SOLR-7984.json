    "description": "As noted on the user list by Scott Hollenbeck the following warning can be logged by solr...\n\nno default request handler is registered (either '/select' or 'standard')\n\n...even if there is both a handler named \"standard\" and a handler (in his case named \"pinkPony\") defined as default=\"true\".\n\nThe code in question appears to be total nonsense...\n\n\n    if(!handlers.alias( \"/select\",\"\")){\n      if(!handlers.alias( \"standard\",\"\")){\n        log.warn(\"no default request handler is registered (either '/select' or 'standard')\");\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\tPluginBag.alias is not documented, but appears to be a mutating operation that adds an alias if and only if the first arg is aname of something that exists, and the second arg is a name that does not already exist \u2013 returning true if the alias is added\n\tif an alias already exists with the (default) name \"\" (which initHandlersFromConfig takes care of registring before this code) then neither of these can be made the new default.\n\tjust because neither of these aren't made the default here, doesn't mean there isn't already a default handler \u2013 it actually means the exact oposite\n\tif the goal was to log an error when there is no default, then that should have just been checked directly",
