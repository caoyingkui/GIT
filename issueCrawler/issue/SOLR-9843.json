There's nothing here that couldn't be in production so I'll check it in to both trunk and 6x so it'll (I hope) hit the failure mode faster.\n\nOne failure is \"impossible\". The test indexes 4 docs, commits and then does a : query which only finds three docs. The message is \"Should have exactly 4 documents returned expected:<4> but was:<3>\". (line 263 called from line 244 after the patch is applied). The process is\n1> in @Before, DBQ on : and commit\n2> add some docs\n3> test.\n\nNow the document IDs are re-used so I'm wondering if it's vaguely possible that we're somehow (tm) DBQ is partly at issue? Hmmm, I'll write a stressor for that one just for yucks.\n\nI did incorporate David's suggestions, and there was one initialization issue that I dont't think matters that I changed. None of those changes seems like it even could be related to the \"impossible\" test failure above, which just means I must be missing something. ",

            "content": "Attaching triage of the output from Jenkins. The difficult bit is that shard3_replica 1 apparently gets 2 docs added (2,3) but then only returns 1 if them (id=2). From what I see, the sequence of events is fine.\n\n\n\tfail.txt is the snippet around this test from the failure on Jenkins (Windows 32 bit). I think I've seen Jenkins failures on OS X, but don't have the record now.\n\tshard3_replica1.txt is all the mentions of shard3_replica1 from fail.txt\n\tshard_3_searchers.txt shows all of the searchers opening from shard3_replica1.txt.\n\n\n\nHere's the sequence in the test:\n\n\tthe DBQ of : happens in @Before\n\tcommit happens in @Before\n\tthe update for docs 2 and 3 going to shard3_replica1 happens\n\tcommit happens\n\ta new searcher is opened\n\ta : query goes to shard3_replica1\n\tshard3_replica1 only returns doc 2 (ids=2).\n\n\n\nI looked at successful tests and the \"expected\" thing happens, i.e. shard3_replica1 : returns ids=2,3\n\nSo this looks like something that's not just an artifact of this test, nor something reproducible with the seeds. Maybe something fundamental to Solr, maybe something in the test framework. Maybe a race condition. Maybe I'm hallucinating.\n\nI'm starting to think this test exposes some race condition that's been lurking in the code for a while. There's a user's list question about not returning docs that may be relevant too, the title is \"empty result set for a sort query\" from moscovig that Yonik Seeley responded to. ",
