The core auto discovery mechanism trying to find core.properties. \nBut I found the core.properties cannot be create when I dynamically create a collection.\nThe root issue is the CorePropertiesLocator trying to create properties before the instanceDir is created. \nAnd collection creation process will done and looks fine at runtime, but it will cause issues (cores are not auto discovered after server restart).",
