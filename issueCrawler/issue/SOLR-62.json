    "description": "Solr scripts that post commands to solr don't check the return code.\n\nThe scripts (like optimize) currently follow this pattern:\n\nrs=`curl http://localhost:5051/update -s -d \"<optimize/>\"`\nif [[ $? != 0 ]]\nthen\n  [...]\nfi\n\n\n\tcheck status of optimize request\nrc=`echo $rs|cut -f2 -d'\"'`\nif [[ $? != 0 ]]\nthen\n  [...]\n\n\n\n$rc is never checked.  In addition, the line that grabs rc appears pretty\nfragile by depending on an exact field column.  Unless we have a simple command\nline XML parser, how about checking for the return code this way:\n\necho $rs | grep '<response.*status=\"0\"' > /dev/null 2>&1\nif [[ $? != 0 ]]\nthen\n  [...]",
