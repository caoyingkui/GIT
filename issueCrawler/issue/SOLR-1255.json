But I'm not personally knowledgeable enough about the ReplicationHandler to know the best way to proceed...\n\nQuestion: Is it concievable that someone could register multiple instances of the ReplicationHandler in a single core?\n\n\n\tIf the answer is \"No\" then there should probably be some tests/error messages related to it ... both in the replication admin JSP and probably in ReplicationHandler.init()\n\n\n\n\n\tIf the answer is \"Yes\" then the replication admin pages need to be more robust ... either giving the user an option to pick which handler instance to \"admin\" or allowing all of hte handlers to be monitored/admined on a single form.\n\n\n\nthe current behavior (picking one instance at random) seems like a very poor compromise.\n "
