    "description": "We no longer allow seeking in IndexOutput, so there is no need to use RandomAccessFile. We can change this with a < 1 KiB patch.\n\nFurther improvements would be to merge this with OutputStreamIndexOutput, so we get many simplifications.\n\nThere is also no reason anymore to separate DataOutput from IndexOutput. The only additional thing is IndexOutput#getFilePointer(), which is handled by  an internal counter (does not use getFilePointer of the underlying RAF) and checksums.",

This now makes BufferedIndexOutput obsolete (once I fixed RateLimiter, which buffers a second time!!! horrible!!!).\n\nBut before I do this, we should check the perf, because this is now completely different code.\n\nI also fixed HdfsDirectory to use this new class, too.\n\nThe only remaining use of BufferedIndexOutput is in RateLimiter. I think we should plug the rate limiter deeper on the OutputStream level in future (subclass BufferedOutputStream to limit rate) and allow to plug that into the FSDir impl. ",
