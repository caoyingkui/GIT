Therefore they are useful metrics to be included in telemetry. \n\nThe output data size is usually defined by user and not too large. Therefore the output data set size is not included.",

            "content": "Here is the patch. It adds two metrics to facet telemetry:\n1. inputDocSetSize: the size of input doc set for each sub-facet.\n2. numBuckets: number of unique buckets. It is the same number to the numBuckets in facet query result if numBuckets param is set to true in query. and is for field facet only. The reason to dup in facet telemetry is \n\n\tquery user may not turn on numBuckets but the operation and monitoring team still want to view numBucket information.\n\toperation and monitoring team may not be allowed to view query result.\n\n\n ",
