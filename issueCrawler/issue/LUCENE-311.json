    "description": "There are AND and DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND in QueryParser, so calling \nsetOperator(QueryParser.AND) looks okay and compiles, but it's not correct. \nI'll attach a patch that uses a typesafe enum to avoid this problem. As \nthere's also a getOperator method I had to change the name of the new method \nto get/setDefaultOperator. I don't like that, but it seems to be the only way \nto avoid compile errors for people who switch to a new version of Lucene. \n\nOkay to commit?",
