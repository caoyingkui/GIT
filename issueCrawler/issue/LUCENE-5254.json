    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-5248, where Shai discovered this ...\n\nSegmentCoreReaders has a SegmentReader owner member, that points to the\nfirst SegmentReader that was opened.  When that SR is reopened to SR2,\ne.g. because new deletes or NDV updates happened, the same SCR is\nshared.\n\nBut, even if you close SR1, any thing it points to cannot be GCd\nbecause SCR is pointing to it.\n\nI think the big things are liveDocs and the NDV update maps; Shai is\ngoing to fix the latter in LUCENE-5248, so this issue should fix\nliveDocs.\n\nThe simplest fix is to make liveDocs not final and null it out in\ndoClose ... but that's sort of fragile (what if we add other members\nin the future and forget to null them on close?).  I think it'd be better to\neliminate the owner reference; it's only used so we can evict\nFieldCache entry once the core is closed.  Maybe we can just store the\ncoreCacheKey instead?",
