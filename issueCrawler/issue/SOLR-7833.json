Since the layout has room for a fixed number of books (6), I removed the two oldest books: \"Solr 4 Cookbook\" and \"Taming Text\".\n\n\n\nRafa\u0142 Ku\u0107, do you want to keep the older editions of your book on the books page?  Either way is fine with me.  Note that they are still there now. ",
