The bad news is, I don't have a fix yet.\n\nI suspect the fails started happening because of the switch to using the nio jetty connector. I don't think it's acceptable that I have to avoid using that (plus it makes one test randomly take 3 minutes rather than 3 seconds if I don't use it), but I'm not sure how to get around this yet.\n\nIf the hurricane does not eat me up, I'll continue trying to overcome this.

I'll start by reverting I suppose and keep looking for a solution.\n\nAt worst we can pass a isFreebsd sys prop or something on our free bsd jenkings machine and then don't use NIO in that case. I'd rather it worked somehow though... "

Both are FreeBSD 9.\n\nNext just run one of the problem tests.\n\nI use SolrCmdDistributorTest, because it's also what prompted the switch. This test makes a bunch of connections very quickly. With the non NIO connector, it sometimes takes 2 seconds, sometimes 2 minutes. With the NIO connector it's always 2 seconds in my experience. However, on FreeBSD, you have the hangs after the test is over... "
