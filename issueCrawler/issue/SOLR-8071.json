    "description": "Note from Upayavira on SOLR-7666:\n\n\nI agree that the query tab is difficult in that it expects you to know what all these options mean. I'd love to see a new take on the query tab - a bit more akin to what /browse does - a more traditional query interface. But it'd take quite some thinking as to how to make it generic and work across all datasets.\n\nPlease do create a new ticket for this. I'm thinking about a \"query builder\" that allows you to pick from a list of fields to query, then type in terms you want to query from those fields, and it spits out a query string, much like the query UI currently spits out a URL.",

If the builder interface that is envisioned could have something similar with query parameters, it would be pretty nice. ",
