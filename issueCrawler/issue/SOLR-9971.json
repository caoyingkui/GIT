The use case behind this request is that it is useful to keep gc and console logs separate from the application logs because there are different archival / ingestion / processing requirements for each.\n\nI agree that it can be helpful to keep gc and application logs separate. SOLR-11233 concerns customisation of GC_LOG_OPTS i.e. there is some commonality with this issue here. ",
