    "description": "It appears that when indexing a document using CloudSolrClient that misses the \"id\" field, no indication, exception or warning is given at any point, and the document is indexed using a\u00a0regular load-balancing approach. This can be very detrimental in collections where the id field has a different name and the indexing client forgot to call the \"setIdField\" method, causing an indexing performance hit with no apparent explanation.\n\nThe documentation requires that the \"setIdField\" method be called in case the id field is named differently, and therefore the code should reflect this requirement in at least some way.\n\nI have only tested this on SolrJ 6.5.1, but from a brief look it appears that this behavior probably applies to SolrJ 7+.",
