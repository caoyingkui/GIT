This is not done, bacuse when anybody builds the release from a SVN checkout or a modified local src.tgz extraction, he will not produce the same artifacts. Because of that we only have the branch name in the default verson string.\n\nWhen a release is prepared, we explicitely set the version number using -Dversion=foobar.\n\nP.S.: This means, when somebody downloads Lucene-3.6.0-src.tgz and then calls ant package, he will get a -dev/-snapshot build unless he uses -Dversion.

But I don't think we should do that now (or people will get\nconfused about what version to terget things).\n\nThe only trick here for alpha/beta is the internal number LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION used\nby IndexWriter only internally must be bumped after alpha to 4.0.0.1 or something,\nso that we know which exact version of lucene wrote the segment. it must be a number\nso that various comparators etc work. but thats totally internal to indexwriter and \nno users see it.

But I don't think we should do that now (or people will get confused about what version to terget things).\n\nJust to be clear, i think this absolutely MUST be done, and would be total chaos otherwise.\n\nIf we are going to vote and have official \"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" releases that we want end users to actually try out and test thoroughly, then we are going to need a way to record when a bug was found/fixed in 4.0-Alpha vs the 4.0-Beta vs the 4.0-final.\n\nUntil we have a formally voted on Alpha it's not a big deal, but as soon as that moment happens, ever bug that currently says \"Fixed in: 4.0\" should be bulked edited to say \"Fixed in: 4.0-Alpha, 4.0\" \u2013 so that 9 months from now when someone says \"I'm still running 4.0-Alpha because there was an API change to fix a bug that made it too hard for me to upgrade to 4.0-Beta\" there is a good clean record of what bug fixes they do/don't have.\n\nNo. We are targeting 4.0, these are just snapshots of that!\n\nCalling the alpha/beta snapshots is extremely missleading and should be avoided.  The only usage of the term \"snapshot\" in apache (that i know of) are for unofficial nightly/jenkins/svn builds.  Since the alpha/beta releases will in fact be official (VOTEd) releases we should not ever imply/refer to them as \"snapshots\" since that would convey lower status on them (and reduce the likely hood of enn users testing them) then they will deserve.
