I'm working on the publicly available datasets.\n\nI have a question for that:\nWhat is the preferd way for the public test set. I could build a separated project, with example code snippets for training and evaluating (and maybe some measurement summary). Or I can make a project what is making the index, what can be plug into the Lucene tests. The second method have some cons like the test need fail if it classifying badly, and some question like; where I need to put the initial indexes (or source documents).\n\n(I started a separated project but of course it can be merged.)
