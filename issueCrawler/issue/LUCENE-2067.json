The only thing I do not see in the paper is \n\n if (len > 1 && s[len - 2] == 'e') {\n      s[len - 2] = s[len - 1]; // e* > *\n      return len - 1;\n }\n\n\n\ndurin the normalize stage. Maybe I miss something in the paper or this is some kind of optimisation. If so would you add a comment? - would make it easier!\nI also see no reason why the CzechStemFilter should be none final.\n ",

This is an e that appears (usually\nbefore the last consonant in the stem) when there is no ending after the stem, but is absent\nwhen there is a case ending. \nHere are some examples: \n\n\tpes 'dog' Nsg : psi 'dogs' Npl\n\totec 'father' Nsg : otce 'father' Gsg\n\tdeska 'board' Nsg : desek 'boards' Gpl.\n\n\n\nI also see no reason why the CzechStemFilter should be none final.\nI will make the stemfilter final, thanks!
