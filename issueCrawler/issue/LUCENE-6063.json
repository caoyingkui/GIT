    "description": "In LUCENE-5310 we explored improving CMS/SMS sharing/concurrency, but\nthe issue never \"converged\", so I want to break out one small part of\nit here: the ability to override CMS's default \"aggressive\"\ndenial-of-service protection where it forcefully stalls the incoming\nthreads that are responsible for creating too many segments.\n\nMore advanced applications can more gracefully handle the \"too many\nmerges\" by e.g. slowing down the incoming indexing rate at a higher\nlevel.",
