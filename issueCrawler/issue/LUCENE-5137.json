    "description": "There is a comment (best effort NPE if you dont call reset) in the \"getScannerFor\" method in UAX29URLEmailTokenizer. The callers of getScannerFor do NOT call reset, so an NPE is thrown in the parser which has a null Reader.  If you put the line \"this.scanner.yyreset(input);\" after each call to getScannerFor, the NPE is avoided.",
