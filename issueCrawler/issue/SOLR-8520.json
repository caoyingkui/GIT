            "content": "So the approach I used isn't great since it's just the length of the column name. Currently there is no way to know the length of a column and probably won't be since we don't have things like varchar types. We could do something like hardcode the length based on the type and document it. I don't know if it really matters to start. This will at least make the column width wide enough to display the title of the column. ",
