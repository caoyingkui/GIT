    "description": "When performing MoreLikeThis queries we have a lot of parameters at hand in order to finetune the results. However, one thing I personally missed, being able to set a minimum of matching terms.\n\nThe advantage of this parameter is that Lucene will retrieve only the documents which have at least the given number of matching terms and you won't get any results of just one or two keyword matches when you are looking for documents that have more than a few matching interesting keywords.\n\nAn example:\n\ndoc1: lucene\ndoc2: lucene release\ndoc3: apache\ndoc4: apache lucene\ndoc5: apache lucene release\n\nLet's say the query is \"apache lucene release\" and you set the minimum number of matching interesting terms to 2.\n\nMoreLikeThis will return:\ndoc2, doc4 and doc5\n\nWould you set it to 3, it would return just doc5.",
