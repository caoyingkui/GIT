    "description": "Now that IndexWriter allows committing changes even if the only change is setCommitData, DirectoryTaxonomyWriter creates empty commits because whenever you call commit/close, it sets as commitData the indexEpoch, thereby creating unnecessary commit points.\n\nI think that DirTaxoWriter should track if the index is dirty ... or preferably get that from IndexWriter (i.e. getChangeCount or something). I'll create a test case exposing the bug and then fix DTW.",
