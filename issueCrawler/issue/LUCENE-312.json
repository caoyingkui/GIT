    "description": "We have been using Lucene 3.1 version with Tomcat 4.0 and jdk1.4. \nIt seems that sometimes we see a \"Too many files open\" exception which \ncompletely garbles the whole index and whole search functionality crashes on \nthe web site. It has also been known to crash the complete JSP container of \ntomcat. \n\nAfter looking at the bug list, we found out that it has been reported as a bug \nin the Lucene bug list as Bug#29774, #30049, #30452 which claims to have been \nresolved with the new version of Lucene. \n\nWe have tried everything to reproduce the problem ourselves to figure out the \nexact circumstances under which it occurs but with out any luck.\n\n\nWe would be installing the new version of Lucene but we need to be able to \nreproduce the problem to test it.\n\nWe would really appreciate it if someone could point us to the root cause \nbehind this so we can devise a solution around that.",
