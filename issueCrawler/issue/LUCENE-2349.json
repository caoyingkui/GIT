    "description": "We cannot safely use parallel tests (LUCENE-1709) because some test classes try to use temporary directories with the same name.\nSo if these two happen to run at the same time, they conflict.\n\nFor example TestIndexReader has code like this:\n\nFile dirFile = new File(TEMP_DIR, \"testIndex\");\n\n\n\nBut TestCompoundFile has similar code:\n\nFile file = new File(TEMP_DIR, \"testIndex\");\n\n\n\nIf both these classes run at the same time, there will be problems.\n\nIf we want to use parallel tests safely, we have to fix this use of the static TEMP_DIR which does not include any unique name of the test.\nIdeally we can do this without changing a lot of test code, especially backwards.",
