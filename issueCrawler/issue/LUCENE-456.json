    "description": "If using a searcher that subclasses from IndexSearcher I get different result sets (besides the ordering of course). The problem only occurrs if the searcher is wrapped by (Parallel)MultiSearcher and the index is not too small. The number of hits returned by un unsorted and a sorted search are identical but the hits are referencing different documents. A closer look at the result sets revealed that the sorted search returns duplicate hits.\n\nI created test cases for Lucene 1.4.3 as well as for the head release. The problem showed up for both, the number of duplicates beeing bigger for the head realease. The test cases are written for package org.apache.lucene.search. There are messages describing the problem written to the console. In order to see all those hints the asserts are commented out. So dont't be confused if junit reports no errors. (Sorry, beeing a novice user of the bug tracker I don't see any means to attach the test cases on this screen. Let's see.)",

            "content": "This could be related to issue 453 I submitted a few days ago.\n\n(Parallel-)MultiSearcher uses a FieldDocSortedHitQueue to merge the results from the underlying IndexSearchers into the final result list (even if there's only one).\n\nThere's a bug if two documents are compared that don't have the field that is being compared.  If one document doesn't have the field, then it should come first, but if both don't have it, they should be considered equal and the next SortField tried.\n\nIn the current implementation (1.4.3 and head) when both fields are null, one of the two is always chosen as being 'lessThan' the other.  Since this is not consistent (the value of the lessThan depends of the order of the parameters in that case) it changes the sort order (as I observed) and can probably 'confuse' the queue implementation so you get dropped and double hits.\n\nCould you try to apply the patch I submitted for FieldDocSortedHitQueue and see if that helps in your case too?

            "content": "The patch doesn't fix the problem. On the contrary the number of reported duplicates increases. However, the fact that the patch changes the behaviour at all may imply that the problem does relate to the FieldSortedHitQueue.\nAs an additional test I removed the if statement in my testcase that causes field \"publicationDate_\" staying empty for some documents. (So that all documents have that field.) After the change there are still duplicates in the result set, however there are less. This implies that the problem has not directly to do with sorting of empty fields. ",
