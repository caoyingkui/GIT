            "content": "So the CME is easy to fix but more interesting is why is a CME happening. There is an assumption in the test that a listener added later through the API will be fired later. But no such guarantee is made by the autoscaling framework (even though I documented this guarantee in the ref guide!). So, if two listeners are listening for the SUCCEEDED event then they can be fired in any order, which causes the test to fail in this instance. ",
