    "description": "bin/solr -c will start Solr in cloud mode. Since collection1 includes a core.properties, it will be auto-discovered and created into a collection. So the script uses:\n\n-Dbootstrap_confdir=./solr/collection1/conf -Dcollection.configName=myconf\n\nHowever, it's not setting -DnumShards for collection1, which results in collection1 being created using the implicit router and a null range. While we have this collection1 being auto-deployed, the script should set numShards as well so that collection1 is created correctly.",
