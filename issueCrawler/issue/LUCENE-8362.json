    "description": "I'm opening this issue to discuss adding DocValue support to {Int|Long|Float|Double}Range field types. Since existing numeric range fields already provide the methods for encoding ranges as a byte array I think this could be as simple as adding syntactic sugar to existing range fields that simply build an instance of BinaryDocValues using that same encoding. I'm envisioning something like doc.add(IntRange.newDocValuesField(\"intDV\", 100) But I'd like to solicit other ideas or potential drawbacks to this approach.",
