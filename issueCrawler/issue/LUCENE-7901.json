            "content": "Thanks Jason Gerlowski!\n\nI enhanced it further to add null checks to the setters too.  Objects.requireNonNull is fine even if you don't get the custom message, IMO.  I did a bit more house-keeping of fixing some indentation and adjusting field order to match the constructor.  I moved package level FragmentQueue to an inner class here where it belongs; it's undesired to have multiple top level classes in one source file.\n\nAnshum Gupta Is it alright if I commit this to 7.0? It helps avoid a more serious problem as referenced in the description (which further can be a potential DOS attack) but it itself is merely a minor improvement to error checking. ",
