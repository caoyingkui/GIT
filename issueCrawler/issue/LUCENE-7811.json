    "description": "Counting up facets should take advantage of concurrent hardware if the index has multiple segments.\n\nAt first I tried to add an optional ExecutorService argument to the existing single-threaded SortedSetDocValuesFacetCounts but it was difficult, so I just made a new class.\n\nI also internally refactored SortedSetDocValuesFacetCounts to share code between its count and countAll private methods, and switched the FacetsCollector to use DocIdSetBuilder instead of always using a FixedBitSet.",
