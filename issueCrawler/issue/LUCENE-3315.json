    "description": "It would be useful to have an option to discard term frequency information but still keep the positions. Currently, setOmitTermFreqAndPositions discards both. The recent commit LUCENE-2048 adds the flexibility to discard only the positions. With the new option to discard frequency, position-dependent queries can continue to work, and whoever can afford to ignore the scoring based on tf can save a lot on the index size.",
