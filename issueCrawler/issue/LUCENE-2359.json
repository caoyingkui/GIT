    "description": "Test case:  \nPoints all around the globe, plus two points at 0, 179.9 and 0,-179.9 (on each side of the meridian).  Then, do a Cartesian Tier filter on a point right near those two.  It will return all the points when it should just return those two.\n\nThe flawed logic is in the else clause below:\n\nif (longX2 != 0.0) {\n\t\t//We are around the prime meridian\n\t\tif (longX == 0.0) {\n\t\t\tlongX = longX2;\n\t\t\tlongY = 0.0;\n        \tshape = getShapeLoop(shape,ctp,latX,longX,latY,longY);\n\t\t} else {//we are around the 180th longitude\n\t\t\tlongX = longX2;\n\t\t\tlongY = -180.0;\n\t\t\tshape = getShapeLoop(shape,ctp,latY,longY,latX,longX);\n\t}\n\n\n\nBasically, the Y and X values are transposed.  This currently says go from longY (-180) all the way around  to longX which is the lower left longitude of the box formed.  Instead, it should go from the lower left long to -180.",
