    "description": "The queries (1) \"+this +tree\" and (2) \"this AND tree\" should both be parsed to\nthe same query-object.\n\nthe following code-snippet shows a bug in QueryParser.\nQuery (1) is correctly parsed. Parsing Query (2) results in an\nIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\nIt seems that the Parser first removes the stop-word \"this\", resulting in the\nquery \"AND tree\" and then fails to parse this query. Replacing \"this\" by a\nnon-stopWord produces no errors.\n\ntry {\n  StandardAnalyzer tAnalyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();\n\n  Query tQuery1 = QueryParser.parse(\"+this +tree\", \"content\", tAnalyzer);\n  System.out.println(tQuery1.toString(\"content\"));\n\n  Query tQuery2 = QueryParser.parse(\"this AND tree\", \"content\", tAnalyzer);\n  //never reached!\n  System.out.println(tQuery2.toString(\"content\"));\n} catch ( Exception e ) {\n  e.printStackTrace();\n}",
