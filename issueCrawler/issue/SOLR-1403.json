    "description": "Using the Prototype javascript library in the same page as the SolrJS javascript library does not work. It triggers the following error:\n\nstacktrace:   Line 303 of linked script http://localhost:8080/ontopoly/solr/solrjs-1.4-dev.js\n    \t  \tthis.widgets[id].doRequest(query, start, resultsOnly);\n  ...\n\nThe problem is that Prototype redefines the each function in the Array class. And that does not work with the for-in loop syntax in javascript.\n\nThe fix is to change the widgets and selectionViews arrays defined in jQuery.solrjs.Manager from arrays to proper associative arrays:\n\n  widgets : {},\n  ...\n  selectionViews : {},\n\nFrom what I can see these two properties are supposed to be proper associative arrays anyway, and not arrays with string keys.\n\nMore background on this problem can be found here: http://andrewdupont.net/2006/05/18/javascript-associative-arrays-considered-harmful/",
