Previously, when not dealing with an index there was a case or two that didn't use it (writing properties files) and places did not use it when it was known that a Directory was already created, so not passing it had no affect. Now we just consistently pass it everywhere - no warning messages, no worries about is it safe to not pass it here, etc. "
