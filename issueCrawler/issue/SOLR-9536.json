    "description": "On IRC, a 6.2.0 user reported getting an NPE from SnapShooter.deleteOldBackups L244, with the only other frame of the stacktrace being lambda$createSnapAsync$1 L196 (it was a screenshot, not text easily cut/paste here)\n\nThe problematic L244 is...\n\n  if (obd.getTimestamp().isPresent()) {\n\n\n..and i believe the root of the issue is that while getTimestamp() is declared to return an Optional<Date>, there is no guarantee that the Optional instance is itself non-null...\n\n\n   private Optional<Date> timestamp;\n\n  public OldBackupDirectory(URI basePath, String dirName) {\n    this.dirName = Preconditions.checkNotNull(dirName);\n    this.basePath = Preconditions.checkNotNull(basePath);\n    Matcher m = dirNamePattern.matcher(dirName);\n    if (m.find()) {\n      try {\n        this.timestamp = Optional.of(new SimpleDateFormat(SnapShooter.DATE_FMT, Locale.ROOT).parse(m.group(1)));\n      } catch (ParseException e) {\n        this.timestamp = Optional.empty();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\nAllthough i'm not 100% certain, I believe the way the user was triggering this bug was by configuring classic replication configured with something like <str name=\"replicateAfter\">commit</str> \u2013 so that usage may be neccessary to trigger the exception?\n\nAlternatively: perhaps this exception gets logged the first time anyone tries to use any code that involves SnapShooter \u2013 and after that a timestamp file is created and teh problem neer manifests itself again?",
