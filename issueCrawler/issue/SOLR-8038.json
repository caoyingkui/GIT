    "description": "Currently the SQL interface only supports aggregate functions when a GROUP BY clause is present. This ticket will add the capability to query for aggregates without a GROUP BY clause.\n\nExample:\n\nselect max(a), sum(b), min(c) from table1.\n\nThe underlying implementation will be a StatsStream class which outputs the results from a StatsComponent query as a single Tuple.",
