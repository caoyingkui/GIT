    "description": "If the directory where the index is stored gets somehow corrupted, and it becomes empty or the segments files are deleted, any attempt to access the Solr server (via /select, /update, etc..) will throw the following exception:\n\n\norg.apache.lucene.index.IndexNotFoundException: no segments* file found in org.apache.lucene.store.NIOFSDirectory@/index_dir\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only workaround we have found is to stop the server, remove the /index directory, and start again.\n\nWe have found more useful to create a new implementation of the IndexReaderFactory (that extends StandardIndexReaderFactory), that, in case of a IndexNotFoundException, it tries to \"fix\" the index directory by opening an IndexWriter on it and doing a commit:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public IndexReader newReader(Directory indexDir, boolean readOnly) throws IOException {\n        try {\n            return super.newReader(indexDir, readOnly);\n        } catch (IndexNotFoundException e) {\n            logger.warn(\n                    \"Warning: Trying to get a new reader threw an exception. Trying to create a writer first, and then get the reader\",\n                    e);\n            IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_34, new WhitespaceAnalyzer(\n                    Version.LUCENE_34));\n            config.setOpenMode(OpenMode.CREATE_OR_APPEND);\n            IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(indexDir, config);\n            writer.commit();\n            writer.close();\n            try {\n                return super.newReader(indexDir, readOnly);\n            } catch (IndexNotFoundException e2) {\n                logger.error(\n                        \"Trying to commit in the writer didn't work, as the reader is still throwing an exception :(. Re-throwing exception\",\n                        e2);\n                throw e2;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\nWould it make sense to add something like this to the StandardIndexReaderFactory?",
