    "description": "Currently we allow to pass in the actual words as a long[] to the FixedBitSet yet if this array is oversized with respect to the actual words it needs to hold the bits the FixedBitSet can return wrong results since we use words.length (bits.lenght) as the bounds when we iterate over the bits ie. if we need to find the next set bit. We should use the actual bound rather than the size of the array. \n\nas a site note, I think it would be interesting to explore passing an offset to this too to enable to create bitsets from slices....",
