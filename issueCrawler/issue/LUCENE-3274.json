    "description": "It was suggested by Robert in http://markmail.org/message/wbfuzfamtn2qdvii that we should try to limit the dependency graph between modules and where there is something 'common' it should probably go into lucene core.  Given that I haven't added anything to this module except the MutableValue classes, I'm going to collapse them into the util package, remove the module, and correct the dependencies.",
