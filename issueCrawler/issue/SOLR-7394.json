I eventually used the API to request recovery to trigger them to recover and come back online, otherwise the shards stayed down indefinitely.\n\nHari Sekhon\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/harisekhon",

I'm attaching a screenshot from the Cloud admin UI showing both replicas of a myCollection1 shard2 marked as recovery failed and the logs from all nodes.\n\nWhat appears to have happened was both replicas ended up with failed recovery and neither wanted to them become leader and retry. The reason for both having failed recovery is not clear however. ",
