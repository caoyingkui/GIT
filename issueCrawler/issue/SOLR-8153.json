    "description": "The version of the Presto parser currently in Solr is lower casing all SQL identifiers unless they are string literals (single quotes). This appears to be happening in the QualifiedName class.\n\nThe latest version of the Presto parser has changed the QualifiedName class to maintain the original casing. This will allow Solr to maintain the original case of SQL identifiers without requiring quoted identifiers.",
