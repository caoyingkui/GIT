E.g. ping.jsp is broken now.\n\nI propose to use the jasper installation shipped with jetty's JAR files in the example folder and use its <jspc> ANT task to try to compile the JSP pages. Just to test that this works.",

I added this to the war task and also to the main test task as last step.\n\nSo WAR file build and ant test now fail when any JSP is broken.\n\nThe following JSPs are broken:\n\n\tping.jsp\n\tget_file.jsp\n\traw_schema.jsp\n\n\n\nThey are no longer needed, so I will remove them when I commit this!
