            "content": "Thanks for reporting this Grzegorz,\n\nThe general problem seems to be that while CurrencyField has a CurrencyValueSource that it uses for range queries and sorting, it doesn't override FieldType.getValueSource() to return one of these in cases when people use currency fields in functions. \n\nEven with this simple addition however, your test as written still doesn't pass, because CurrencyValueSource operates using the internal \"long\" values of the currency, based on Currency.getDefaultFractionDigits() for the default currency .. so if USD is the configured default, you get a value of \"500.0\" (cents) from the value source instead of \"5.0\" when a document is indexed with a value of \"5,USD\".\n\nI've attached a patch with the trivial getVaueSource() and tests showing the current behavior, but i'm not entirely certain if this is really the behavior we want ... changing it would probably require some meaty rewrites to CurrencyValueSource to take in options about whether the getDefaultFractionDigits() logic should be \"undone\" to produce the more human friendly values ... or perhaps just wrapping it in a special ValueSource that applies that logic in the getValueSource case so existing usages in getRangeQuery would be unaffected.
