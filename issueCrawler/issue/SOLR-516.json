But the title field provides users with\ninformation smaller than body field.\nIn this case, you can use f.body.hl.alternateFieldLen=100 to limit the body length to 100 characters.",

Since it is so long anyway, it doesn't hurt to be explicit.\n\nI have zero familiarity with the ruby side of Solr, so I will leave the issue open for the ruby client patch to be reviewed and applied.
