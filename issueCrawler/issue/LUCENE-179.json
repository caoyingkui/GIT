    "description": "Here's the patch to implement the per-query Similarity access\n\nDoug described it like that : \n*********************************************************************\nBefore that, Similarity was global: there was only one implementation.\nI could think of cases where it might make sense to have it per-query,\nbut that also seemed too fine-grained, so I opted to make it\nper-searcher.  But perhaps it really should be possible to specify a\ndifferent Similarity implementation for different queries.\n\nHere's a proposal.  We add a method to Query as follows:\n\n   public Query#getSimilarity(Searcher searcher) \n{\n      return searcher.getSimilarity();\n   }\n\nThen change all of the Weight and Scorer code to call this in place of\nSearcher#getSimilarity().  This permits one to subclass a Query class so\nthat it can specify it's own Similarity implementation, perhaps one that\ndelegates through that of the Searcher.\n*********************************************************************\n\nWith that patch the Scorer objets are not modified because they access their own\nSimilarity field which is specified by the Weight objects.\n\nThis patch passes all junit tests",
