Open a JIRA only when there's something actionable or we have specific insights on what is going wrong.\n\nMy hunch is that you're running out of disk space (when under heavy load) due to logs taking up a lot of space? Also, if you're not setting autocommit, then the tlog size could also be increasing boundlessly. ",
