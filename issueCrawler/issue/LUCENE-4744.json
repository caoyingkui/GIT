            "content": "here my proposal... I basically added a TermsEnum filter(TermsEnum) method to the Parser Interface such that Numeric parsers can simply use a FilteredTermsEnum instead of throwing this exception. I think this is way more elegant and might be helpful for other usecases where you only want certain terms to be in the FieldCache (ie. only high-frequent?)\nbut that is a different story ",
