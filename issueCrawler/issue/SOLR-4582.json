    "description": "Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x, I realized that the location for infostream had changed from a core-specific directory to CWD or jetty.home, not sure which.  To get around this, I included \n\n${solr.core.name}\n\n in the infostream filename.  Because I had a simple workaround, I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nWhen I upgraded to 4.3-SNAPSHOT, suddenly solr.core.name disappeared (SOLR-4575).  This got me thinking about why I had changed infostream in the first place, and that perhaps the default location should be dataDir, similar to 3.x.",

The file went into the current working directory, which means my recollection of how it worked in 3.x was incorrect.\n\nClosing this issue as invalid and open a new one with my reasoning on why we should change the default location.
