    "description": "CloudSolrClient.directUpdate() has this \"optimization\":\n\n    if (router instanceof ImplicitDocRouter) {\n      // short circuit as optimization\n      return null;\n    }\n\n\nPresumably this was correct prior to router.field became a way for one to choose where docs go for the implicit router.  Instead, this code should continue normally if router.field is set.  \n\nIf it's not set, this code could return null. But then what should the caller do?  It appears that if _route_ is set then that spells out where the doc will go, otherwise it'll go to all shards.  The all-shards behavior is quite likely a gotcha/error but there's perhaps a slim chance someone wants this behavior?",
