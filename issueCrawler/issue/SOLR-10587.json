This is to deliver on our back-compat promise between minor versions.",

            "content": "Attached patch makes the required changes to IndexSchema.  A few notes:\n\n\n\tincludes a negative test in BadIndexSchemaTest for the combination of defaultSearchField and luceneMatchVersion\n\tthere are some tests that fail with this patch on current master or branch_6x.  There's a good number of schema's which still include defaultSearchField.  As I understand what I read on SOLR-7041, these test failures are \"expected\" for now, as the work to change these schemas is still ongoing.  Just wanted to mention them here explicitly as a disclaimer, or in case I'm misunderstanding something and there's actual issues with the patch.\n\n\n\nAs a side note, in writing this patch, I noticed that most/all of the error cases in IndexSchema throw a SolrException with 500/ServerError.  I'm not entirely sure how these status codes propagate out of this layer; maybe the status codes get changed in some cases before being returned to users.  But it might be more intuitive/correct to expose these as 400's/BadRequest.  I know that runs into deprecation concerns, and all that.  Just wanted to check my understanding and make sure I was reading things correctly before creating a JIRA. ",

            "content": "Thanks for contributing. Comments:\n\n\tWe should keep the WARNING about deprecation, the one you changed from WARN to INFO\n\tbad-schema-defaultsearchfield.xml can be much smaller, e.g.\n\n<schema name=\"bad-schema-defaultsearchfield\" version=\"1.6\">\n  <fieldType name=\"string\" class=\"solr.StrField\"/>\n  <field name=\"id\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" multiValued=\"false\" required=\"false\"/>\n  <uniqueKey>id</uniqueKey>\n  <!-- BEGIN BAD STUFF: not allowed anymore -->\n  <defaultSearchField>id</defaultSearchField>\n  <!-- END BAD STUFF -->\n</schema>\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you like to submit an updated patch?\n\nWrt converting existing tests into using \"df\" I think we can use SOLR-7041 for that and commit same to both master and branch_6x. I think we should just do a series of smaller commits until all tests are converted, and once that is done this one can be committed. ",
