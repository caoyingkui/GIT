Why would that happen? are we not matching whole words?\n\nI think a better fix would be to match the full -Djetty.port=$SOLR_PORT string.\n\nMany OS do not have netstat by default e.g. centos minimal. Docker-solr which uses a stripped down version of debian also does not have netstat by default. Also, the -p switch used in the patch is not supported on MacOS. (thanks to Martijn Koster for these tips). ",

Solr doesn't do that which is why we have this problem.\n\nTo me simply using the grep , even with the exact phrase ( \"-Djetty.port=$SOLR_PORT\"), could drive to errors.\n\nShort of writing/using pid files, I think this is the best available workaround?\n\n<edit> - I wasn't clear earlier but the intention is to match the whole word i.e. grepping for -Djetty.port=1050 should not match -Djetty.port=10500 ",
