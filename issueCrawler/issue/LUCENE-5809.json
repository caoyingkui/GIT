    "description": "While looking at this scorer i see a few little things which are remnants of the past:\n\n\tcrazy heuristics to use next() over advance(): I think it should just use advance(), like conjunctionscorer. these days advance() isnt stupid anymore\n\tincorrect leapfrogging. the lead scorer is never advanced if a subsequent scorer goes past it, it just falls into this nextDoc() loop.\n\tpre-next()'ing: we are using cost() api to sort, so there is no need to do that.\n\tUnionDocsAndPositionsEnum doesnt follow docsenum contract and set initial doc to -1\n\tpostingsreader advance() doesnt need to check docFreq > BLOCK_SIZE on each advance call, thats easy to remove.\n\n\n\nSo I think really this scorer should just look like \"conjunctionscorer that verifies positions on match\".",

As the number of terms increase, wrong leapfrogging has a higher impact I think. Maybe another reason is the phrase selection is based on how common the phrase is, but doesnt have good enough variety (like rare phrase but high frequency terms).\n\nAnyway I think this is good to go, unless you have concerns.
