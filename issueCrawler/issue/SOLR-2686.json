    "description": "I would consider this a bug. It appears lots of people are working around this limitation, \nwhy don't we just change the underlying data structures to natively support multiValued fields in the FieldCache architecture?\n\nThen functions() will work properly, and we can do things like easily geodist() on a multiValued field.\n\nThoughts?",

So FieldCache on a multiValued field works by consuming it from FieldCache.DocTermOrds but,\n\n\n\tI was trying out FunctionQuery in Solr and still got a \"cannot FieldCache on multiValued field\" error. This is because any impl. of FieldCacheSource for example StrFieldSource#getValues() returns DocTermsIndexDocValues where FieldCache.DocTermsIndex instance loads up. Is this supposed to be consumed like this?\n\n\n\n\n\tSecondly slightly off topic but I went through the lucene4547 branch where there was a discussion on how to consume DocValues. I'm still trying to figure a lot of stuff around DocValues, FieldCache etc. but do we need to discuss all these issues and it's impact on Solr and ES as a whole?\n\n "
