Using parameterized logging statements, ie 'log.debug(\"Blah {}\", o)' will avoid incurring that cost.",

            "content": "+1 to the idea.\n\nAlso, from memory the parameterized log message have (or perhaps had) a limit on how many args can follow the first arg but this can be overcome e.g. like this:\n\nlog.debug(\"calling waitForLeaderToSeeDownState for coreZkNodeName={} collection={} shard={}\", new Object[]{coreZkNodeName, collection, slice});\n\n\n\nAlso wondering, once the code is cleaned up, could something similar to the forbidden-apis check be used to prevent the re-introduction of unparameterized debug/trace log messages?\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, there are many debug and trace level logging statements, if any particularly stood out in your samplings, perhaps we could start here by changing those?
