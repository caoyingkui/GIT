The summary sounds kind of buggish ...\n\nI'll try to restrain myself, but I think we should have fixed unicode 4 support in lucene 3.0, because then it matches the unicode version of java 1.5\nthe problem is we could not do any of this in 2.9, because you need java 1.5 to actually implement most of the support, so it was a chicken and egg problem.\n\nimho its all bugs, but i'll list these issues as improvements  ",
