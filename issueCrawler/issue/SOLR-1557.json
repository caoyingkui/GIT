The shards param is using StrUtils.splitSmart() which handles quoting and backslash escape characters \u2013 neither of which really make sense for a list of URLs.\n\nI'm totally fine with not allowing whitespace if you had a compelling reason for excluding it \u2013 i've been vocally opposed to supporting comma delimited values for things like this anyway but we need to leave it for back compatibility \u2013 my main concern is that we start supporting \"shard\" it as a multivalued param.
