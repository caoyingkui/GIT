It'd be pretty easy for a client with a bug in their request building code to accidentally delete their preferences/policies because a variable on their end was unexpectedly null.\n\nWould it be reasonable to rely on a different flag value here instead?  Maybe \"{}\" or \"[]\" (empty JSON, empty JSON array) instead?\n\nFeel free to discard this suggestion though, as I don't have a ton of context on this part of the code.\n ",
