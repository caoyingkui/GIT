    "description": "This ticket adds a specific class that registers all the Streaming Expression functions with the StreamFactory. It also adds a test case that ensures that a list of expected functions are registered, and enforces that any new functions that are registered are added to the expected list of functions in the test case. This ensures that functions cannot be deregistered by accident in the future.",
