    "description": "I am having a problem with degraded performance when using the collapseQParserPlugin with facet tagging.\n\nAn example query would look something like this\n\n\nhttp://host:port/solr/index/handler?facet=true&fq={!collapse field=groupid}&facet.query={!ex=Width_numeric}Width_numeric:[10+TO+15]&facet.query={!ex=Width_numeric}Width_numeric:[15+TO+20]&facet.sort=index&start=0&q=36+x+42+shower+base&fq={!tag%3DWidth_numeric}Width_numeric:[35+TO+40]\n\n\n\nWhen I either remove the grouping\n\nfq={!collapse field=groupid}\n\n\n\nor remove the tag\n\n&fq={!tag%3DWidth_numeric}Width_numeric:[35+TO+40]\n\n\n\nI am getting requests orders of magnitude faster. In my production environment with around 800k documents. I jump from less than 20ms to over 100ms sometimes 200ms using the collapsingQParserPlugin with tagging.\n\nThe issue can be observed in the TestCollapseQParserPlugin tests:\n\n\nparams.add(\"q\", \"*:*\");\n    params.add(\"fq\", \"{!collapse field=group_s}\");\n    params.add(\"defType\", \"edismax\");\n    params.add(\"bf\", \"field(test_ti)\");\n    params.add(\"facet\", \"true\");\n    params.add(\"facet.field\", \"{!ex=test_ti}test_ti\");\n    params.add(\"fq\", \"{!tag=test_ti}test_ti:10\");\n    assertQ(req(params), \"*[count(//doc)=3]\",\n                       \"//result/doc[1]/float[@name='id'][.='2.0']\",\n                       \"//result/doc[2]/float[@name='id'][.='6.0']\"\n        );\n\n\n\nWith this test with the tagging I ran 10 tests and consistently got response times between 23-28ms. When I removed the tag and ran 10 more tests I consistently got results between 15-18ms\n\nIn all cases if I don't use the collapseQParserPlugin with tagging by either removing the tag or leaving the tag but removing the collapse I am getting poor performance.",

            "content": "You will see a performance hit when you use tag and exclude because Solr needs to regenerate the DocSet. So, the query needs to be re-run. If Collapsing is part of the query, then collapsing is re-run also. Would be interesting to put some timing statements in the FacetComponent, where it recreates the docset for tag/exclude, to see long this is taking. "

            "content": "The timing jumps pretty dramatically in my index with around 800k documents. I have observed an increase of 100-200 ms when using tagging. Using tagging by itself without grouping the requests are less than 20ms. Using grouping without tagging the requests are < 20ms. This makes me think that using them together that the requests would be < 40ms but this is not the case. "
