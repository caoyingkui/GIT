    "description": "My company uses Solr aliases to limit the configuration changes that we need to support.\nThe CDCR configuration seems to accept an alias for either the source or target collections, and no errors show up in the log, but no data is replicated if the source or target is an alias and not an actual collection.\n\nI see that aliases are not even mentioned in the CDCR documentation. It seems to me this should either work or throw an error.\nIt should be documented one way or another",

Alias should definitely work for target collections in CDCR, need to confirm the same for source. Check in the logs once, Forwarded X updates to target collection Y in source and /update in target.

It is very similar to other cases where the state.json for a collection cannot be retrieved from ZK as we are referring to alias. I am not sure how much effort is required to make it work. ",
