    "description": "blob store is provided as a feature and the only current use is to load jars from there. Ideally, all resources should be loadable from blob store. But, it is not yet ready for prime time because it is just a simple crud handler for binary files. We should provide nice wrappers (java APIs as well as http APIs) which mask the complexity of the underlying storage.",
