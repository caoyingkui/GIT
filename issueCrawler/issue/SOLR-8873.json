    "description": "We currently support any valid path for dataDir/instanceDir/ulogDir. I think we should prevent special characters and restrict to a subset that is commonly used and tested.\nMy initial proposals it to allow the Java pattern: \n\n\"^[a-zA-Z0-9\\\\.\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\-_/\\\"':]+$\"\n\n but I'm open to suggestions. I'm not sure if there can be issues with HDFS paths (this pattern does pass the tests we currently have), or some other use case I'm not considering.\nI also think our tests should use all those characters randomly.",

Again, I'm not 100% sure that this will not break valid use cases, probably the pattern needs to be expanded. \nFor example, the pattern would not accept accented characters, and since this is checking the absolute path, tests would not pass if your lucene-solr root is on an unsupported path ",

Maybe we can go the other way and just block some characters, but testing will be more difficult. ",
