            "content": "This adds a module called \"label\" as a prototype for index-time positional joins by labeled text fragments.\n\nThis provides a 1 : 0..n positional join.\nIt is a generalization of FieldMaskingSpanQuery that provides a 1 : 1 positional join. \n\nAt indexing time labeled text fragments for a document are analysed from a TokenStream.\n\nIn package org.apache.lucene.analysis.label such a labeled fragments stream is split into\na label stream, and into pairs of streams for fragments and fragment positions.\nA fragment is series of tokens, possibly empty.\nThe fragments in each fragment stream will be contiguous,\nthe labels and the other fragment streams have no influence on their positions.\n\nThe output streams can be used to provide documents with different fields per stream.\nIt is up to the user to associate the output streams with fields in documents to be indexed for search.\n\nLabels and fragments are represented at query time by Spans.\nQuerying labeled fragments with positional joins is supported in package org.apache.lucene.search.spans.label.\n\nThis implementation uses EliasFanoBytes (LUCENE-5524) to compress a payload with start/end positions.\nThese have a value index, which allows for fast fragment to label associations.\nCurrently these have no position index, so label to fragment associations will be somewhat slower.\nSince payloads need to be loaded completely during searches, this will not have high performance for larger payloads.\n\nThis is a prototype because I don't expect high performance for larger payloads.\nAll code javadocs are marked experimental.

This is implemented in an added package private LabelQuery that is the superclass of all positional joins queries.\n\tvarious improved/simplified hashCode/equals methods, removal of unused imports.\n\tLeafFragmentsQuery was deleted, this was untested and not working well. I'll add it again later. This provided the non empty leaf fragments from a label tree, and this is occasionally good to have.\n\tthe test code uses SpanWithinQuery from core.\n\n\n\nThe util.eliasfano package has a new BitSelect class which is based on the recently removed BitUtil.select method.\nI'll move the util.eliasfano package into the label module here later, in the patch it is in the core module.\n\nThe patch was prepared on an svn checkout of the 5.2 branch.
