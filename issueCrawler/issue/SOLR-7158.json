    "description": "The separator for zk nodes is '/'. However, on Windows, while uploading the relative files nested within a directory (e.g. velocity\\hit-plain.vm) contain '\\'. This, apart from causing an inconsistency as compared to zk on posix systems, messed up the ZkCLITest on Windows where count of files in zk and files in the filesystem was compared.",

            "content": "Ah, I see what you mean! Actually, because of the second issue with the path separator, something like velocity\\plain-hit.vm was not being considered as a subpath, and thus the Files.write() was attempting to create a single file with that name (velocity\\plain-hit.vm), which failed. Hence, I tried to explicitly create the sub directory (velocity) by calling createDirectories(filename.getParent()), which in view of the path separator fix seems redundant.  Thanks for the catch! ",

Just checked on Windows, it works fine!\nA quick lookup at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#Representations_of_paths_by_operating_system_and_shell convinces me that we can actually hardcode \"\\\" for the check for separator (as you've done here). That might also make it fine (more performant?) to replace Pattern.quote(separator) with \"\\\\\\\\\"? ",
