ObjectSolrParams is a new SolrParams implementation that can deal with objects rather than just strings, and JSON is used to populate that.\n\nLots of stuff \"just works\" since it simply builds on our QParser framework and all of the existing QParser implementations.\n\nExamples of what currently works:\n\n{'term':{'id':'11'}}\n{'field':{'text':'Now Cow'}}\n{'prefix':{'text':'brow'}}\n{'frange':{'v':'mul(foo_i,2)', 'l':20,'u':24}}}\n{'join':{'from':'qqq_s', 'to':'www_s', 'v':'id:10'}}\n{'join':{'from':'qqq_s', 'to':'www_s', 'v':{'term':{'id':'10'}}}}\n{'lucene':'text:Cow -id:1'}\n\n "
