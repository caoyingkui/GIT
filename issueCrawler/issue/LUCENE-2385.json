Also includes the relevant changes to benchmark (algorithms + CreateIndexTask).\nI've fixed a typo I had in NoMergeScheduler - not related to this issue, but since it was just a typo, thought it's no harm to do it here.\n\nTests pass. Planning to commit shortly. ",

Is that ok for this file (b/c I have no idea how to do the svn move now ... after I've made all the changes already)  ",

If you paste those commands into your terminal and then apply the patch, it works. One example is the jflex issue (ok, the commands are shortened).\n\nAnother possibility is to have a second checkout, where you arrange the files correctly (svn moved/copied) and one for creating the patches.
