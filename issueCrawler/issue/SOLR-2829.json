    "description": "I don't know how generic this is, whether it's just a\nproblem with fqs when combined with spatial or whether\nit has wider applicability , but here's what I know so far.\n\nMarc Tinnemeyer in a post titled:\n\n\"Regarding geodist and multiple location fields\"\noutlines this. I checked this on 3.4 and trunk and it's\nweird in both cases.\n\nHOLD THE PRESSES:\nAfter looking at this a bit more, it looks like a caching\nissue, NOT a geodist issue. When I bounce Solr\nbetween changing the sfield from \"home\" to \"work\",\nit seems to work as expected.\n\nHmmmm, very strange. If I comment out BOTH\nthe filterCache and queryResultCache then it works\nfine. Switching from \"home\" to \"work\" in the query\nfinds/fails to find the document.\nBut commenting out only one of those caches\ndoesn't fix the problem.\n\non trunk I used this query; just flipping \"home\" to \"work\" and back:\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=id:1&fq=\n{!geofilt sfield=home\npt=52.67,7.30 d=5}\n\n\nThe info below is what I used to test.\n\nFrom Marc's posts:\n\n<field name=\"home\" type=\"location\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\n<field name=\"work\" type=\"location\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\n<field name=\"elsewhere\" type=\"location\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\n\nAt first I thought so too. Here is a simple document.\n\n<add>\n      <doc>\n              <field name=\"id\">1</field>\n              <field name=\"name\">first</field>\n              <field name=\"work\">48.60,11.61</field>\n              <field name=\"home\">52.67,7.30</field>\n      </doc>\n</add>\n\nand here is the result that shouldn't be:\n\n<response>\n...\n<str name=\"q\">:</str>\n<str name=\"fq\">\n{!geofilt sfield=work pt=52.67,7.30 d=5}\n</str>\n...\n</lst>\n</lst>\n<result name=\"response\" numFound=\"1\" start=\"0\">\n<doc>\n<str name=\"home\">52.67,7.30</str>\n<str name=\"id\">1</str>\n<str name=\"name\">first</str>\n<str name=\"work\">48.60,11.61</str>\n</doc>\n</result>\n</response>\n\n***Yonik's comment*****\n\nIt's going to be a bug in an equals() implementation somewhere in the query.\nThe top level equals will be SpatialDistanceQuery.equals() (from\nLatLonField.java)\n\nOn trunk, I already see a bug introduced when the new lucene field\ncache stuff was done.\nDoubleValueSource now just inherits it's equals method from\nNumericFieldCacheSource... and that equals() method only tests if the\nCachedArrayCreator.getClass() is the same!  That's definitely wrong.\n\nI don't know why 3x would also have this behavior (unless there's more\nthan one bug!)\nAnyway, first step is to modify the spatial tests to catch the bug...\nfrom there it should be pretty easy to debug.",

Given that \"creator\" is never null (for trie fields at least) this always boils down to just comparing the creator class.\nWhat normally saves us is that the hash code will normally slot to a different bucket, and the fact that we start off with a relatively large number of buckets (size=512, which means 1024 buckets when accounting for load factor and rounding up to the next power of two).\n\nThis is a bad bug since it can stay hidden and strike randomly.\n\n(unless you know of some reason why NumericFieldCacheSource should only care about equality on this.creator.getClass() instead of this.creator ?)\n\nI never fully grokked the creator stuff... and I understand the trunk fieldcache code is slated to be replaced by the 3x fieldcache code, so I wouldn't worry about cleaning anything up (other than making it work).
