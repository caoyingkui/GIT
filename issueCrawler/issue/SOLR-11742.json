            "content": "Thanks for uploading a patch in progress. I have a little bit of feedback:\n\n\n\tYou've got spaces between colons in many of the new the params sections, like * `numeric array` :  The first numeric array. The extra spaces are distracting without serving a purpose, and I'll just have to go through and fix them anyway. If you can fix now and not put them in, that would be great.\n\tThere are a number of expressions that end up being removed, is that intentional? I didn't check if they are referred to elsewhere, but that's fine if they are - also fine if they should be removed because they're no longer in the code, just wanted to check.\n\tFunction names are inconsistently monospaced - looks like the first time a function is mentioned it's put between backticks, but not any subsequent usages. We should be consistent and do it every time a function is not in a section title.\n\n ",

            "content": "Ok,\n\nI'll remove the spaces between the colons.\n\nThe functions that have been removed have been consolidated or been made redundant by another function. For example there used to be a distance function for each different type of distance. Now there is one distance function with a named parameter called \"type\" where you specify what type of distance to compute. The patch does not fully reflect this yet as I'm still working on the distance and corr function docs.\n\nI'll use backticks for function names everywhere.  ",
