    "description": "CustomScoreQuery's constructor currently accepts a subQuery, and a ValueSourceQuery.  I would like it to accept multiple ValueSourceQueries.  The workaround of nested CustomScoreQueries works for simple cases, but it quickly becomes either cumbersome to manage, or impossible to implement the desired function.\n\nThis patch implements CustomMultiScoreQuery with my desired functionality, and refactors CustomScoreQuery to implement the special case of a CustomMultiScoreQuery with 0 or 1 ValueSourceQueries.  This keeps the CustomScoreQuery API intact.\n\nThis patch includes basic tests, more or less taken from the original implementation, and customized a bit to cover the new cases.",

I really want to be able to override it with custom logic.  Also note that multiplying twice is currently as simple as CustomScoreQuery(CustomScoreQuery(subQuery, value1), value2).  But what about things that aren't linear combinations?\n\nUse case:  I want the score to fall off exponentially as content ages, with a decay rate that varies on a per document basis.  \n\nEach document has three fields: \"text,\" \"created-at,\" and \"half-life.\"  Created-at is represented as a UNIX timestamp, and half-life in seconds.  I'm not sure that the following query is able to be expressed as nested queries.  There may be another way to do this, but this seems simple and elegant to me.\n\n\npublic class DateDecayQuery extends CustomScoreQuery {\n\tpublic final double LOG2 = Math.log(2);\n\tprivate long now;\n\n\tpublic DateDecayQuery(Query subQuery) {\n\t\tsuper(subQuery, new ValueSourceQuery[] {\n\t\t\t\tnew FieldScoreQuery(\"created-at\", Type.INT),\n\t\t\t\tnew FieldScoreQuery(\"half-life\", Type.INT) });\n\t\tnow = new Date().getTime() / 1000; // UNIX timestamp;\n\t\tsetStrict(true);\n\t}\n\n\tpublic float customScore(int doc, float score, float fields[]) {\n\t\tfloat date = fields[0];\n\t\tfloat halfLife = fields[1];\n\t\tfloat dateScore = (float) Math.exp(LOG2 * (date - now) / halfLife);\n\t\treturn score * dateScore;\n\t}\n}\n\n ",
