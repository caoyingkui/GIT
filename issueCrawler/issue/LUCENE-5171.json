    "description": "In my code I use both suggesters for the same FST. I use AnalyzerSuggester#store() to create the FST and later on AnalyzingSuggester#load() and FuzzySuggester#load() to use it.\nThis approach works very well but it unnecessarily creates 2 fst instances resulting in 2x memory consumption.\n\nIt seems that for the time being both suggesters use the same FST format.\n\nThe following trivial method in AnalyzingSuggester provides the possibility to share the same FST among different instances of AnalyzingSuggester. It has been tested in the above scenario:\n\n  public boolean shareFstFrom(AnalyzingSuggester instance)\n  {\n    if (instance.fst == null) \n{\n      return false;\n    }\n    this.fst = instance.fst;\n    this.maxAnalyzedPathsForOneInput = instance.maxAnalyzedPathsForOneInput;\n    this.hasPayloads = instance.hasPayloads;\n\n    return true;\n  }\n\n\nOne could use it like this:\n\n  analyzingSugg = new AnalyzingSuggester(...);\n  fuzzySugg = new FuzzySuggester(...);\n  analyzingSugg.load(someInputStream);\n  fuzzySugg = analyzingSugg.shareFstFrom(analyzingSugg);",
