    "description": "Spun off of LUCENE-2604 where everyone agreed this needed done, but no one has done it yet, and rmuir didn't want to leave the issue open...\n\n\nsome issues were pointed out in a recent mailing list thread that definitely seem like they should be addressed before this is officially released...\n\n\n\tqueryparsersyntax.xml doesn't mention this feature at all \u2013 as major new syntax is should really get it's own section with an example showing the syntax\n\tqueryparsersyntax.xml's section on \"Escaping Special Characters\" needs to mention that '/' is a special character\n\n\n\nAlso: Given that Yury encountered some real world situations in which the new syntax caused problems with existing queries, it seems like we should definitely make a note about this possibility more promonient ... i'm not sure if it makes sense in MIGRATE.txt but at a minimum it seems like the existing CHANGES.txt entry should mention it, maybe something like...\n\n\n* LUCENE-2604: Added RegexpQuery support to QueryParser. Regular expressions\n  are now directly supported by the standard queryparser using the syntax... \n     fieldName:/expression/ OR /expression against default field/\n  Users who wish to search for literal \"/\" characters are advised to \n  backslash-escape or quote those characters as needed. \n  (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)",
