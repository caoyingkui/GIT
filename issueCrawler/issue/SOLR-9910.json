Proposing to add -j option to add additional config for jetty (the part after start.jar).\n\nMotivation: jetty can be configured with start.ini in server directory. Running multiple Solr instances, however, requires the configuration per instance that cannot share the start.ini with other instances.",

I'm sure other leakage already exists to some extent, it's tough to generalise every little config outside of Jetty for every feature.\n\nIt's a good point though. I had not considered that Jetty is leaking out of the Solr startup script with this.\n\nOne option is to call it something like 'additional internal startup params' or something indicative of that, and then document it as non backwards compatible internal parameters. I'd worry that if we changed out Jetty, after an upgrade some users may keep sending bad params to Netty or something.\n\nAs you say, we could also just leave it as it is and document it as internal and non back compat as well. That seems like the best option to me.\n\nMano Kovacs, the main motivation is to be able to run multiple Solr instances from a single Solr server directory? ",

So if there is something important we want to support, it's best to try and do it in a more abstract way. In this case, I'm wondering if that is something we actually want to support first class or if we should just say you need a unique Solr folder for every instance.\n\nIf it's not something we care so much about supporting, it's fine to allow unsupported things through some special unsupported config option - but the tradeoff is anyone using that stuff cannot count on it in the future at all. That's not always a very viable path depending on your use case. Even in a point release, devs will be allowed to break this kind of support. So if you cannot count on it fully except at a moment in time, it's a perhaps pretty flakey feature to build anything on. ",
