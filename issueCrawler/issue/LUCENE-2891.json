    "description": "While you can pass -1 to IR.open(), and it's documented, you cannot do the same for IndexWriter's readers (b/c IWC blocks it). Need to allow this setting as well as add support for it in our tests, e.g. we should randomly set it to -1. Robert also suggested RandomIW use -1 randomly when it opens readers.\n\nI'll work on a patch",

I didn't see anywhere, even in IR.open() what are the consequences of not loading the terms index.

Surprisingly, MockRandom also fails. I put all of them into an illegalCodecs Set and if that's what the test draws, the test does not continue and succeeds.\n\nI'll open a separate issue to check why MockRandomCodec fails the test (i.e., why doesn't it honor the -1 setting).
