    "description": "CompressingTermVectorsReader.TVDocsEnum calls checkPosition() and checkDoc() but not from within asserts.  And nextPosition() has some leading checks, also not within asserts.  I believe these should all be within asserts.  This is low-level code that can get called a ton of times, particularly via TokenSources.getTokenStream.\n\nI'd be happy to create a patch there is preliminary agreement.",
