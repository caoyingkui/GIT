            "content": "When excluding facets the search is re-executed (inside SimpleFacets) during the facet phase to get a DocSet for the search without some excluding filters. The problem is that for that search the group.truncate parameter isn't checked. This doesn't happen for normal facets, since the search isn't re-executed.\n\nI think to fix this, the SimpleFacets should re-execute the search with a AllGroupHeadsCollector when group.truncate=true at line 167.
