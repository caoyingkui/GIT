    "description": "Prior to Solr 4.3, it was possible to use the CREATE action on an existing core to point the core to a different config file, schema file or data directory.\n\nUsing the CREATE action to re-configure a core throws an error since Solr 4.3 (deliberately, see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CoreAdmin#CREATE). Instead the procedure is now to use the RELOAD action to pick up changes, but it lacks request parameters config, schema and dataDir to point the core to another file or directory - you can only pickup changes to the files configured during during core creation.\n\nDiscussion of the issue: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Core-admin-action-quot-CREATE-quot-fails-for-existing-core-td4065669.html",
