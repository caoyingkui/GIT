    "description": "I hit this when running a ToParentBlockJoinCollector/Query under\nDrillSideways ... the problem is ToParentBlockJoinCollector.collect\nexpects that all sub-scorers are positioned on the docID being\ncollected, but DrillSideways sometimes scores with a in-order\nBooleanScorer-like scorer that advances each sub-scorer in chunks\n... this breaks ToParentBlockJoinCollector.\n\nThis is the same issue as LUCENE-2686, where apps that want to peek at\nthe sub-scorers from their collector need those sub-scorers to all be\n\"on\" the current docID being collected...\n\nOne way to \"fix\" this would be to switch based on\nCollector.acceptsDocsOutOfOrder() ... but that's really a hack ... it\nonly \"works\" for BooleanQuery because BooleanScorer is an out-of-order\nscorer (well and because we fixed all BS2s to keep sub-scorers\npositioned on the doc being collected in LUCENE-3505).\n\nBut if for example we added MUST clauses back into BooleanScorer\n(which I think we should!) then it could easily score those queries\nin-order.  Really we need another boolean (scoreSubDocsAtOnce or\nsomething) to Weight.scorer... but that's a big change...\n\nI think for this issue I'll just add an expert protected method to\nDrillSideways that returns this boolean, and an app could subclass to\noverride.  Apps that \"know\" they are using queries/collectors like\nToParentBlockJoinQuery/Collector must subclass and override\n... DrillSideways already has other expert methods that you subclass &\noverride.",
