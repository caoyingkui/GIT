One such command is under discussion / development in SOLR-7569 (last few comments), which will let the replica change its last published state. I'm not suggesting right away that we don't do this patch, but do you have any thoughts around it (and recovery of such replicas, in general)? Fyi, Mark Miller. ",

It was weird that running the tests from the IDE never hit this . So that code is fixed\n\n ",
