    "description": "We are using BigDecimals in our application quite often for calculating. We store our values typically as java primitives (int, long/double, float) and using the DocumentObjectBinder (annotations based document object binding). \n\nUnfortunately, we must have exactly the type given in solr schema for type used as field/accessor. We found out, that the following patch would allow us to define BigDecimal as type as we just use BigDecimal as a type in our mapped POJO. This would help to make the mapping more powerful without loosing anything.\n\n----------\n$ svn diff Downloads/solr/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/beans/DocumentObjectBinder.java\nIndex: Downloads/solr/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/beans/DocumentObjectBinder.java\n===================================================================\n\u2014 Downloads/solr/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/beans/DocumentObjectBinder.java     (revision 1626087)\n+++ Downloads/solr/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/beans/DocumentObjectBinder.java     (working copy)\n@@ -359,6 +359,9 @@\n       if (v != null && type == ByteBuffer.class && v.getClass() == byte[].class) \n{\n         v = ByteBuffer.wrap((byte[]) v);\n       }\n+      if (type == java.math.BigDecimal.class)\n{\n+        v = BigDecimal.valueOf(v):\n+      }\n       try {\n         if (field != null) {\n           field.set(obj, v);",

I was going to pick this up and get this into 5x, but I don't use the SolrJ bindings and won't tinker with this without at least a compiling patch.  A test case would be handy to be sure this is doing the right thing as well.  "
