    "description": "Here is the improvement to LOCALSOLR. \n\nAllow radius=-1 to indicate to not limit results by radius from center point. Provide Standard query with 2 enhancements:\n\n\n\tAllow sort by geo_distance\n\tProvide lat/long for center point (origin) and results have distance from this point\n\n\n\nThis would allow results to be relevant to the query, and provide user to sort by distance and display the distance. This is a simple fix the the LOCALSOLR module.\n\nBill",
