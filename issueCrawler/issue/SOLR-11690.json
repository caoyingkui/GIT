    "description": "The password decryption is not working fine because of a bug in JdbcDataSorce.java -> decryptPwd(Context context, Properties initProps) method. The problem is due to bad construction of key string while making a call to CryptoKeys.decodeAES(). Due to this the CryptoKeys throws \"Bad password, algorithm, mode or padding; no salt, wrong number of iterations or corrupted ciphertext.\" exception while trying to decode password.",

That code hasn't been changed in over 2 years, I'd expect others would have run in to this and reported it in the intervening time.\n\nAre you absolutely sure you haven't somehow added an extra character somehow? Have you tried a new password fresh to see if the problem persists or is some user error? Is there any chance you have some binary/text copying issue? ",

It seems the java.io.InputStreamReader.read() always reads the file with extra character at the end of the file. I tried different encryption keys but got the same result. Even i trimmed encryptionKeyFile using command \"cat encryptionKeyFile | tr -d \" \\t\\n\\r\"\" but with no success.\nAs you said other users had also faced similar issue which you can see here http://jezzper.com/jezzper/discussions.nsf/0/4481E9A7ACED95F7C1258069006CB856\nhttps://www.daniweb.com/programming/threads/510043/solr-dataimport-handler-encrypted-pwd-final-block-not-properly-padded\nhttp://search-lucene.com/m/Solr/eHNl2elXj1UDULt1?subj=Re+Problem+with+Password+Decryption+in+Data+Import+Handler\n\nI feel if chopping the last character off is not the ideal solution, I propose we somehow trim the white spaces, for an instance using String.trim() function.

            "content": "I had the exact same issue. For me it was solved by using\n\necho -n \"mypassword\" > pwd.txt\n\n\ninstead of what the refGuide says:\n\necho \"mypassword\" > pwd.txt\n\n\nThe -n flag tells echo to not add a newline, and then it works. So I think this JIRA can result in a documentation fix where we add the -n flag and make a WARNING box detailing that you need to make sure the file contains ONLY the password and nothing else.\n\nI think the problem has to be solved before running openssl, and cannot be fixed in Java code in DIH. Here is the sequence I'd recommend instead of current docs:\n\n\tCreate a file with an encryption key\necho -n \"myencryptionkey\" >\u00a0/var/solr/data/dih-encryptionkey\n\tUse this file name as the \"encryptKeyFile\" parameter in <dataSource> tag in data-config.xml\n\tEncrypt your JDBC password into a string to replace the\u00a0password in the config\necho -n \"my-jdbc-password\" | openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -a -salt -pass file:/var/solr/data/dih-encryptionkey\n\tInsert that string as \"password\" in the <dataSource> tag in data-config.xml. The string will look something like this\nU2FsdGVkX188xHM8QHUbuDapdE3WTLt//Oey9VSRAyE=\n\n\n\nThis procedure is simpler as it avoids storing the jdbc password to file (which must be deleted again), and you also don't need to type the encryption key twice, as we ask openssl to read the same file that DIH will read later ",
