But, maybe we should just do this anyway.\n\n\nOne other thing (separate issue probly): ElisionFilter is in package o.a.l.analysis.fr, but you've added example uses with Italian and Catalan - shouldn't this class move up to package o.a.l.analysis?\n\nYeah its a little awkward: I think maybe it belongs in the .util package?\n\nAlso, we don't sync the english stopwords, (though, it does match lucene's). So thats another improvement we could do, text-file those under .en package\ninstead of being a hardwired set in StopAnalyzer.\n\nI think maybe we could open issues for all of these? I don't like it either, but i decided to go with the TODO approach because\nI'm not sure it should really block this issue (to the user, it will all be the same, this is implementation details). "
