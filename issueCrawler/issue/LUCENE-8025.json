    "description": "Spinoff of LUCENE-8007:\n\nIf you omit term frequencies, we should score as if all tf values were 1. This is the way it worked for e.g. ClassicSimilarity and you can understand how it degrades. \n\nHowever for sims such as BM25, we bail out on computing avg doclength (and just return a bogus value of 1) today, screwing up stuff related to length normalization too, which is separate.\n\nInstead of a bogus value, we should substitute sumDocFreq for sumTotalTermFreq (all postings have freq of 1, since you omitted them).",

I will update tests across more sims such as LM and DFI that are sensitive to this to see any improvement. ",
