I believe that will cause it to show up in the Maven 1 repo as well.\n\nIt would be great if some nice Lucene person could take care of this.  Thanks in advance. ",

            "content": "To your question #1, the Maven people cannot track every release of every artifact across all open source organisations, which is basically what is maintained in the Maven repository. There used to be a mechanism whereby a PMC could request that their artifact be loaded into the repository; I'm not sure if that mechanism still exists, given that there is a local ASF repository that is automatically synced to the main Maven one.\n\nTo your question #2, Maven is a repository-based build system. It automatically downloads dependencies for a project based on the dependency information provided in the project's POM (Project Object Model). With Maven 2, it also automatically downloads transitive dependencies. This is an awesome improvement over other build systems such as Ant, which leaves you to manage your own dependecies. In order that Maven can locate and download the appropriate jar files, those jar files must be deployed to the Maven repository. It wouldn't be realistic to expect Maven to be able to locate and extract jar files from within a binary distribution, given that there is no standard way that these are packages and distributed. ",
