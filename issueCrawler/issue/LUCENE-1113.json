At search time, for retrieved documents, this method always \n   returns 1. This however does not mean that the boost value set at  indexing \n   time was ignored - it was just combined with other indexing time factors and \n   stored elsewhere, for better indexing and search performance. (For more \n   info see the \"norm(t,d)\" part of the scoring formula in \n   {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Similarity Similarity}.\n\n ",
