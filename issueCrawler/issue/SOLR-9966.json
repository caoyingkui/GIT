    "description": "In SOLR-9893 I disabled all tests on Java 9 that use EasyMock, because Easymock is not compatible with Java 9 (it uses outdated cglib version that does not work with Jigsaw module system). To me the project seems dead (no releases since more than 2 years).\n\nMockito latest version is compatible to Java 9 because it no longer uses cglib and the more modern and powerful Byte-Buddy lib; SOLR-9893 updated to it. \n\nI found this about more or less \"automated rewrite\" of EasyMock tests to Mockito:\n\n\thttps://wiki.magnolia-cms.com/display/DEV/Converting+Easymock-Tests+to+Mockito\n\tA script doing this: https://gist.github.com/stefanbirkner/1095194/904909cc229b6acb55c18f529e396089129e20e9\n\n\n\nIt is not many tests, so this would be a great cleanup:\n\n\n\tcore/src/test/org/apache/solr/cloud/ClusterStateTest.java\n\tcore/src/test/org/apache/solr/cloud/OverseerCollectionConfigSetProcessorTest.java\n\tcore/src/test/org/apache/solr/core/BlobRepositoryMockingTest.java\n\tcore/src/test/org/apache/solr/core/CoreSorterTest.java\n\tcore/src/test/org/apache/solr/security/TestPKIAuthenticationPlugin.java\n\tcore/src/test/org/apache/solr/servlet/SolrRequestParserTest.java\n\tsolrj/src/test/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/impl/CloudSolrClientCacheTest.java\n\n\n\nThere is one special case:\n\n\tcontrib/dataimporthandler/src/test/org/apache/solr/handler/dataimport/TestJdbcDataSource.java\n\n\n\nI am not sure how to convert this one, because it uses some strange system properties and a handler that intercepts some EasyMock stuff. I may need help to convert that one!\n\nAfter this is resolved we can remove the following dependencies from Solr:\n\n\tcglib-nodep\n\teasymock",

EasyMock will follow now that I'm aware of a problem.\n\nI'm expecting a release soon. I also don't think migrating worth the effort. You won't get much benefit.\n\nThat said, EasyMock is a nice framework and easy to dive in. It's perfect for someone you wants to get involved in a technical open source framework. And we are looking for help. Because indeed, right now, there is about one release a year (the last one was in September 2015. So not 2 years) ",

So based on statistics on Solr's Code Mockito is more used and EasyMock is only used with some legacy tests.\nTo fix the Java 9 problem, you have to first wait for a release of CGLIB.\nUwe ",

The class name is just there for display purposes, but you cannot load it. In fact this could also break with Java 8, if Mockito would implement injecting of mock classes different there (e.g. on IBM's JVM).\n\nSo this test should be removed or rewritten to not use class names and instead pass instances.
