    "description": "ResourceLoader#openResource() in this impl always returns null and ignores the ByteBuffer with data that it fetched before (it should warp it with an InputStream). If ResourceLoader#openResource is not supported, it should throw UOE, but returning \"null\" is against the contract! In addition, it does not ask the parent ResourceLoader first (like when finding classes).\n\nThis class is completely new to me, but looks like it's used with the plugin system. It should be fixed, as it might be passed as ResourceLoader around, leading to NPEs.\n\nAny comments what's wrong here?",
