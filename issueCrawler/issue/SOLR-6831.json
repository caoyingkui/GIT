    "description": "SOLR-5986 allows most queries to timeout cleanly using the ExitableDirectoryReader. In the case of facet pivots though, the exception is caught in SolrIndexSearcher's getDocSetNC while building pivots, resulting in numerous lookups, most of which failing, but overall still running for a long time and eating up resources. It should respect the timeAllowed just like any other request.",
