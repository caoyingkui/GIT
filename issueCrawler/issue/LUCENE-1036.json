    "description": "Since the upcoming 2.3 version of Lucene has support for the setRAMBufferSizeMB() method in Index Writer,  I thought I would test its performance.   So, using my application that was built upon (and worked with) Lucene 2.2,  I downloaded the nightly build 2007-10-26_03-16-46 and rebuilt my application with new code setting setRAMBufferSizeMB() from a properties file.   My test data resides in a database table of 30 columns holding 1.25 million records.   The good news is that performance is superior to Lucene 2.2.  The indexing completes in roughly 1/3 the time.   The bad news is the Index Writer.optimize() step now throws an java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.\nI also run tests against various other tables.  Indexing smaller amounts of data did not throw the exception.  Indexing largers amounts of data did throw the exception.  Note, I also tested nightly builds dating back to 2007-10-05.\n\n...\nINFO:  SEIndexThread.commitCheck...\nINFO:    ----Commit point reached:  1200000\nINFO:  SEIndexThread.commitCheck...\nINFO:    ----Commit point reached:  1225000\nINFO:  SEIndexThread.commitCheck...\nINFO:    ----Commit point reached:  1250000\nINFO:  SEIndexThread.closeIndex()...\nINFO:    ----commit point reached:  1250659\nINFO:    ----optimize index\nINFO: SEIndexThread():  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException\n        at java.lang.Thread.setPriority(Thread.java(Compiled Code))\n        at org.apache.lucene.index.ConcurrentMergeScheduler.merge(ConcurrentMerg\neScheduler.java(Compiled Code))\n        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.maybeMerge(IndexWriter.java:1750)\n        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.optimize(IndexWriter.java:1686)\n        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.optimize(IndexWriter.java:1652)\n        at LuceneSearchEngine.optimizeIndex(LuceneSearchEngine.java:643)\n        at LuceneSearchEngine.optimizeIndex(LuceneSearchEngine.java:636)\n        at SEIndexThread.closeIndex(SEIndexThread.java:674)\n        at SEIndexThread.processSearchObject(SEIndexThread.java:487)\n        at SEIndexThread.prepareIndex(SEIndexThread.java:391)\n        at SEIndexThread.run(SEIndexThread.java:41)",
