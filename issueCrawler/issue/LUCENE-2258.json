    "description": "The similarity method in FuzzyTermEnum is synchronized which is stupid because of:\n\n\tTermEnums are the iterator pattern and so are single-thread per definition\n\tThe method is private, so nobody could ever create a fake FuzzyTermEnum just to have this method and use it multithreaded.\n\tThe method is not static and has no static fields - so instances do not affect each other\n\n\n\nThe root of this comes from LUCENE-296, but was never reviewd and simply committed. The argument for making it synchronized is wrong.",
