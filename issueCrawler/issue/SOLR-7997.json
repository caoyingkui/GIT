            "content": "Attaching the book cover image scaled down to 150px width (the one previously attached here is much larger), and also an updated patch:\n\n\n\tAdded the new book cover to the set of six book covers on the front page of the Solr site, displacing the oldest book \"Einf\u00fchrung in Apache Solr\".\n\tRenamed book title anchor to include \"-II\" suffix to indicate that it's the second edition (using the same style as the book image name).\n\tFixed book cover anchor to remove the extra empty-tag-syntax slash: <a href=\"...\" /></a> -> <a href=\"...\"></a> - this was a problem on all the books, not just the new one, so I fixed them all.  (I'm guessing that people initially assumed that XML-style empty tag syntax <a/> would work, but when it didn't, they added the closing </a> tag but left the empty-tag-syntax slashhh in place since HTML browsers apparently are parsing leniently.)\n\n\n\nThe new book was published on 2015-04-27, so it's already properly positioned between \"Apache Solr Enterprise Search Server 3ed\" (published 2015-05-26) and \"Apache Solr Search Patterns\" (published 2015-04-26).\n\nCommitting and publishing shortly.
