The following issues need to be fixed if this should become part of \nLucene's core: \n\n-it doesn't work yet for fuzzy and range queries \n-it needs test cases (a real life test case that shows how this solves your \noriginal problem would be nice) \n-a better name is needed, maybe \"AnalyzingQueryParser\". But I'm not sure \nanyway whether it really should be a subclass or if it should be integrated \ninto QueryParser. \n-the \"we should never get here\" should probably throw a runtime exception for \neasier debugging \n\nIf you'd like to work on these issues that would be nice. \n ",

Analyzing is\nnot recommended when using a stemmer, since a stemmer usually truncates\nterms.\n\nFor multi-lingual content, I have used a custom analyzer which \"normalises\"\numlauts and diacritics to their closest ascii equivalent (see attachment\nbelow).\nDoing tests with StandardAnalyzer would not make much sense, so this test case\nrequires the custom analyzer as well.
