    "description": "With the introduction of the \"openSearcher=(true|false)\" option on commit & autocommit, there doesn't seem to be any way for external clients to know if the current searcher is the newest possible searcher available - ie: will \"commit=true&openSearcher=true\" (w/o any other changes) affect the results of queries?\n\nWe should probably add some way of determining this programmaticly (and via the Admin UI) as a stat to either the SolrCore or the individual \"searchers\".  Alternatively it might be enough to just report some piece of metadata about the commit point in the searcher and in the updateHandler that could be compared.",
