    "description": "The fix revision 499089 was aimed to remove an NPE bug (LUCENE-773) on the value  of  \"lockFactory \" in the method \"clearLock\" of the file \"/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/store/Directory.java\" , but it is incomplete. \n\nSince the value  \"lockFactory \" could be null during the runtime execution, its value should also be null-checked before being dereferenced in other methods. \n\nThe buggy code locations the same fix needs to be applied at are as bellows: \n\nLine 106 of the methods \"doc()\" , and \"freq\": \n\n          public Lock makeLock(String name) \n{\n[Line 106]      return lockFactory.makeLock(name);\n\n          }",
