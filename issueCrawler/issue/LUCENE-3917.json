            "content": "Recently at $DAYJOB the horror that is high frequency terms in OR search came to bite us, as a result I have an interest in pruning again.\n\nAs such I made an attempt to forward port the existing pruning package directly to Lucene 4.0.\n\nThis is largely a mechanical port, I have not put any real thought into it so its probably terrible.\n\nThis does not pass its unit test, and is a mess internally in the code, I am going to try to get the unit test working and then loop back on making the code more lucene 4.x friendly.\n\nOne question that occurs from this is how AtomicReaders are handled, do we want to pruning per segment with global stats, prune based on segment stats or just do the terrible thing and work with a SlowCompositeReader.\n\nI also think, given the work that went on with LUCENE-4752 it might be possible to do the pruning in a similar fashion to the sorting merge such that we do a pruning merge.
