    "description": "I appears that all methods in OpenNLPOpsFactory which use a ResourceLoader to get an InputStream to use for building a model are not closing those InputStreams\n\nThis doesn't seem to negatively affect any existing lucene/analysis/opennlp tests, because the JVM doesn't know/care that there is a filehandle still open at the end of the test (is there a way to make the test complain?)  but it does seem to cause a Solr level test failure on windows (SOLR-12046) because the solr tests create a temp dir where pre-built models are copied for use, and when the test completes the cleanup attempts to delete those copies of the files but windows won't let it because they are still open.\n\npresumably if a lucene/analysis/opennlp test also made a copy of the files a similar failure would be triggered \u2013 but only on windows",
