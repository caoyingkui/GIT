    "description": "This is similar to what SOLR-9548 did for all modes, but only applies to cloud mode.\n\nOn startup, the precise information that will be used when registering the node in zookeeper should be logged before the registration happens.  This info includes (but might not be limited to) host, port, context path, and protocol, which will be http or https.  This will make it easier to troubleshoot problems with the mechanism that determines the node name/address for registration.",
