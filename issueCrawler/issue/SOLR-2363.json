I distinctly remember having this confusion, and I've seen it go round multiple times on the user's list. Interestingly, I can't find anything on the Wiki where \"qt=dismax\" is in the text..\n\nbq:  I would suggest we have a qt=dismax that is plain vanilla,\n\nPlease no! The whole point is to avoid the confusion over qt=dismax and defType=dismax. \n "

It's where most people start learning about Solr, request handlers and the like - thus it should not be confusing, but rather have super-clear comments helping the user get going.\n\nAlso, per definition, changing this in the example schema will not break anything anywhere \n\n&qt=robust or &qt=userfriendly or &qt=onesearchbox could be other alternatives?
