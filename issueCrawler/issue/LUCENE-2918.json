    "description": "We now prune 100% deleted segs on commit from IW or IR (LUCENE-2010),\nbut this isn't quite aggressive enough, because in the NRT case you\nrarely call commit.\n\nInstead, the moment we delete the last doc of a segment, it should be\npruned from the in-memory segmentInfos.  This way, if you open an NRT\nreader, or a merge kicks off, or commit is called, the 100% deleted\nsegment is already gone.",
