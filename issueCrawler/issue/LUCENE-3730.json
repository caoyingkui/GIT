Search segmentation tests/examples are in search-segmentation-tests.txt and is validated by TestSearchMode.\n\nNote that both the tests and the heuristic is tuned for IPADIC.  Hence, we need to revisit this when we add support for other dictionaries/models.\n\nI've also moved the ASF license header in TestExtendedMode.java to the right place. ",

Hence, we need to revisit this when we add support for other dictionaries/models.\n\nI think this is ok for now. \nLong term (if there end out being different values for other dictionaries), we can conditionalize these on dictionary type:\neither at build-time (recording these values into dictionary), or better, record the dictionary type itself and conditionalize\nthese at run-time based on dictionary type.\n\nBy recording the type, we would also be able to use e.g. assumeTrue(dictionaryType == IPADIC) in unit tests and things like that,\nand who knows what else, but lets not worry about it here.
