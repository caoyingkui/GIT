    "description": "Solr can end up printing a lot of these objects via the JmxMonitoriedMap, see SOLR-8869 and SOLR-6747 as examples.\n\nFrom looking at some profiles, a lot of time and memory are spent resizing the StringBuilder, which doesn't set the initial capacity.\n\nOn my cluster, the strings are a bit over 200 chars; I set the initial capacity to 250 and ran tests calling toString 1000 times.  Tests consistently show 10-15% improvement when setting the initial capacity.",
