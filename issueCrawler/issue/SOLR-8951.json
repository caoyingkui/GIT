Allow user to specify a new parameter authenticationProvider in security.json which determines the authentication provider with .

It must contain a JSON object with mandatory property \"class\"\n\tFallback to Sha256AuthProv as before\n\n\n\nWrt. editing API, have not tested changing provider using set-property, but it should work. Perhaps it is better to introduce a new command set-provider for this? ",
