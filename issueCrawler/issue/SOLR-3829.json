    "description": "The Solr Admin page does not show any log events. There are Javascript errors\n\n\nTypeError: doc.logger.esc is not a function\n... '<abbr title=\"' + doc.logger.esc() + '\">' + doc.logger.split( '.' ).pop().esc()...\n\n\n\nThis is because the response of the LoggingHandler added unexpected [ ... ] characters around the values for time, level, logger and message:\n\n\n...\n\"history\":{\"numFound\":2,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[{\"time\":[\"2012-09-11T15:07:05.453Z\"],\"level\":[\"WARNING\"],\"logger\":[\"org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore\"],\"message\":[\"New index directory detected: ...\n\n\n\nThis is caused by the way the JSON is created. org.apache.solr.logging.LogWatcher#toSolrDocument creates a SolrDocument which is then formatted with a org.apache.solr.response.JSONResponseWriter.\nBut the JSONResponseWriter uses the index schema to decide how to format the JSON. We have the following field declaration in schema.xml:\n\n\n    <dynamicField name=\"*\" type=\"ignored\" />\n\n\n\nThe field type \"ignored\" has the attribute multiValued set to true. Because of this JSONResponseWriter adds [] characters in org.apache.solr.response.JSONWriter#writeSolrDocument\n\nThe formatting should be independent from schema.xml",
