I've also done quite a bit of manual testing with the new functions and they look pretty good.\n\nThe one thing to keep in mind with setValue() is that due to various internal details the easiest implementation avoids side effects. This means that each call to setValue() results in a new tuple (shallow copy of the tuple) rather then a change to the original tuple.\u00a0 ",
