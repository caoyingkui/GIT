    "description": "Currently in the contrib there is FloatLatLng, and FixedLatLng, which both extend LatLng.  The reason for this separation is not clear and is not needed in the current functionality.  The functionality that is used can be collapsed into LatLng, which can be made a concrete class.  Internally LatLng can benefit from the improvements suggested in LUCENE-1934.\n\nLLRect, which uses LatLng, can also be simplified by removing the unused functionality, and using the new LatLng class.\n\nAll classes can be improved through documentation, some method renaming, and general code tidy up.",
