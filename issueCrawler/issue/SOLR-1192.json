    "description": "If a field is split in tokens (by a tokenizer) and after that is aplied the NGramFilterFactory for these tokens...the indexing goes well while the length of the tokens is greater or equal with minim ngram size (ussually is 3). Otherwise the indexing breaks in this point and the rest of tokens  are no more indexed. This behaviour can be easy observed with the analysis tool which is in Solr admin interface.",
