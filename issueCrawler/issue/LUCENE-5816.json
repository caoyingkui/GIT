    "description": "For now ToParentBlockJoinQuery accepts only child\ndocuments. Before (LUCENE-4968) passing parent document to TPBJQ lead to\nundefined behavior and garbage in results, unfortunately it also affects\nTPBJQ.advance().  After pointed patch IllegalStateException is\nthrown when this occurs.\n\nSo we must always take parent-child relations into account while writing\nqueries. At most of time it is necessary when writing a query, but sometimes,\nfilters can be independent of data model (for example, ACL filters:\n+TPBJQ +allowed:user).\n\nTPBJQ shall returns parent doc if parent doc is passed to TPBJQ.advance()\nor returned from childScorer.advance(). This change doesn't break anything:\nresults will be absolutely the same for parent-child orthogonal queries.\n\nIn few words: Document matching parent filter should be parent of itself.",
