I'll backport to 2.3.2 as well.\n\nLUCENE-1253 is one example where Lucene's core analyzers could do this.",

I plan to commit in a day or two.\n\nI also noticed that CheckIndex would incorrectly mark an index as corrupt if two sequential positions are the same, which of course is perfectly fine (eg if you are injecting synonyms with positionIncrementGap=0).  So I fixed that case too. ",

            "content": "FWIW: Apparently Luke gets confused by this as well.\n\nif i'm understanding correctly, the only reason position \"-1\" seems to come about is because of some internal counter that starts at \"-1\" since it assumes the first token will have an increment of \"1\" and thus: the first position used is \"0\"\n\nChanging IndexWriter/DocumentsWriter/whatever to ignore the increment of the first Token, or make it realitve to \"0\" might be a better solution in general.\n\ncases to consider: what should it mean for position info if:\n\n\n\tfirst token has increment of 0\n\tfirst token has increment of 1\n\tfirst token has increment of 27\n\n\n\nin my opinion, the answers should probably be: 0, 1, 27 ... but i think that changes the common case of \"1\" (which would currently gets a position of \"0\" right?) ... so maybe the right behavior is 0,0,26\n ",

So shouldn't the first token be at position=0 no matter what its increment?\n\nI'm ok with that ... but the other way to look at it is that there is a \"virtual token\" signifing the start of the Field, and the first physical tokens increment is relative that ... with things like SpanFirstQueries not allowing the \"first\" token to specify an arbitrary increment from the 'virtual\" start of the field has real consequences.\n\n(consider an Analyzer that only indexes proper names and wants to record real positions so that a SpanFirstQuery can find docs where Doug Cutting appears in the first 100 Tokens) ",
