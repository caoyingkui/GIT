    "description": "If IndexFetcher customization is required, right now one needs to fork both IndexFetcher and ReplicationHandler with a lot of duplication to make this happen. \n\nFor a first pass, customizing ReplicationHandler to have a different IndexFetcher should be easily possible (and from a different package). In addition, an implementation of IndexFetcher that can override fetching should be possible.  \n\nAs a second pass, ideally fetchLatestIndex can be broken up into smaller components for both readability and extensibility.",
