    "description": "The plist Streaming Expression wraps any number of streaming expressions and opens them in parallel. The results of each of the streams are then iterated in the order they appear in the list. Since many streams perform heavy pushed down operations when opened, like the FacetStream, this will result in the parallelization of these operations. For example plist could wrap several facet() expressions and open them each in parallel, which would cause the facets to be run in parallel, on different replicas in the cluster. Here is sample syntax:\n\nplist(tuple(facet1=facet(...)), \n      tuple(facet2=facet(...)),\n      tuple(facet3=facet(...)))",

            "content": "New patch with updates to the ListStream and TupStream to support goals of the ticket. The TupStream now reads its internal streams into memory in the open method. This allows the TupStream to be parallelized effectively by the ParallelListStream. This is important because the TupStream can be used to partition the output of the ParallelStream rather then simply concatenating streams. ",
