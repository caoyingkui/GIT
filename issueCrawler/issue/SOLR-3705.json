            "content": "Can you describe what behavior you sould expect if hl.alternateField supported globs? .. i honestly don't understand what that would even mean functionally.\n\nthe use of hl.alternateField is to specify field used to provide a literal value when a snippet can not be generated for an hl.fl field.\n\nSo using the solr example data, a request like this...\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=video&hl=true&fl=id&hl.fl=name&hl.fl=manu&hl.alternateField=id\n\nwould cause docs that can't generate snippets against either the manu or video field to use the full value of the \"id\" field instead (it's a contrived example, but you get the idea)\n\nfurthermore, hl.alternateField supports per field overrides, so you can use something like this to specify exactly what field value to use as a fallback when no snippets can be created for a field...\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=video&hl=true&fl=id&hl.fl=name&hl.fl=manu&f.name.hl.alternateField=name&f.manu.hl.alternateField=manu\n\n...you can even use these per field overrides in combination with globs in hl.fl...\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=video&hl=true&fl=id&hl.fl=*&f.name.hl.alternateField=name&f.manu.hl.alternateField=manu\n\n...so that if a field produces a snippet, that snippet will be used, and if specificly picked fields (name and manu in this example) don't produce snippets, they will still be included explicitly.\n\nBut i have no idea what you would expect to happen if you tried to something like...\n\n\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=video&hl=true&fl=id&hl.fl=*&hl.alternateField=*\n\thttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=video&hl=true&fl=id&hl.fl=foo_*&f.foo_yak.hl.alternateField=foo_bar_*&hl.alternateField=summary\n\n\n\n?

            "content": "I took me a while to get back to this. The problem is that we have over 20 full text fields per document of which only one contains the text, they're all language specific fields like content_en, content_de etc. We use hl.fl=content_* to get highlighted snippets for whatever field is matched by the main query. But a document can also be matched on a non-content field so the highlighter won't find a snippet for the content field. We though that if we could glob the alternate field as well, it would be a simple mechanism to get a snippet from an alternate field that is any of the content_* fields. "
