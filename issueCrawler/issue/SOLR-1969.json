    "description": "This will make it so you can enable mmapdirectory from the solrconfig.xml file. There are also several configurations you can specify in the solrconfig.xml file. You can enable or disable the unmapping files which have been closed by solr. This is almost necessary for an index which is being optimized. You also have the option to not mmap certain files. In this case, FSDirectory will be used to manage those particular files. This is particularly useful if you are using FieldCache (SOLR-1961). Having this enabled makes it useless to memory map the .fdt and .fdx files, considering they are already in memory.\n\nThe configurations are specified as follows:\n\n<directoryFactory class=\"solr.MMapDirectoryFactory\">\n    <str name=\"unmap\">true</str>\n    <lst name=\"filetypes\">\n      <bool name=\"fdt\">false</bool>\n      <bool name=\"fdx\">false</bool>\n    </lst>\n  </directoryFactory>\n\nThis would enable unmapping of closed files and would not memory map files ending with .fdt and .fdx.",

It's static but not used anywhere in the code. And why it is wrapped into an ArrayList at all? it does not need to be modified, so the resulting List from Arrays.asList is fair enough. You can reduce the whole patch to a class with a maximum of about 10 lines of code.\n\nAnd yes, there is a list of extensions in Lucene (but unfortunately not in trunk, as trunk can have very different file extensions as it uses flex. The list is only available through the used codec when you open the index)!\n\nPlease upload patches as .patch files, this makes it easier to review as they open in patch viewer outside of browser. "
