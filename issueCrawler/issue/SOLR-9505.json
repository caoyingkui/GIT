    "description": "The behaviour of the Atomic Update remove operation in the code doesn't match the description in the Confluence documentation, which has been questioned already. From looking at the source code, and using curl to confirm, the remove operation only removes the first occurrence of a value from a multi-valued field, it does not remove all occurrences. The removeregex operation does remove all, however.\n\nThere are unit tests for Atomic Updates, but they didn't assert this behaviour, so I've added some extra assertions to confirm that, and a couple of extra tests including one that checks that removeregex does a Regex match of the whole value, not just a find-anywhere operation.\n\nI think it's the documentation that needs clarifying - the code behaves as expected (assuming remove was intended to work that way?)",
