    "description": "DocBasedVersionConstraintsProcessor supports allowing document updates only if the new version is greater than the old. However, if any behavior wants to be extended / changed in minor ways, the entire class will need to be copied and slightly modified rather than extending and changing the method in question. \n\nIt would be nice if DocBasedVersionConstraintsProcessor stood on its own as a non-private class. In addition, certain methods (such as pieces of isVersionNewEnough) should be broken out into separate methods so they can be extended such that someone can extend the processor class and override what it means for a new version to be accepted (allowing equal versions through? What if new is a lower not greater number?).",

Perhaps you were toying with some refactoring to this method and backed out.\n\nI'm not sure what methods should be protected vs private but I can tell when you were deliberate about it, and those places make sense to me.\n\nAlthough likely out of scope, FYI increasingly URPs are allowing a parameter based configuration and then auto-register it such that you needn't have to touch your configuration to use it.  See TemplateUpdateProcessorFactory and UUIDUpdateProcessorFactory for what I mean. ",

The case we have is a document has multiple version fields - it wouldn't simply be enough to have n DocBasedVersionConstraintsProcessors, where n is the number of versions, unless there was a version of the processor (which can now be accomplished by subclassing and overriding versionInUpdateIsAcceptable) that accepted greater than or equal numbers and passed them along until the last one, which was only greater than.

Split versionField by comma is the alternative I suggest.  It's simpler to implement, simpler to understand the parameters this URP takes (1 required versus an XOR between 2).  It just takes a white lie that \"versionField\" is singular when in fact it could be multiple.  I think it's not a big deal considering the need for more than one is uncommon.  That's all... I'm not particularly opinionated about this so if you'd rather keep how you've already coded it now then fine.\n\nunless there was a version of the processor (which can now be accomplished by subclassing and overriding versionInUpdateIsAcceptable) that accepted greater than or equal numbers and passed them along until the last one\n\nI don't have an opinion because I haven't thought through what you say admittedly; I just want to allow this URP to be more subclass-able to allow more customization.  You've thought through this and I trust your judgement.\n ",
