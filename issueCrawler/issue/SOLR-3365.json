It also seems like adding this flexibility could take a good chunk out of DIH's locale-sensitivity problems.\n\nIt seems as if we need to let users define property writers that save whatever information needed about the last import to support the next import.  Possibly a new data-config.xml section that lets users specify/configure DIHPropertiesWriter impls to use with each entity in their config. "
