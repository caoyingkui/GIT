    "description": "BooleanWeight.explain() uses the returned score of subweights to determine if a clause matched.\nIf any required clause has boost==0, the returned score will be zero and the explain for the entire BooleanWeight will be simply  Explanation(0.0f, \"match required\").\n\nI'm not sure what the correct fix is here.  I don't think it can be done based on score alone, since that isn't how scorers work.   Perhaps we need a new method \"boolean Explain.matched()\" that returns true on a match, regardless of what the score may be? \n\nRelated to the problem above, even if no boosts are zero, it it sometimes nice to know why a particular query failed to match.  It would mean a longer explanation, but maybe we should include non matching explains too?",
