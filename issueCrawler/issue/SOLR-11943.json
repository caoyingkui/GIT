    "description": "This ticket will add the following functions / features:\n\n1) latlonVectors function: Reads a list of tuples that contain a location\u00a0field type\u00a0 of lat, lon pairs and returns a matrix\u00a0of lat,lon vectors.\u00a0\n\n2) Add support for haversinMeters\u00a0distance measure.\n\nWith the addition of these two functions we'll have the ability to do various distance based machine learning algorithms (distance matrices, clustering, knn regression etc...) with location data.",
