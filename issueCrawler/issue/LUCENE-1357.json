            "content": "Well this is annoying - the test for this counted on the setting being on - which was what the bug was - the setting was always on. But the fix is not so simple - the setting actually needs to be set before the constructor. I don't like the lazy load option for a few reasons, and that leaves dropping the setter, getter and adding new constructors (there are already too many), or just making the accessor methods static and docing so that users know to call the setter first and that its a global setting.  I am leaning towards making the methods static and global as the best option with the least amount of changes. ",
