    "description": "1) ReferenceManager.doMaybeRefresh seems to call afterRefresh even if it didn't refresh/swap, (when newReference == null)\n\n2) It would be nice if users were allowed to override SearcherManager.afterRefresh() to get notified when a new searcher is in action.\n\nBut SearcherManager and ReaderManager are final, while NRTManager is not.\n\n\nThe only way to currently hook into when a new searched is created is using the factory, but if you wish to do some async task then, there are no guarantees that acquire() will return the new searcher, so you have to pass it around and incRef manually. While if allowed to hook into afterRefresh you can just rely on acquire()  & existing infra you have around it to give you the latest one.",

Maybe we make SM non-final and advertise that this is for afterRefresh...?  Or, app passes in a separate \"OnRefresh\" callback interface...? ",

Good catch !\n\nWhat branch/trunk does this patch apply to?\n\nFew comments about the patch:\n\n\n\tWhy do you need both afterRefresh() and afterMaybeRefresh()? Is it because NRTManager tests failures, or was there a different reason?\n\tWhy did you add the same test to both NRTManager and SearcherManager tests? Isn't it enough to test it once on e.g. a dummy ReferenceManager extension? The test only verifies that the listeners are called.\n\tShould Listener be renamed to RefreshListener?\n\tNow that you have the listener, is there a reason for a protected afterRefresh() and afterMaybeRefresh()? Aren't the listeners enough?\n\t\n\t\tOn that note, I kinda like the listeners approach, so maybe we should add a RefreshListener and CloseListener and get rid of the protected methods? The listeners also allow us to keep the classes final, yet still have some sort of extension point.\n\t\n\t\n\tIs it really necessary to use CopyOnWriteArrayList? Do we really expect an application will install a listener after the manager has already started and serviced calls?\n\t\n\t\tIt seems like a setup method to me, and I'm fine if we document that you should call these methods before any other method of the class is called.\n\t\n\t\n\n ",

            "content": "against trunk r1411996\n\n* Why do you need both afterRefresh() and afterMaybeRefresh()? Is it because NRTManager tests failures, or was there a different reason?\n\nYes only reason, not very clean , not sure if NRT actually needs to be able to call something after every maybeRefresh or if its a test/impl restriction (probably latter?)\n\n* Why did you add the same test to both NRTManager and SearcherManager tests? Isn't it enough to test it once on e.g. a dummy ReferenceManager extension? The test only verifies that the listeners are called.\n\nTrue but there wasn't an existing ReferenceManager test, and it verifies they both call super.* in the override, but as stated in one of your next points, this can be done differently if the classes should be final.\n\n\n* Should Listener be renamed to RefreshListener?\n\nThought of that aswel, but then it felt strange to have the afterClose in there too.\n\n* Now that you have the listener, is there a reason for a protected afterRefresh() and afterMaybeRefresh()? Aren't the listeners enough?\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOn that note, I kinda like the listeners approach, so maybe we should add a RefreshListener and CloseListener and get rid of the protected methods?

Other option is maybe to piggy back on the refresh lock in the setter maybe. Or just document it as you say\n ",
