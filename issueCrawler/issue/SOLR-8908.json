    "description": "As discovered by Alexey Serba, each ZkIndexSchemaReader registers as an OnReconnect listener with the ZkController to get notified when the ZK Session has been re-established. However, the ZkIndexSchemaReader is never removed from the reconnectListeners list in ZkController when the core is reloaded or removed. \n\nMoreover, it also means that the same core is re-notified of the re-connect more than once if it has been reloaded.\n\nThis leads to a memory leak, which can become a real issue if you have a lot of cores or do a lot of reloads of your cores.",
