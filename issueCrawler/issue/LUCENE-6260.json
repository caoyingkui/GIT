    "description": "ExactPhraseScorer tries to intersect positions using windows of 4096 documents. In LUCENE-2410 it was reported that it helped a lot but I tried again on wikibig with a simpler impl that does advance one position at a time and the performance difference was only of a few percents. I'm guessing that maybe other changes (eg. the new postings format?) do not make this behaviour as useful as it used to be?",
