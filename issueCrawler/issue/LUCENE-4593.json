    "description": "I was looking at James patch for LUCENE-3298, and I thought that you know, FST almost abstracts its underlying \"i/o\" (storage) via reader/writer abstractions.\n\nIt would be good to try to work on this more, e.g. we can imagine a little abstraction like lucene has a Store (Directory). \n\nThis way maybe we could cleanup the packed vs non-packed, allow for > 2GB fsts without slowing down small ones, and so on.\n\nI have a patch that is like an amoeba-step towards this",

            "content": "+1, this is a good amoeba step!\n\nI think this would be a useful abstraction.\n\nEg maybe we could write directly to disk ... or, improve the RAM buffering to use growing/appending/paged buffers instead of one massive byte[] (which causes huge RAM spikes when we do ArrayUtil.grow) ... actually once we fix RAMFile it could just use that.
