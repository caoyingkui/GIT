            "content": "The patch should be source and binary compatible with Lucene clients, as the modified classes are not visible outside Lucene's code. ConstantScoreQuery$ConstantBulkScorer is protected, but the outer class is final. JaspellTernarySearchTrie$TSTNode is protected final. The remaining nested classes are private, package-local or test.\nThere's a number of public classes with modified signatures in Solr. I'm not sure if I their signatures can be changed, if not, I may need to remove them from patch.\nThere are a few more classes that could be made static after LUCENE-7753 is implemented. ",
