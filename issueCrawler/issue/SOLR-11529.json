    "description": "Properties set in the config overlay (configoverlay.json) are not working in the dataimport config, but they DO work in solrconfig.xml.\n\nA user in IRC reported the issue, and I duplicated it.  I set up a cloud example, then adjusted the config and jars so that it would allow setting up a DIH handler.  I did not add any JDBC driver jars.\n\nOne of the properties added with the config API was \"solr.db.driver\" with a value of \"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\".  I modified the LTR transformer already in the config to use ${solr.db.driver} for the class.  That resulted in an error message, and the error said that it couldn't load com.mysql.jdbc.Driver ... so I knew that the property substitution had worked.\n\nThen I tried to use the same property inside the dih-config.xml file referenced by the DIH handler.  This also failed, but didn't mention the mysql driver class.  So I modified the class to ${solr.db.driver}.foo, which resulted in the following error:\n\n\nFull Import failed:java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.DataImportHandlerException: Could not load driver: .foo Processing Document # 1\n\n\n\nThis tells me that the properties were not loaded when DIH parsed its config.",
