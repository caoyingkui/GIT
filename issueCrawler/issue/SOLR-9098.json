    "description": "When our schema is not mutable (for whatever reason) the only way to get that information is to try a change and see if it fails, like this:\n\n\n$ curl -i localhost:8983/solr/dummy/schema -d '{ \"add-field\":{ \"name\":\"sell-by\", \"type\":\"tdate\", \"stored\":true } }'\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 112\n\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":5\n  },\n  \"errors\":[\n    {\n      \"errorMessages\":\"schema is not editable\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nthis message is caused by SchemaManager#performOperations which checks if schema instanceof ManagedIndexSchema && schema.isMutable() - we could include that information in the response for /schema and allow users to see upfront if they could modify the schema or rather not.\n\nSteve Rowe i'm not entirely sure that i didn't miss any tests related to the schema handler, would you mind having a look?",

            "content": "Thanks for mentioning that Steve! Further checking revealed, that the schema page already does the following request:\n\n\nConfig.get({core: $routeParams.core}, function(data) {\n    $scope.isSchemaUpdatable = (data.config.hasOwnProperty('schemaFactory') == false || data.config.schemaFactory.class == \"ManagedIndexSchemaFactory\");\n});\n\n\nlooking at it, i was following to SOLR-8386 - so i'd say somewhere in the past, it was already there and probably got lost again?\n\nReading through ManagedIndexSchemaFactory i got the impression that it's not entirely impossible to have a immutable schema while using it - which would imply that we'd need another check, instead of just checking for the class in use. or am i mistaken here?
