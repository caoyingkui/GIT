I think this is negligable. ",

            "content": "Hi Steven,\nI was out of office when you committed this. I don't understand the reason why you add the JAR build to every contrib now? Would it be not enough to just extend \"init\" target in the demo contrib? This is easy possible (to override targets imported before using a \"super.\" like construct). I spent a lot of time to remove the unneeded jar builds in Lucene contrib about one year ago, on my laptop the build now takes lot longer. All contrib builds are never using any jar file, their classpath's always use the file system folders during compiling and testing. This speeds up the build enormous (before my changes in up-to-date, every dependent contrib was always compiled as JAR). So contrib/demo is the only one that needs the JAR. ",
