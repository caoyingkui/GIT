And the other two warnings would stay for now.\n\nChristine Poerschke: I haven't looked closely at the other two to know when they are safe to remove \u2013 i just noticed that removingthe mergePolicy warning was weird since hte functionality itself doesn't seem to have been removed.\n\nto be clear: the call to assertWarnOrFail should be removed many versions AFTER the functionality is removed \u2013 the only change should be in the final argument to the call, so that instead of logging a warning \"don't do X use Y instead\" it triggers a hard failure with the message \"don't do X use Y instead\"\n\n\n\nThe method was designed so that the final boolean \"failCondition\" could be something conditional \u2013 like comparing some constant with the Version.LATEST (of the luceneMatchVersion from the users config) \u2013 so that you could write a single line of code on master, backport it to a stable branch, and get a \"fail\" on master but a \"warn\" on older branches (or better: a warn if their luceneMatchVersion < X, but when they edit or replace their config and use a newer luceneMatchVersion the warning becomes a fail) ... then we don't have to go out of our way to remember when it's safe to remove an assertWarnOrFail method call \u2013 we just remove it completley once whatever Version constants it refers to are removed (ie: 6.6 removed in 8.0)\n ",
