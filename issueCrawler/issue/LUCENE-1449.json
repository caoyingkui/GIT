            "content": "Sneaky!\n\nThere is indeed a bug here, but once we fix it, you won't be able to\ndo rollback by opening the latest commit point.\n\nBut, LUCENE-1411 (recently committed to 2.9) will work: it lets you\nopen IndexWriter on an arbitrary commit point.\n\nYour deletion policy then gets to decide what to do with the now\nfuture commit points (ie, you can keep them around), and when you next\ncommit, it's written to the segments_N after all future commit points.\nIe, it's like using svn to revert a bunch of changes: the changes\nstill live in prior commit points; it's just that your next commit has\nremoved those changes.\n\nConceptually, when IndexWriter opens and loads a commit point, either\none you explicitly specified, or, the most recent one by default, it\nholds open a private in-memory-only commit point which you can't\ndelete.  You can delete the commit points on disk, but the one in\nmemory is private to IndexWriter and moves forward as segments are\nflushed, merged, etc.  When IndexWriter commits, it makes a new\non-disk commit point that's a copy of the in-memory one.\n\nThis bug is happening because when IndexWriter commits (during close),\nit thinks there are no pending changes and so does nothing.  But,\nthere was a change (you removed the last commit point), and so I think\nwe should mark doing so as a real change.  What this will mean is\nIndexWriter will simply write the next segments_N file which is a copy\nof the one you had just deleted. ",
