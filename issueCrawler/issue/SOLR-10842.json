    "description": "The Solr Quick Start at https://lucene.apache.org/solr/quickstart.html has been problematic to keep up to date - until Ishan just updated it yesterday for 6.6, it said \"6.2.1\", so hadn't been updated for several releases.\n\nNow that the Ref Guide is in AsciiDoc format, we can easily use variables for package versions, and it could be released as part of the Ref Guide and kept up to date. It could also integrate links to more information on topics, and users would already be IN the docs, so they would not need to wonder where the docs are.\n\nThere are a few places on the site that will need to be updated to point to the new location, but I can also put a redirect rule into .htaccess so people are redirected to the new location if there are other links \"in the wild\" that we cannot control. This allows it to be versioned also, if that becomes necessary.\n\nAs part of this, I would like to also update the entire \"Getting Started\" section of the Ref Guide, which is effectively identical to what was in the first release of the Ref Guide back in 2009 for Solr 1.4 and is in serious need of reconsideration.\n\nMy thought is that moving the page + redoing the Getting Started section would be for 7.0, but if folks are excited about this idea I could move the page for 6.6 and hold off redoing the larger section until 7.0.",

The much bigger problem is that the primary indexing example that most of the later query examples depend on is no longer possible (SOLR-10862). That has a much deeper impact throughout.\n\nI likely need some help figuring out how to replace that example. I tried to replace it with a simple web crawl using post.jar, but it's not working. I also think that's problematic - users may think post.jar is a crawler, which would be incorrect, and if they don't have internet access they're stuck. The other exampledocs are relatively light - it's a possibility, but would be nice to have something more robust.\n\nThere is a nice set of example docs in example/films, but the README there says the user should explicitly set up a few fields in the schema before indexing them, which is also not ideal for the very first step of a \"quick start\". The changes in SOLR-9526 may in fact help that - I'll try it and see if that can be used instead without any manual field manipulation by users. ",

            "content": "I've made a lot of new changes, and to make review easier all around, I pushed the branch I've been working on to jira/solr-10842.\n\nI redesigned the tutorial (and renamed it from \"Quick Start\" to \"Tutorial\") so it now follows a 3-exercise plan that takes the user through some steps and educates him/her along the way about a few things:\n\n\n\tExercise 1 shows how to use bin/solr to launch Solr in cloud mode, index some data and do some queries. It takes the user through the full interactive session so the sample_techproducts_configs can be used, explaining each step along the way. The user then indexes the techproducts data with bin/post and runs a few types of searches (simple keyword, fielded search, phrase search).\n\tExercise 2 shows how to create another collection, index the films sample data, and work with facets. The collection in this exercise uses the _default configset. It explains the limitations of schemaless, and exposes them to using the Schema API to manually create a field and a copyField so the films data is properly indexed. Then the user works with facets - simple facets, date range facets, then pivot facets.\n\tExercise 3 isn't much of an exercise, really, but an encouragement for the user to index a local set of data, taking into consideration any schema needs, etc. It points to using bin/post for \"rich\" files like PDFs, Word, etc., or DIH, or SolrJ, or the Documents Screen in the UI. It asks the user to start thinking about their needs for implementation.\n\n\n\nThis is probably mostly there, but the Windows coverage is relatively spotty. Some actions have Windows corollary commands, but most don't. I forget how to use Windows entirely, so would appreciate some assistance there. There may also be typos, etc., that need to be fixed. Since it's on a branch, submissions are welcome.\n\nStill TODO are to rename the \"Upgrading Solr Page\" as I mentioned in earlier comments, and possibly rename \"Getting Started\". \n\nThis is holding me up from a couple other things needed for 7.0 Ref Guide (like upgrading info), so I hope to commit these changes as soon as I finish those items and do a couple more read-throughs (by the end of the week maybe?).

I tried to change the reference in solr/site/index.xsl to point to where the tutorial will be in production, but that fails the link checker since according to it, that file doesn't exist (it's not wrong in its own context).\n\nSo, we can't have a hard-link using lucene.apache.org and we can't use a relative link that we know works. \n\nThe only solution I know of right now is to remove solr/site/quickstart.mdtext and remove any link to the tutorial from solr/site/index.xsl.
