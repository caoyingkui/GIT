    "description": "POST to /schema/dynamicfields will add one or more new dynamic fields to the schema.\n\nPUT to /schema/dynamicfields/name will add the name'd dynamic field to the schema.\n\nLike the copyField support added to the /schema/fields REST API by SOLR-5010, it will be possible to specify copyField destinations at the point of dynamic field creation.\n\nThe implementation will follow the /schema/fields REST API implementation fairly closely, with the additional restriction that the field name must follow the dynamic field name restrictions, i.e.: 1) exactly one asterisk must be present in the name; and 2) the asterisk must be the first and/or the last character of the name (first and last only if the asterisk is the entire name).",

            "content": "Patch, I think it's ready to go.\n\nThe patch also included a performance fix to ManagedIndexSchema.addFields(), to only persist the schema once for all added fields, rather than once per field.\n\nTimothy Potter, I've made some fairly radical changes to TestCloudManagedSchemaConcurrent (to simplify addition of new Schema API functionality), which will very likely clash with your changes there on SOLR-5098, so we'll need to do a merge at some point.
