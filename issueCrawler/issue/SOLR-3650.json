    "description": "There was discussion a long while back about eliminating the plethora of CHANGES.txt files in various lucene contribs/modules and consolidating into lucene/CHANGES.txt to prevent \"hiding\" things from users who may not know/think/remember to check each of the individual contirbs/modules.\n\nthis is long done and dealt with under \"lucene/\", but on the \"solr/\" side we still have a multitude of CHANGES.txt files in contribs that are inconsistently used to record features/fixes in those contribs (frequently they get listed in solr/CHANGES.txt instead)\n\nWe should eliminate these contrib/*/CHANGES.txt files completely, and merge all of the existing items in them into the apropriate version & section of solr/CHANGES.txt\n\n\nhossman@frisbee:~/lucene/dev$ find -name CHANGES.txt\n./solr/CHANGES.txt\n./solr/contrib/langid/CHANGES.txt\n./solr/contrib/dataimporthandler/CHANGES.txt\n./solr/contrib/clustering/CHANGES.txt\n./solr/contrib/extraction/CHANGES.txt\n./solr/contrib/uima/CHANGES.txt\n./solr/contrib/analysis-extras/CHANGES.txt\n./lucene/CHANGES.txt",
