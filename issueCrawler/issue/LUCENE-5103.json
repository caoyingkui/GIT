    "description": "TermsIncludingScoreQuery has an inner class SVInnerScorer used when the \"to\" side of a join is single-valued.  This has a nextDocOutOfOrder() method that is faulty when there are deleted documents, and a document that is deleted is matched by the join.  It'll terminate with NO_MORE_DOCS prematurely.  Interestingly, it appears MVInnerScorer (multi-valued) was coded properly to not have this problem.",
