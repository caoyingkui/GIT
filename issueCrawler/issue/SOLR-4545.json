    "description": "The replication handler has a \"backup\" command which creates snapshots in the data directory.  Oddly, there is no way to rollback to a backup.  You could do some awkward index moving and core swapping as a work-around.\n\nA proposed \"restore\" command to the replication handler should allow specifying a directory, or an \"as-of\" date; otherwise you'd get the most recent snapshot.",
