    "description": "SOLR-11749 introduced a regression-test-suite for the bin/solr scripts.  This is one of a series of follow-on issues to expand the test coverage in this suite to cover more of the SolrCLI tools made available by bin/solr\n\nThis issue focused specifically on adding coverage for the start, stop, and restart commands to bin/solr.  Expanding this coverage is important for future refactors or additions to the bin/solr scripts, such as porting more of the logic back to Java code (SOLR-11206, SOLR-11946), or unifying the solr.in.* files used on Solr startup (SOLR-7871)",
