    "description": "I started work on this but with LUCENE-1044 I won't make much progress\non it for a while, so I want to checkpoint my current state/patch.\n\nFor backwards compatibility we must leave the default MergePolicy as\nselecting contiguous merges.  This is necessary because some\napplications rely on \"temporal monotonicity\" of doc IDs, which means\neven though merges can re-number documents, the renumbering will\nalways reflect the order in which the documents were added to the\nindex.\n\nStill, for those apps that do not rely on this, we should offer a\nMergePolicy that is free to select the best merges regardless of\nwhether they are continuguous.  This requires fixing IndexWriter to\naccept such a merge, and, fixing LogMergePolicy to optionally allow\nit the freedom to do so.",

Another option could be to leave it undefined, ie IW makes no commitment as to where it will place the newly merged segment so you should not rely on it.  Presumably apps that rely on Lucene's internal doc ID to \"mean something\" would not use a merge policy that selects non-contiguous segments.\n\nUnfortunately, with the current index format, there's a big cost to allowing non-contiguous segments to be merged: it means the doc stores will always be merged.  Whereas, today, if you build up a large new index, no merging is done for the doc stores.\n\nIf we someday allowed a single segment to reference multiple original doc stores (logically concatenating [possibly many] slices out of them), which would presumably be a perf hit when retrieving the stored doc or term vectors, then this cost would go away.

If we don't shift doc IDs back, it means maxDoc will continue to grow, and at some point (extreme case though), maxDoc will equal 1M, while there will be just 50K docs in the index.\n\nAFAIU, maxDoc is used today to determine array length in FieldCache, I've seen it used in IndexSearcher to sort the sub readers (at least in the past) etc. So perhaps alongside maxDoc we'll need to keep a curNumDocs member to track the actual number of documents?\n\nBut I have a feeling this will also get complicated.

The failure happens only if CMS is used, and doesn't when SMS is used. I dug deeper into the test and what happens is that the test asks to optimize(maxNumSegments) and expects that either: (1) if the number of segments was < maxNumSegments than the resulting number of segments is exactly as it was before and (2) otherwise it should be exactly maxNumSegments.\n\nFirst, the javadocs of optimize(maxNumSegments) say that it will result in <= maxNumSegments, but I understand the LogMergePolicy ensures that if you ask for maxNumSegments, that's the number of segments you'll get.\n\nWhile trying to debug what's wrong w/ the change so far, I managed to reduce the test to this code:\n\n\npublic void test1() throws Exception {\n    MockRAMDirectory dir = new MockRAMDirectory();\n\n    final Document doc = new Document();\n    doc.add(new Field(\"content\", \"aaa\", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.ANALYZED));\n\n    IndexWriter writer  = new IndexWriter(dir, new WhitespaceAnalyzer(), true, IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.LIMITED);\n//    writer.setMergeScheduler(new SerialMergeScheduler());\n    LogDocMergePolicy ldmp = new LogDocMergePolicy();\n    ldmp.setMinMergeDocs(1);\n    writer.setMergePolicy(ldmp);\n    writer.setMergeFactor(3);\n    writer.setMaxBufferedDocs(2);\n\n    MergeScheduler ms = writer.getMergeScheduler();\n//  writer.setInfoStream(System.out);\n    \n    // Add enough documents to create several segments (uncomitted) and kick off\n    // some threads.\n    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {\n      writer.addDocument(doc);\n    }\n    writer.commit();\n    \n    if (ms instanceof ConcurrentMergeScheduler) {\n      // Wait for all merges to complete\n      ((ConcurrentMergeScheduler) writer.getMergeScheduler()).sync();\n    }\n    \n    SegmentInfos sis = new SegmentInfos();\n    sis.read(dir);\n    \n    System.out.println(\"numSegments after add + commit ==> \" + sis.size());\n    \n    final int segCount = sis.size();\n    \n    int maxNumSegments = 3;\n    writer.optimize(maxNumSegments);\n    writer.commit();\n    \n    if (ms instanceof ConcurrentMergeScheduler) {\n      // Wait for all merges to complete\n      ((ConcurrentMergeScheduler) writer.getMergeScheduler()).sync();\n    }\n    \n    sis = new SegmentInfos();\n    sis.read(dir);\n    final int optSegCount = sis.size();\n    \n    System.out.println(\"numSegments after optimize (\" + maxNumSegments + \") + commit ==> \" + sis.size());\n    \n    if (segCount < maxNumSegments)\n      Assert.assertEquals(segCount, optSegCount);\n    else\n      Assert.assertEquals(maxNumSegments, optSegCount);\n}\n\n\n\nThis fails almost every time that I run it, so if you try it - make sure to run it a couple of times.

We apply deletes to segments being merged, but\nthen we place the merged segment back in the same position.  This is\ninefficient because later when this segment gets merged, we wastefully\nre-apply the same deletes (plus, new ones, which do need to be\napplied).  This is a total waste.\n\nSo, by decoupling tracking of where you are in the deletes packet\nstream, from the physical location of your segment in the index, we\nfix this waste.
