    "description": "If the index was created with autoCommit false, and more than 1\nsegment was flushed during the IndexWriter session, then the shared\ndoc-store files are incorrectly duplicated in\nIndexCommit.getFileNames().  This is because that method is walking\nthrough each SegmentInfo, appending its files to a list.  Since\nmultiple SegmentInfo's may share the doc store files, this causes dups.\n\nTo fix this, I've added a SegmentInfos.files(...) method, and\nrefactored all places that were computing their files one SegmentInfo\nat a time to use this new method instead.",
