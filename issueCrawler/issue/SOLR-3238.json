I found it highly annoying today when I updated Solr to find that the UI wasn't updated, even when I told my browser to force-reload.  I had to clear my browser cache.  I looked into this a bit and I propose that example/etc/webdefault.xml has the \"cacheControl\" piece of it be un-commented, and set the max-age to 60 (in seconds).  It is unlikely the timespan between a browser requesting it and Solr being shut down, updated, redeployed, and the browser fetches it again.  Possible but unlikely.  When this time span is exceeded, a browser would re-request the resources but it would get back a small 304 status to indicate the file hasn't changed, assuming it hasn't.  To be clear, this applies to the admin UI in the out-of-the-box jetty configuration, and doesn't apply to searches.  Sound good?  I can commit it trivially. "

I just ran an analysis on the title field in the trunk example and the first step in the output was in this order: text, start, end, type, position.  The other two steps were ordered like this: text, position, start, end, type.  At first I thought that the position had disappeared after the first step, then I noticed it was still there, just in a different place.\n\nOn the logging page: Many of the settings show null, italicized.  This would be fine, except that when you click on one, null is not one of the choices.  You have to choose UNSET to keep the setting the same.  One of them needs to change to match the other.  My thought is that in both places it should be \"unset\" or \"not set\" \u2013 lowercase and italicized.\n\nOn the Plugins page under the core: You can't open more than one of the dropdown items at once, and you can't close a dropdown once it's open.

I've currently got an index status page written in Perl that parses the XML output from the current admin GUI on four Solr servers.  The new GUI is absolutely beautiful from a human perspective, but I need to be able to pull the displayed information out in a machine-readable form as well.  Is there any way to do that?\n\nThe next version of my status page will be written in Java.  What kind of options will I have available for retrieving statistical information from a remote Solr instance?\n\nWhen I fired up the multicore example, I found that the cache statistics pages for both cores only had fieldCache and fieldValueCache.  The documentCache, filterCache, and queryResultCache were not present.  If there were other things missing, I didn't notice. "

I can even use wt=xml and modify my Perl script for any differences between 3.x and 4.x.  I have just tried the same URL on 3.x and found that it works there, too.  My scripts currently use the stats.jsp and a couple of other URLs, not mbeans.  I will have to experiment, but do you know of any documentation that covers everything that's available?\n\nWith SolrJ, currently I can use ModifiableSolrParams and set qt to /admin/mbeans to make this work.  In the wake of issues like SOLR-3161, SolrJ might need a new way to specify the base URL path. "
