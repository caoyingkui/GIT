To fix the javadocs some jars had to be added to the javadocs classpath. \n     But for gdata, even after adding the required jars there remained lots of errors that I \n     did not want to handle here. So I commented out the addition of gdata jars, and focused \n     in running javadocs with jdk 1.4.2.\n\n Some of the warning had to do with peculiarities of javadocs, In one case I replaced '?' \n     with  '?' - wasn't too happy with this, but it seemed nice at that particular code \n     to have the '?' at the middle of a summary line, which was causing the warning. (in \n     other places I changed the wording so that '?' was o more in the summary line).\n\n This is quite a technical fix - only javadoc comments where modified (and build.xml), so unless \n     there are objections I intend to commit it pretty soon.
