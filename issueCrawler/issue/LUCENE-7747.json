    "description": "In LUCENE-7638 we generate a query for each multi-token path in the graph and combine them at the end in a boolean query.  \nThis can lead to OOM when the number of path is big, instead we should build the disjunction of these paths lazily in order to throw \"too many clauses\" early if the number of paths is bigger than max boolean clauses.\nFor instance a shingle filter with shingles of different size produces a graph with multiple side paths at each position. If the input query has a lot of tokens, the number of paths (query) created is exponential. For this use case it is maybe preferable to disallow graph query analysis completely but when allowed we should also be protected against combinatorial explosion.",
