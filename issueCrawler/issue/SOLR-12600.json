When you do, include complete details, including how you're trying to do whatever it is you're trying to do, the expected outcome and the actual outcome.\n\nIf it's determined that this really is a code issue or enhancement to Solr and not a configuration/usage problem, we can raise a new JIRA or reopen this one.
