    "description": "Pawel Rog reported on the user list that he was seeing significantly slower search performance and much higher CPU usage using Solr 3.5 compared to Solr 1.4 when using the same configs he had always used in Solr 1.4 \u2013 even though he had a new index built with 3.5\n\nhttps://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201111.mbox/%3CCAF9ZkbPHo0Y-PvSkm4dkaNc7aArGacfSSHNQBL+nOOt1aHxLwA@mail.gmail.com%3E\n\nBased on stacktraces from threaddumps the \"useFilterForSortedQuery\" was determined to be a contributing factor, and disabling it improved performance (exact comparison not provided).  \n\nWould be nice to get some more details and a reproducible comparison (SOLR-2646 where are you???) and evluate why useFilterForSortedQuery would be slower in 3.5 then in 1.4 with the same data.\n\nShould consider actively removing the useFilterForSortedQuery=true option if there are no longer any usecases where it's better then useFilterForSortedQuery=false",
