    "description": "We would like to configure the DIH handler for a SLAVE connection for FULL imports, and a MASTER connection for DELTA.\n\nUse case:\n\n1. The DIH full index slams the database pretty hard, and we would like those to run one a day on the SLAVE MYSQL connection.\n2. The DIH delta index does not hit the database very hard, and we would like that to run off the MASTER MYSQL connection.\n\nCurrently the DIH handler does not allow a name=\"db-1\" on the deltaQuery=\"\", it is only at the entity level. Please add it to each delta, full, etc as an option.",
