Many people hit this and figure out how to work around it relatively quickly, but just fixing the grammar to accept it might be better?",

I first modified QueryParser.jj, then ran the javacc-QueryParser target to regenerate the parser.  I added a method to TestQueryParser to cover the change, and ensured all the tests under lucene/queryparser passed. ",

Currently, - and + are included.  Is there some reason these two are explicitly included, while others are not?  It's easy enough to add !, or others, but it would be good to understand if there is a historical basis for what's here. ",
