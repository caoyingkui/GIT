At least to me SuggestionIterator seems to imply the iterator for List<LookupResult> rather than the iterator that gets consumed by all the suggesters. Though I have to admit SuggestionIterator sounds a lot nicer than SuggestionInputIterator  ",

Shouldn't it go into suggest?\n\nIf HighFrequencyDictionary still wants to \"use it\" thats fine I think, but nothing in .spell cares about any of these iterators except for that they are BytesRefIterator (they just want to consume terms): I think it belongs in suggest.\n\nSo if we agree it belongs there, I think InputIterator is then a good name? it would be org.apache.lucene.suggest.InputIterator...\n\n ",

This would be consistent with JDK classes such as BufferedReader or BufferedInputStream: should be -ed, not -ing, and doesnt need -Wrapper either. ",
