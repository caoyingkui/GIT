    "description": "At the moment, it's impossible to configure Solr such that it build up documents by using data that comes from both pdf documents and database table columns. Currently, to accomplish this task, it's up to the user to add some preprocessing that converts pdf files into plain text files. Therefore, I would like to see an integration of Solr Cell into DIH that makes those preprocessing obsolete.",
