    "description": "I'd like to propose that we have another n-gram tokenizer which can process synonyms. That is NGramSynonymTokenizer. Note that in this ticket, the gram size is fixed, i.e. minGramSize = maxGramSize.\n\nToday, I think we have the following problems when using SynonymFilter with NGramTokenizer. \nFor purpose of illustration, we have a synonym setting \"ABC, DEFG\" w/ expand=true and N = 2 (2-gram).\n\n\n\tThere is no consensus (I think  how we assign offsets to generated synonym tokens DE, EF and FG when expanding source token AB and BC.\n\tIf the query pattern looks like XABC or ABCY, it cannot be matched even if there is a document \"\u2026XABCY\u2026\" in index when autoGeneratePhraseQueries set to true, because there is no \"XA\" or \"CY\" tokens in the index.\n\n\n\nNGramSynonymTokenizer can solve these problems by providing the following methods.\n\n\n\tNGramSynonymTokenizer reads synonym settings (synonyms.txt) and it doesn't tokenize registered words. e.g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource text\nNGramTokenizer+SynonymFilter\nNGramSynonymTokenizer\n\n\nABC\nAB/DE/BC/EF/FG\nABC/DEFG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe back and forth of the registered words, NGramSynonymTokenizer generates extra tokens w/ posInc=0. e.g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource text\nNGramTokenizer+SynonymFilter\nNGramSynonymTokenizer\n\n\nXYZABC123\nXY/YZ/ZA/AB/DE/BC/EF/C1/FG/12/23\nXY/YZ/Z/ABC/DEFG/1/12/23\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above sample, \"Z\" and \"1\" are the extra tokens.",
