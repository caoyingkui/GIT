Specifically, I'd like to see what size caches should be set to facet on given fields.\n\n\nFrom Hoss in: http://www.nabble.com/facet-optimizing-tf3187930.html#a8855581\n\nthat reminds me of an idea i had way back when for a Solr sanity checker tool that would inspect your schema, index, and logs of sample queries and point out things that didn't seem to make any sense, ie: String fields that don't omitNorms, sorting on a tokenized field, or a non-sortable int/float fields that werre multivalued but didnt' seem like they needed to be (because every doc only had one value) etc...",
