    "description": "The patch allows to add parameters to core admin reload command as in create command and it changes the core configuration as indicated in the parameters. \nAny parameter that is not indicated in the command will be the same as before.\nFor example, the command \nsolr/admin/cores?action=RELOAD&core=core0&transient=true\nwill change the core to be transient.\nIn my patch, I removed the parameter isTransientCore from the method registerCore in class CoreContainer. I chose to use cd.isTransient() instead.\nThe patch is based on Solr 4.8  \nThanks.",

We do not use SolrCloud and instead manage our highly multi-tenant farm.\n\nWithout this patch, it seems like the only alternative is to first call UNLOAD, the CREATE with the new parameters, but this would incur downtime compared to the deprecated pre-4.3 behaviour of CREATE.
