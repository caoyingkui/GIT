    "description": "Having the ability in SolrJ to log all HTTP URLs would be useful.  I'm thinking that the actual logging should be in HttpSolrClient, while the boolean flag and the method(s) to enable/disable it should be in SolrClient.\n\nIf there's a way to toggle the logging flag on CloudSolrClient and have it propagate down to the LBHttpSolrClient object, which then propagates to every HttpSolrClient object, that would be awesome.  Having all of them share the same AtomicBoolean object would probably require new constructors, but that would make the propagation very easy.  I don't like explosions in API footprints, so that will require consideration.",
