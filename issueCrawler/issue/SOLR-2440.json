Making difficult the match\n\tDoes not allow a drill down\n\n\n\nThis small patch solves the three issues: \n\n\tChanges the Css to do not capitalise the links\n\tSorts the field names\n\tIt replaces the tokens by links to a search query with that token\n\n\n\nthat's all",

If using a projector, then this low contrast colors are still worst, but in my screen where difficult to distinguish.\n\nThe patch includes 3 functionalities.\n\n\tDrill down : You can click on any of the items in the the list of most common words, to get the top documents having that item.\n\tField Selector: On the right of the field's Name there is a minus sign. Clicking on it changes to a plus sign. After changing the field to view, the next drill down actions will include these fields in the result. (if none selected only current field is shown)\n\tFilter query: When a filter query is specified, then the list of most common words and frequencies are obtained from the facets after doing a search using that filter. Not very scalable, but it helps when guessing some properties of the data imported.\n\n "
