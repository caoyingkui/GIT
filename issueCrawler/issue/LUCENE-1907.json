    "description": "see the related issue for comments.\n\nits a bummer - doesn't look like we have time to address this, but its the best release for it - back compat requires the reflection stuff that Similarity already has (and we hope to remove next release). It would suck to have to hold onto it - so it seems unlikely we will do this at a later time.\n\nThe idea is that the sumOfSquaredWeights computation should be specific to the queryNorm impl - so the queryNorm should accept the Weight instead, and if its using the euclidean distance formula, it can do the sumOfSquared calculations - but if its doing another normalization, these can be skipped (in each termweight, booleanweight, etc). Right now you pay for sumOfSquared no matter what, and the logic separation is a little off.",
