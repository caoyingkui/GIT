    "description": "ContextSuggestField indexes context information along with \nsuggestions, which can be used to filter and/or boost suggestions using \nContextQuery.\nIt would be useful to make ContextSuggestField extensible such that subclasses \ncan inject context values at index-time, without having to specify the \ncontexts in its ctor.\nContextQuery can be made extensible by allowing sub-classes to override\nhow context automaton is created from provided query contexts. \nCurrently, ContextQuery uses a context value of \"*\" to consider all context values, \nIt makes sense to have a dedicated addAllContexts() instead.",

            "content": "Thanks Michael McCandless for the review!\n\n\ncan you give some example use cases\nto motivate opening things up via subclassing?\nAn use-case for opening up ContextSuggestField#contexts() is to \nget context values from another field in a document. The \nfield in question might not be present at context field creation time\n(e.g. due to the field not being added yet) but can be accessed from the\ndocument when it is being indexed. Opening up contexts() will allow \nsub-classes to steal the context values from the document at index-time.\n\nAfter more thought, I have reverted opening up ContextQuery#convertAutomaton\nvia sub-classing, it has proven to be difficult to use. Originally, it was meant\nsuch that sub-classes can modify the context automaton without having to \nworry about all the implementation details. \n\n\nsaw some minor things:\n+import java.util.*;\nCould you fix your IDE to do keep each import separate? Thanks.\nFixed the imports.\n\n\nI think toString is now not-so-friendly vs before, since we cutover to\nIntsRef contexts key? (IntsRef.toString vs CharSequence.toString)\nThanks for catching this, now it uses BytesRef.utf8ToString\n\nUpdated Patch:\n\n\tmake toString friendly, fix up imports\n\trevert opening up ContextQuery#convertAutomaton\n\n "
