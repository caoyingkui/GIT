    "description": "Currently the FST uses the read(DataInput) method from the Outputs class to skip over outputs it actually is not interested in. For most use cases this just creates some additional objects that are immediately destroyed again.\n\nWhen traversing an FST with non-trivial data however this can easily add up to several excess objects that nobody actually ever read.",

            "content": "Attached an (untested) patch where a \"skipOutput\" method is added to the outputs which doesn't create excess objects. Default implementation is the current behavior by invoking the read() method.\n\nAlso a skipBytes(int) method was added to the DataInput which defaults to reading the data as before. Several implementations of the DataInput already had a skipBytes() method and now effectively implement it. ",

Maybe one should scan over all the other implementations if they had a similar method that was just named differently or could implement it (e.g. IndexInput could easily implement the skip method as a comination of seek and getFilePointer).

But now I saw that both trunk and the 4.8 branch have the skipBytes(long) already. So yes of course in that case we can drop it from the patch. If we can get consensus that the rest of the patch is worth doing I could implement it against 4.8 and attach it here.\n\nEdit: The ticket that added the skipBytes to the DataInput was LUCENE-5583 ",
