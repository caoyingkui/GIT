    "description": "When Solr disconnects from Zookeeper or Zookeeper disconnects from for some abnormal reason it is difficult to identify the root of the problem.    If we could have a mode that provide additional diagnostics both in the solr log and zookeeper log.\n\nIE:   Solr you could pull system stats about the current state of solr.  What is the load / memory.\n\nIE2:  For zookeeper,  if might show that the solr socket was abnormally closed but gives no further info.  See the example below.  \n\n2016-05-27 00:59:53,357 [myid:1] - INFO  [CommitProcessor:1:ZooKeeperServer@617] - Established session 0x154a2e5fd9b0b2a with negotiated timeout 120000 for client /17.34.240.66:356202016-05-27 01:00:57,627 [myid:1] - WARN  [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxn@357] - caught end of stream exceptionEndOfStreamException: Unable to read additional data from client sessionid 0x154a2e5fd9b0b24, likely client has closed socket at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.doIO(NIOServerCnxn.java:228) at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxnFactory.run(NIOServerCnxnFactory.java:208) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)2016-05-27 01:00:57,627 [myid:1] - INFO  [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxn@1007] - Closed socket connection for client /17.34.240.66:35266 which had sessionid 0x154a2e5fd9b0b242016-05-27 01:01:00,873 [myid:1] - INFO  [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxn@1007] - Closed socket connection for client /17.34.240.66:35508 which had sessionid 0x154a2e5fd9b0b292016-05-27 01:03:06,425 [myid:1] - INFO  [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxn@1007] - Closed socket connection for client /17.34.240.66:35620 which had sessionid 0x154a2e5fd9b0b2a",

            "content": "Zookeeper is an entirely separate project where we have no control.  From their perspective, Solr is no different than any other zookeeper user, so we do not have any greater influence than anyone else.  It's true that they are both Apache projects, but that name is about the only thing they have in common.  SolrCloud talks to Zookeeper over a network connection, even if you use the embedded zookeeper server.\n\nIf you want to change what zookeeper logs, you will need to talk to their mailing list and/or raise an issue in the ZOOKEEPER jira project.  If what you want to see is Solr-specific, it is not likely that they will implement what you're after.  Zookeeper itself has no knowledge about the applications that use it.\n\nAs for Solr, which we CAN change, what specifically are you interested in seeing in the logs? ",
