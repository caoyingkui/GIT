            "content": "This is a change I've considered making a few times too so I'm overall +1.\n\nThe reason I never made the change is because I'm not a huge fan of how the gray background spans the whole width of the page taken up by the TOC (I'd prefer it to scale dynamically with the size of the TOC that's inside it), but I'll live with that for now until I have time to look at it in more detail and see if I can get it to scale.\n\nSOLR-10612 added the ability to put the TOC on the right side of the page (see something like https://builds.apache.org/view/L/view/Lucene/job/Solr-reference-guide-master/javadoc/collections-api.html for an example), and the change in the proposed patch makes it so it's possible for that right-hand TOC to severely crowd out the content that's supposed to float next to it since it will span as much space as it needs. Adding a max-width: 300px; to the definition for toc-right confines it back into a reasonable space. New patch attached to show the change, but I'll commit both changes in a moment. ",
