    "description": "I have a requirement for partial and exact type.Now partial search work fine for NgramFilter within mingram & maxgram size range. Now when im trying to index a value less than mingram size,the tokens are not generated .Same things happens when the value is greater than maxgramsize.\n\n\nI haveto created a field type as shown below:\n<fieldType name=\"text_ngram\" class=\"solr.TextField\" positionIncrementGap=\"100\">\n\n<analyzer type=\"query\">\n\t\t<tokenizer class=\"solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory\"/>\n\t\t<filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n\t\t</analyzer>\n\t<analyzer type=\"index\">\n\t\t<tokenizer class=\"solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory\"/>\n\t\t<filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n\t\t<filter class=\"solr.NGramFilterFactory\" minGramSize=\"3\" maxGramSize=\"6\" preserveOriginal=\"true\"/>\n\t</analyzer>\n    </fieldType>\n\nwhen i'm trying to index a value say AB (it is not indexed and not searchable). Similarly if the value is GangulyKuntal (which is greater than maxgram size),the search is not working.\n\n**Increasing maxgram size to more than the anticipated value is not good design aspect.\n\nNgramFilter should keep the original tokens if it is less than mingram or greater than maxgram. By doing this it will make it truly partial as well as exact search solution.It would really be very helpful,if this changes are made in the coming release. Any suggestion will be of great help?",
