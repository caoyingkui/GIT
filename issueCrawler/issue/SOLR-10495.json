    "description": "I'd like to access a postgres database from my custom SearchComponent but unfortunately, I get the following error:\n\n\njava.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for postgres\n        at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:689)\n\tat java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:247)\n\tat ch.guidelines.util.SimpleDataSource.getConnection(SimpleDataSource.java:50)\n...\n\n\n\n... when I try to connect to the database using:\n\nSimpleDataSource.java\nprivate String dbUrl = \"jdbc:postgresql://db/mydb\";\n\npublic Connection getConnection(String dbUser, String dbPasswd) throws SQLException {\n    this.dbUser = dbUser;\n    this.dbPasswd = dbPasswd;\n    this.conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, dbUser, dbPasswd); // line 50\n    return conn;\n}\n\n\n\nI already use the DataImportHandler using the Postgres JDBC driver successfully. I tried putting the driver's jar in different locations:\n\n\t/opt/solr/dist (with added <lib ... /> entry in solrconfig.xml)\n\t/opt/solr/lib\n\t/opt/solr/server/lib\n\t/opt/solr/server/lib/ext\n\t/opt/solr/server/solr/lib (lib-folder in the solr.solr.home directory)\n\n\n\nBut nothing worked so far... How can I get the driver loaded in my custom SearchComponent?\n\nI'd really appreciate your help.",
