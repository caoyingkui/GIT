The default is 2.5%, for reference.  However, as configured, it is read in as a fraction:\n\n    <fieldType name=\"location_2d_trie\" class=\"solr.SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType\"\n               distErrPct=\"0.025\" maxDetailDist=\"0.001\" />",

            "content": "I'd like to look at the bigger picture with distance error.  I think there are two things a user might want to specify:\n\n\tWhat is the maximum distance detail the index should use for its calculations on this field.  In geospatial contexts, this might be 1 meter.  As applied to geohash prefix tree based Strategies this would result in using a particular maxLevels (geohash length) for the tree of about 10.\n\tWhat is the maximum error distance for a particular shape that I am indexing or querying by?  It is bounded by the previous statistic.  I might want to specify this in real distance terms (e.g. 1 meter) or have it be some fraction or percentage tied to the shape's size, which makes a nice default.\n\n\n\nThese end up being hints / constraints; a Strategy will very likely use more precision but should have at least as much precision as is asked for.  Sound good?  If so...\n\nSo would SpatialStrategy then have a setMaxDetailDist() and setDefaultDistErrPct() (for index & query shapes) ?  The problem with setMaxDetailDist is that, as a setter, it's done after the Strategy's construction; we don't have an init() method.  It could become another constructor argument, the 3rd:  SpatialStrategy(SpatialContext ctx, String fieldName, maxDetailDist) or maybe don't worry about it \u2013 add a getMaxDetailDist() that returns the actual maximum detail distance, and let initialization be up to the specific Strategy. I guess I like that best.  setDefaultDistErrPct() could be a simple setter with getter.  Supplying 0 implies maximum detail allowed by maxDetailDist. ",

            "content": "I think a couple of things:\n\n\n\tSpecifying absolute distance values e.g 1m, brings up issues of units.  If we use the units defined in the SpatialContext then it might not be clear what unit is currently configured when a consumer sets one of these distance values.  But also having to specify the unit every time sucks.  So I think if we're going to let users define absolute distances then we should use a single standard unit (km or m, I don't mind) and let consumers / adapters do the conversion themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\tAbsolute distances doesn't seem particularly useful when dealing with shapes of varying sizes.  1m might make sense for a small shape but seems a little crazy for massive shapes.  The nice thing about percentages is that they scaled well.\n\n\n\n\n\tWe should create a split between compulsory arguments and optional hints.  Anything compulsory should be a constructor argument and anything optional should be done via a setter.  If what you say is correct, that both of these are just knobs that can be turned but aren't compulsory, then they should stay out of the constructor but we should provide setters.\n\n ",

            "content": "I agree on unit standardization.\n\nAbsolute distance error for a shape would be a useful option to specify to SpatialArgument as part of the query.  It only accepts a percentage (actually fraction) now.\n\nI agree with your concept of the ramification of optional vs non-optional as compulsory arguments vs setters.  So:\n\n\tAdd \"distErrPct\" distance error percent to SpatialStrategy with getter & setter, acting as the default for index & query shapes with area.  The non-PrefixTree Strategies ignore it since they use the full precision that a Double works out to be.  I think this should be one of those documented things (i.e. what does the Strategy do with it).\n\tAdd \"maxDetailDist\" (that name could use improvement?) with getter and setter.  Although again, non-PrefixTree Strategies ignore it and use whatever a Double is, but this time the setter is pointless because this specific strategy happens to require this information earlier as part of its construction.  Maybe that could be changed?  And I think it would be neat for the getter to return the actual max detail which will generally be greater than what you ask for.\n\n\n\nDespite these being used just by PrefixTreeStrategy, it seems universal in how you specify what you want, what your spatial precision requirements are.\n\nRE \"maxDetailDist\" name, maybe \"smallestDist\"?  Or I dunno... maybe just keep it. ",

The user definitely does not do any conversion themselves. ",
