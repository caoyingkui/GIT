We are clustering around 1000 documents and these documents are fairly big documents (700 MB in size in unzipped state)\n\nWhen we were exploring, we found that the memory consumption came down when we add a field to the fl parameter of solr (the field is a double field).\"\n\nI don't know why adding a double field to fl would impact memory consumption, but it'd be good to verify we don't hold to too much stuff inside the clustering plugin (if not needed).",
