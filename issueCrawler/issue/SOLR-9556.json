            "content": "I've stepped through the code and I can't work out where the leak actually happens, but it seems that if the Overseer thread is started by its ElectionContext after everything else is shut down, then Overseer.close() doesn't get called.  I think there are a couple of things we can do here:\n1) Close the election threads right at the beginning of CoreContainer shutdown.  This should help prevent spurious leader elections on closing nodes.\n2) Always quit Overseer threads on interrupt.  At the moment they check to see if they're closed first, but is there really any situation in which a thread is interrupted but it shouldn't then exit? ",

So the final container needs to take over the overseer role just so that it can shut down cleanly. ",
