    "description": "Let's say I have a dataset of a 100M document\n\nAfter applying a filter the number of documents found would be 5k so it's tiny.\n\nIf I do a search and a rollup stream the query returns in the 200ms range.\n\nBut if by mistake I add the \"partitionKeys\"\u00a0param to the search stream the hash query parser is invoked which runs on the entire document set and the query time spikes up to 7 seconds.\u00a0\n\nIf we aren't providing a parallel stream we should ignore the\u00a0partitionKeys param\n\nSample Query:\n\nrollup(search(gettingstarted,q=\"*:*\",fl=\"id\",sort=\"id desc\",partitionKeys=\"id\"),over=\"id\")\n\nBecause of the\u00a0partitionKeys the underlying query formed is:\n\nparams={q=*:*&distrib=false&fl=id&sort=id+desc&partitionKeys=id&fq={!hash+workers%3D1+worker%3D0}&wt=json&version=2.2} hits=2 status=0 QTime=30\n\nThis is a dummy dataset so don't see the the hits and QTime but this query certainly doesn't need to add the hash query parser filter clause for workers=1",
