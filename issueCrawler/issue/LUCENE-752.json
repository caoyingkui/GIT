    "description": "Some tests use java.io.tmpdir, while others use tempDir (which is defined in common-build.xml).  Those that rely on java.io.tmpdir can fail when being run on the same machine as someone else who is running tests (this came up in testing the new nightly build scripts on lucene.zones.a.o)\n\nProposed fix is to map java.io.tmpdir in the ANT Junit task to be the same value as tempDir.",
