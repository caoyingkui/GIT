            "content": "Hi Robert,\nhere the patch that implements this. You can add the remaining fields and commit if you like.\n\nThere is one general problem with adding deprecations in general (when doing byte-code analysis):\n\nIn bytecode, we only know two things:\n\n\tThe type of field or local variable or static class, on which we do the invoke/putfield/getfield, but we don't know any parent class (in ASM this is called \"owner\").\n\tthe name and signature of the method/field to call/getfield/putfield.\n\n\n\nSo if you add java.lang.Throwable#printStackTrace() to the list, it will only find invocations of local variables/fields of type java.lang.Throwable. So code like:\n\n\nException e = .... / } catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace()\n\n\n\nwill in bytecocde have no reference to java.lang.Throwable. This would need more work. I will sleep a night about it... ",

It just means our checker isn't as thorough as it is, but none of our checkers/tests are perfect.\n\nYes it is not as thorough for things like Throwable.printStackTrace(), but for the JVM's deprecated list, we should still catch almost all, as the deprecated list in the JVM is complete (it also should list subclasses - if method is overridded).\n\nFor the original checks we did at beginning (encoding, locale,... problems), this was also thorough enough, as we listed all calls that may be used. If a custom subclass in Lucene code would subclass this system class and modify a \"forbidden method\", the \"super\" call would trigger the violation report.\n\nI think this is ready to commit, Robert can you check with Apache RAT installed?
