    "description": "Currently the user need to make sure that a direct source is not shared between threads and each time someone calls getDirectSource we create a new source which has a reasonable overhead. We can certainly reduce the overhead (maybe different issue) but it should be easier for the user to get a direct source and handle it. More than that is should be consistent with getSource / loadSource.",
