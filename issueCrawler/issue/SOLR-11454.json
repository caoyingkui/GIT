    "description": "The point of SoftAutoCommitTest is to ensure that auto-commits fire when expected.\n\nThe timing based checks on those autocommits are a semi-neccessary evil to ensure that the test doesn't get false positives due to some other commits.\nThe test also sanity checks that auto-commits result in newSearcher events if/when they should \u2013 but these also (currently) have timing checks ot ensure that they happen \"fast enough\" ... this seems unneccessary (given the purpose of hte test) and broken (there's no guarantee/expectation how fast a searcher will open, even though the test assumes it will be a number relative to the autocommit setting.\n\nwe should relax these assertions, and just ensure that the searcher eventually opens in a non-absurd amount of time, not fail if it isn't some specific math function relative to other events.",

But there is no garuntee that a newSearcher event triggered by the (auto)SoftCommit will finish before a subsequent hard commit.\n\nwe should remove this (type of) check and instead either:\n\n\twait for an extended period after the hard commit to assert there isn't a second newSearcher\n\tadd a varient of these test methods where hardAutoCommit is disabled to ensure the searcher we eventually get is in fact because of the (auto)softCommit\n\t\n\t\tit would probably be pretty easy to parameterize the softCommitWaitMillis and hardCommitWaitMillis in methods, so a variant could use hardCommitWaitMillis=-1, and then do the hardCommit assertions conditionally if and only if 0 < hardCommitWaitMillis\n\t\n\t\n\n ",
