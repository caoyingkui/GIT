    "description": "Hi guys,\n\nI am having weird problem. I am currently using solr 1.5-dev. Wanted to switch to 4.0. Have dropped my indexes as they are not backward compatible and have run DIH. All data have been indexed and were even searchable for a short while, after that all have been suddenly dropped.\n\nAll is working fine on 1.5 so it force me to thinking that it must be some kind of bug in 4.0\n\n\ncheers,\n/Marcin",
