In 8.0 we can simply assume it'll happen the new field-attached way. Ultimately the distinction doesn't have a material effect on the final result for current/legacy schemas (indexes the same); it just exposes this metadata during the URP stages should it be useful/interesting there. New schemas that have nest_path require this metadata. The flag was \"safe\" in case we accidentally did harm \u2013 perhaps due to custom URPs. In 8.0 we can\u00a0always attach as a field. ",
