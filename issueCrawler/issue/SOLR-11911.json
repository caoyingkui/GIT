            "content": "This test doesn't use MiniSolrCloudCluster, it uses the simulator. However, you're right that the underlying issue was the Callable-s that didn't want to shut down when the executors were shutdown, specifically the loop in ComputePlanAction. In\u00a0regular (non-simulated) tests that use small clusters and small collections this wasn't visible, but here with a 100 nodes and thousands of replicas the time it takes to compute all operations becomes significant - larger than the thread linger time.\n\nRegarding the shutdown of the cluster - whether simulated or not - it should interrupt the processing of autoscaling events because they won't be acted upon anyway.\n\nso even if one of these executor tasks was effectively blocked forever, shouldn't that be causing the test to timeout, not report a leaked thread?\nThe executor that processes trigger events (which manages the threads that were leaking here) is closed using shutdownNow for the reason above. This interrupts the threads, but the actual code didn't check for the interrupted status and continued looping. ",
