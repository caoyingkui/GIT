    "description": "as reported by Andreas Hubold on solr-user...\n\n\nI'd like to just set it to a subdirectory of solr home (a \"cores\" directory to\navoid confusion with configsets and other directories). I tried\n\n<str name=\"coreRootDirectory\">cores</str>\n\nbut that's interpreted relative to the current working directory. Other paths \nsuch as sharedLib are interpreted relative to Solr Home and I had expected \nthis here too.\n\n\n\nThis is definitely non-intuitive and we should try to fix it in 5.0 since it will represent a back-compat change for anyone already using a relative path.",

As long as you don't have core.properties files in any other location under the solr home besides the place you want Solr to search, and there aren't thousands or millions of files/directories, it won't present any problems to have Solr search the entire solr home.
