Right now I'm a bit sceptic to try to mash the three languages into one filter, but if they end up sharing most of the rules it could be an option to make a Scandinavian filter parameterized with mode=no|se|dk|scandinavian. There are many use cases spanning content from the whole region which could benefit from a unified solution. ",
