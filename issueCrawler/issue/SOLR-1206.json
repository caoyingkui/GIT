    "description": "We recently had a solr server go down as the underlying disk (where the data was) stopped responding. The server was still running and the admin GUI worked, as did the ping query. But any actual query (like select?q=:) would hang indefinitely.\n\nI know that you can modify the ping query to be more robust, but I would like to suggest that the default shipping ping tries to access data, as I imagine that's what your average user is testing when they \"ping solr\"",
