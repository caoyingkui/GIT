    "description": "It would be nice if CellTokenStreams were re-used, which are kinda heavy.  This is possible without changing the API thanks to LUCENE-5634.  PrefixTreeStrategy.createFields() should return Field subclasses that override TokenStream tokenStream(Analyzer analyzer, TokenStream reuse) that in turn examine re-use to ensure it's a CellTokenStream, and then re-use it if possible or create anew.\n\nCompleting the re-use, it would be good if TreeCellIterator could be re-used, which might include the getWorldCell value.",
