I have a rather hacked up solution now, that uses\n\"-Dtestpackage=XXX\" to split the tests up.\n\nIdeally I would be able to say \"use N threads\" and it'd do the right\nthing... like the -j flag to make.",

Ran it again this morning and got the hanging behavior.  The difference is that last night the only thing running on my computer besides a couple of ssh terminal windows was the  tests.  Today when I ran the tests and got the hanging behavior, I have firefox, outlook, exceed, wordpad open.  The tests are taking 98-99.9% of my cpu while hanging.  I suspect there is some kind of resource issue when running the tests in parallel.\n\nTom Burton-West ",
