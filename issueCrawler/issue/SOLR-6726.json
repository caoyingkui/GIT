I'll confirm this and maybe propose a fix if I can reproduce. Assigning it to me so I make sure it's checked.\n\nI'm at Lucene Revolution this week, so if anyone wants to pick this up feel free.",

And I always run as admin so SOLR-6791 isn't really an issue for me so whatever you think best.\n\nHmmm, P.S. What would help most might be to echo what ports are being used as part of the script rather than make users look through documentation. Or even just have the help screen for the -p option indicate how the other ports are being assigned. ",
