    "description": "As pointed out by Ryan on LUCENE-5826\n\nThis is the most complicated part, basically intersecting against 3 FSTs. But currently its premature to try to fix: its incomplete. it doesn't yet implement all the features it needs like decomposition. After we do this, we should see if we can refactor logic (e.g. somehow share affix compatibility better and so on).",
