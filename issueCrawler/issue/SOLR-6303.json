    "description": "I have an issue where after reloading Solr a few times Tomcat runs out of permgen space. After a little bit of investigation it seems that if I reload Solr without running the DataImportHandler and then perform garbage collection the amount of used permgen memory seems to return to roughly where it was before. However, if I run the DataImportHandler and then reload, the amount of memory will not return to where it was before. If this is repeated a few times it will eventually cause Tomcat to hang and throw a \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space\" error.",

            "content": "While I agree that this is a bug that needs fixing, I believe there are also other memory leak problems when restarting the application instead of the entire servlet container.  Because I was told about the other problem by some extremely smart people that love to fix bugs, I suspect that it is not at all easy to fix.  If I'm wrong, everyone please feel free to ignore me.\n\nThere are two recommended ways to get Solr to notice a new configuration, depending on exactly what got changed: Reload the core/collection, or restart the entire servlet container.  Reloading the core handles almost all config changes, restarting the container gets everything else. "
