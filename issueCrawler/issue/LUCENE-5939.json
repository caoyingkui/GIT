If you build lucene from source you always have SNAPSHOT versions. This is done to differentiate then from \"official builds\". \"lucene.version\" is a metadata field that is initialized with the \"human-readable version\", which now disappeared in 4.10, because we no longer read the JAR manifest.

You said, the information is useless (like svn rev number or user that build or full version). It is in fact not. From that you can determine, if an index was built using the \"original lucene jars\" or some (maybe modified) private compiled versions. So I would really like to have that LUCENE_DISPLAY_VERSION back (currently the constant LUCENE_VERSION that contained this is deprecated). I would really like to write this version (e.g. as display or full version string to the commit metadata). I had one customers where i found out that they patched their lucene, causing corrumption. Based on the CheckIndex output this was easy to detect. The display/full version including rev no and user and appendix is in the JAR Manifest (which is good), but no longer in index metadata! ",
