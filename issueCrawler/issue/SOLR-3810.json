There was an issue a while ago where wonky results happened if you were using Solr cloud and used batch updates from SolrJ that's since been fixed but isn't in Beta......\n\nNot at all sure this'll fix your problem, but it would help to insure it isn't the problem Of course if you're not using SolrCloud this is irrelevant.
