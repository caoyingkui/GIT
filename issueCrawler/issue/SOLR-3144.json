    "description": "The parameter marshalling de-marshalling is broken in Solrj's JavaBinUpdateRequestCodec. \n\nThe bug can be reproduced by adding a parameter e.g. overwrite=false as parameter to the UpdateRequest. After desiarilizing on the backend side the value will be not \"false\" it will be \"[false]\" which results in an Exception in the backend and documents will not be imported.\n\nThis issue can easily be fixed by replacing the serialization method with the correct one in SolrParams.

I couldnt verify the existence of this bug on trunk anymore and everything works fine for me. I missed SOLR-3037.\n\nHowever it might be a good idea to replace the toNamedList method in the Codec by the toNamedList method from SolrParams.\n\nI close this as duplicate to SOLR-3037. "
