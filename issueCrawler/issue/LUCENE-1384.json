This is to prevent addIndexesNoOptimize from returning until\nafter all external segments have been carried over (merged or copied)\ninto the index, so that if there is an exception (eg disk full),\naddIndexesNoOptimize is able to rollback to the index to the starting\npoint.\n\nThe primary merge() method of CMS indeed does not BG any external\nmerges, but the bug is that when a BG merge finishes it then selects a\nnew merge to kick off and that selection is happy to pick an external\nsegment.",
