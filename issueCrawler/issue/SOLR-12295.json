    "description": "Presently TimeRoutedAliasUpdaateProcessor calls the MaintainRoutedAliasCmd command to handle the book keeping around creation of new and deletion of obsolete collections (the collections are representing time segments within the time routed alias). While we generally need to wait for collection creation before proceeding, since the incoming request may\u00a0 be placing a document in the collection to be created, deletions need only be initiated and do not need to impede processing of updates.\n\nIn stress testing in SOLR-11949 the delays caused by synchronous updates were sufficient to fail the test via an apparent deadlock (actual locked threads could not be located however). With async deletes provided in this patch the stress test has passed for several consecutive executions.",
