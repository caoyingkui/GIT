    "description": "AnalyzerFactory, added to the benchmark module in LUCENE-4723, is a factory of factories: as part of creating an analyzer, each analysis pipeline component's factory is invoked to create the component instances.\n\nBut unlike in Solr, where all analysis pipelines are explicitly specified per-field, benchmark algorithms have no way to specify per-field analyzers - an analyzer is always applied to all fields.\n\nI propose a new task PerFieldAnalyzerFactoryTask, which would invoke PerFieldAnalyzerFactory: a factory of factories of factories.\n\n(I've left \"Wrapper\" out of the name - it's already verging on overly long, and I don't think the meaning is compromised.)\n\nI don't have an implementation yet - I wanted to see if people think there's a different/better way to do this.",
