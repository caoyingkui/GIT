    "description": "There are several example/files improvements/fixes that are warranted:\n\n\n\tFix e-mail and URL field names (<email>_ss and <url>_ss, with angle brackets in field names), also add display of these fields in /browse results rendering\n\tImprove quality of extracted phrases\n\tExtract, facet, and display acronyms\n\tAdd sorting controls, possibly all or some of these: last modified date, created date, relevancy, and title\n\tAdd grouping by doc_type perhaps\n\tfix debug mode - currently does not update the parsed query debug output (this is probably a bug in data driven /browse as well)\n\tHarden update-script: it currently errors if documents do not have a \"content\" field (eg indexing basic CSV), but should instead skip extraction of e-mail addresses and URLs when no \"content\".  Not quite the use case (no \"content\") for example/files, but no reason to error in the update script at least.\n\tFilter out bogus e-mail addresses.  I'm seeing email_ss = \"?@[^],\\,/^@[$_a-z]\" for some documents (using Solr docs/ directory as the dataset)",
