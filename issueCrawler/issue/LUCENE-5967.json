    "description": "In LUCENE-5879, we added auto-prefix terms, where the terms dict finds good prefix terms to index, so that at search time PrefixQuery and TermRangeQuery can visit far fewer terms than the full set.\n\nWildcardQuery and RegexpQuery will only make use of auto-prefix terms if it's \"effectively\" a PrefixQuery (e.g. WildcardQuery(\"foo*\")), but we could fix them so they could also use auto-prefix terms for other cases (e.g. foo?b*) though in practice it's less likely to have an impact I think.",
