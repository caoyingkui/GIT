It would seem very odd to have ssl connections just stall like that \u2013 think of any web server or something... how does it work there?\n\nAnyway, my impression from debugging hangs related to sockets was that freebsd's port of openjdk is not thoroughly tested (that accept issue would have been caught by regular openjdk tests I think).

It would seem very odd to have ssl connections just stall like that \u2013 think of any web server or something... how does it work there?\n\nI don't know - see SOLR-5776 for more info about SSL-related test failures on Jenkins.\n\nAll of the recent TestCloudSchemaless failures on Jenkins were stuck reading SSL sockets, so if it's not entropy depletion, it's something related to SSL sockets.  (We'll see in a day or two if TestCloudSchemaless stops failing regularly; I added the @SuppressSSL annotation to it.)\n\nMore FreeBSD-specific entropy info:\n\n\n\tFreeBSD's /dev/urandom is symlinked to /dev/random:\n\n\nsarowe@lucene[867]$ ls -ld /dev/random /dev/urandom\ncrw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel    0,  13 Jul 17 18:38 /dev/random\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel         6 Jun 18 23:22 /dev/urandom -> random\n\n\n\tFreeBSD's /dev/random blocks when there is insufficient entropy; from http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?format=html&query=random(4):\n\n\nThe kern.random.sys.seeded\tvariable indicates whether or not the random\ndevice is in an acceptably\tsecure state as\ta result of reseeding.\tIf set\nto\t0, the device will block (on read) until the next reseed (which\tcan be\nfrom an explicit write, or\tas a result of entropy harvesting).  A reseed\nwill set the value\tto 1 (non-blocking).\n\nand from https://wiki.freebsd.org/201308DevSummit/Security/DevRandom:\n\nHow /dev/random works today: The primary source of randomness is the Yarrow PRNG.\n[...]\nYarrow [...] need[s] to accumulate a certain amount of entropy before [it] can start generating random numbers. Until that happens, reads from /dev/random will block.\n\nMore info about randomness sources at https://wiki.freebsd.org/201308DevSummit/Security/DevRandom.\n\n "
