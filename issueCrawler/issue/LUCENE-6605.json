    "description": "I have a tokenizer which sets the payload attribute and which drives the highlighter. In Formatter.highlightTerm() I need to examine that payload on the token. However TokenGroup.addToken() doesn't currently set the payload on the token which is created and fed through to Formatter.highlightTerm() within the TokenGroup.\n\nI would suggest, TokenGroup.addToken():\n\ntoken.setPayload(payloadAtt.getPayload());\n\nhaving of course registered the payload attribute during initialisation of TokenGroup with:\n\npayloadAtt = tokenStream.addAttribute(PayloadAttribute.class);",
