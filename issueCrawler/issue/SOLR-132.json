Please let me know if you would like to have it as a separate file.. I also added some functional test i.e. i18n_full_cycle_test. \n\nThis is my first patch  I am sure I have made mistake so please do come back with things that you would like me to change!\n\nRegards",

Maybe you're running the functional tests outside of Rake?   If you run \"rake test\" it'll fire up Solr on port 8888 and run the functional tests against it.

I'll commit your tests after you make these adjustments, and we'll be on our way to a solid i18n solrb. "
