    "description": "solr.xml's sharedLib is a great way to add plugins that should be shared across all cores/collections.\n\nFor increased flexibility I would like for it to take a list of paths. Then I'd put Solr's own contrib libs in one shared folder \"solrJars\" and custom plugins with deps in another \"customerJars\". That eases Solr upgrades, then we can simply wipe and replace all jars in \"solrJars\" during upgrade.\n\nI realize that solr.xml is going away, and so the same request will be valid for whatever replaces solr.xml, whether it be system prop or properties file.",

Then we keep the syntax the same and don't need to parse separators. The fact that it's solr.xml would suggest that the libs will be shared between cores, so <lib> should be enough. "

            "content": "Another idea (brought up in SOLR-4653) is the use of a better glob pattern syntax. My idea was to use similar approach like ANT's fileset/classpath definitions. We can use plexus-utils-1.1.jar, which provides DirectoryScanner that understands patterns like **/*.jar.\n\nAlso your patch is now outdated after SOLR-4652: You should not create a ClassLoader at all, but instead add the components of classpath to the shared ResourceLoader using addToClassPath(). See the changes in SOLR-4652. "
