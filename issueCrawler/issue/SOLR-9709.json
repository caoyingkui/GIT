It's missing the parameters and some other information, which has been on the Ref Guide TODO list for a very long time.\n\nAdding the new params to the Solr Wiki perpetuates the problem of documentation in 2 places. I suggest that a more complete resolution to this is to migrate the missing content from the Solr Wiki to the Ref Guide and turn the Solr Wiki page into a stub as outlined here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Internal+-+Maintaining+Documentation#Internal-MaintainingDocumentation-Migrating\"Official\"DocumentationfromMoinMoin. That would help with the overall migration process, which has been stalled for a long time but is still a major issue with documentation. ",
