            "content": "I think that having one place for all our examples is a great idea. lucene-demo (or maybe we rename it to lucene-examples) sounds like the right place.\n\nI took a look at all the nocommit moves, and some are easy to resolve, but others not so easy. For example:\n\n\n\tFacetsPayloadProcessorProviderTest tests PayloadProcessorProvider, through TaxonomyMergeUtils. TMU, imo, should remain in examples, but I don't think that we should duplicate its logic in facet/src/test/. If we move to test to the examples, it will show as if PPP is not tested by the facets package ...\n\n\n\n\n\tMultiCLIndexer/Searcher are good examples of how to create multiple category lists for different facets. They are used by some facet tests code, even though they have tests of their own, as utilities to indexing such documents. Duplicating the logic seems wrong to me, and moving them to facet/src/test is also wrong.\n\n\n\nSo question \u2013 what's wrong with having tests depend on other modules? None of the facet/src/java code depends on any module now, but what if facet tests would depend on demo? ",

            "content": "These are not general utilities \u2013 they are really example code that show how to index all sort of facet stuff. The examples generate some docs randomly, while other methods use example text as documents, and some predefined categories (with weights). Really, the examples package is meant to be whole in the sense that it comes with some example data, evaluation methods and example code.\n\nSome facet tests just use these methods as convenient test utilities to index a bunch of documents, but that's it. Moving these utils into e.g. FacetTestUtils will remove them from the examples, which is not good. Keeping them there introduces a dependency on lucene-demo. So seems to me that we need to duplicate a lot of code just to avoid the dependency on lucene-demo, that exist anywhere for test purposes only.\n\nAre there other modules with example code? If not, perhaps we should wait until we have some more modules with such examples, before we refactor things?\n\nAnother option would be to keep the examples in facet, but package them into lucene-demo/examples-4.0.0.jar. That way, someone can take the demo.jar, or the lucene-facet.jar. If he wants to run tests (why would he?), he'll need to put the lucene-demo in the classpath. ",
