    "description": "Hi all, I facing the following issue with Solr 5.2.1 and the ongoing version 5.4.\nThe restore functionality is not working under Linux and causing an exception on Windows machines each time you want to restore an existing backup twice or even more.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Start a Solr instance pointing the solr_home to e.g. the example-DIH  folder.\n2. Select a core, e.g. the \u201csolr\u201d core.\n3. Switch to the \u201cDocuments\u201d tab\n4. Add a document \n{\u201cid\u201d:\u201d1\u201d,\u201dtitle\u201d:\u201dchange.me\u201d}\n5. Do a backup with the following API call \u201c/solr/replication?command=backup&name=test\u201d\nThe backup defaults to the location solr_home/solr/data/snapshot.test\n6. Add a document to the index \n{\u201cid\u201d:\u201d2\u201d,\u201dtitle\u201d:\u201dchange.me\u201d}\n. Now there a two document in the index.\n7. Restore the back with the following call \u201c/solr/replication?command=restore&name=test\u201d\nNew index location \u201csolr_home/solr/data/restore.snapshot.test\u201d is created without any physical file in it, except the file write.lock. Num Docs is now 1 as expected!\n8. Add a document to the index \n{\u201cid\u201d:\u201d3\u201d,\u201dtitle\u201d:\u201dchange.me\u201d}\n. Now there a two document in the index.\n9. Restore the same previous created back again with the following call \u201c/solr/replication?command=restore&name=test\u201d. Notice, there are still 2 docs in the index!!!\n10. Try to restore again, but still the same, 2 docs in the index\u2026\n11. Shut down Solr, you will see the index folder \u201csolr_home/solr/data/restore.snapshot.test\u201d disappears.\n12. Restart Solr. You will notice the following log entry \u201cSolr index directory \u2018solr_home/solr/data/restore.snapshot.test\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist. Creating new index\u201d, and indeed the Index is empty, showing 0 documents.\n13. After the restart, I tried to restore the existing backup again without any results\u2026\n\nI thing this behavior in not intended!!!\n\nEven more Problems arise when you run Solr on a Windows machine.\nAfter step 10 a folder \u201cindex\u201d is created under \u201csolr_home/solr/data/\u201d with a write.lock file in it. After that, the following exception is thrown: \n\u2026Error closing IndexWriter\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: file: MMapDirectory@D:\\solr\\Solr_versions\\solr-5.2.1\\...restore.snapshot.test lockFactory=org.apache.lucene.store.Nat\niveFSLockFactory@3d3d7a0e appears both in delegate and in cache\n\nThe log file from the Windows test is attached.\n\nLet me know if you have problems reproducing the same behavior,\n\nRegards Johannes",
