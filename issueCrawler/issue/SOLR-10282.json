            "content": "Here's a patch for enabling kerberos support using bin/solr script. Here's the expected usage:\n\n\n$ bin/solr auth enable -type kerberos -config \"-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/home/foo/jaas-client.conf -Dsolr.kerberos.cookie.domain=192.168.0.107 -Dsolr.kerberos.cookie.portaware=true -Dsolr.kerberos.principal=HTTP/192.168.0.107@EXAMPLE.COM -Dsolr.kerberos.keytab=/keytabs/107.keytab\"\n\n\n\nThis will upload a security.json to ZK that sets up KerberosPlugin, and adds the \"config\" parameter to the solr.in.sh. The user would need to restart the node after performing this step.\n\nGoing forward, we can make this script support interactive by accepting (and guiding/suggesting) the various configuration parameters, like a wizard. Possibly, even helping the user in writing the JAAS configs.\n\nThere are some nocommits that need to be resolved before committing, but this is close and it seems to work functionally. ",

            "content": "Updated patch removing all nocommits.\nIn short, this patch does the following:\n\n\tIf there is an accessible ZK (either via a running Solr or via -zkHost parameter), upload security.json. If not, just print the contents of security.json that user should upload himself/herself.\n\tUpdate the include file with the given configuration string (Solr startup parameters).\n\tInstruct the user to restart any running Solr nodes.\n\n\n\nThis feature can be made smarter later (e.g. guided wizard that even helps user write up the jaas configuration files).\n\nThis is quite close now. I'm planning to commit this soon. ",
