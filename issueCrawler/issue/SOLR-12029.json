    "description": "While writing a unit test I became curious about exactly what statuses can come back (mostly checking that negative values can never be returned) and when I looked at the ErrorCode enum I realized that the \"UNKNOWN\" code has the the value 0, which is the same status value that is used to indicate success. Since the code in org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore#postDecorateResponse sets the error code as the status in the event of an error, any client that looks at the status value to determine if the request succeeded would conclude that an UNKNOWN error was a success.\n\nThis value is explicitly set into SolrExceptions twice in RestoreCore once in DeleteReplicaCmd and once in PageTool.\n\nAlso org.apache.solr.search.join.GraphQueryTest#doGraphQuery uses it as a default representing success.\n\nI'm not entirely sure of the history or whether those exception cases really do want to be interpreted as success, so I'm putting this issue up here to get some discussion of whether these are bugs, and if perhaps we should refactor ErrorCode.UNKNOWN to ErrorCode.SUCCESSFUL_REQUEST to avoid future confusion? Possibly we need to then add in a new ErrorCode.UNKNOWN that has some other value.",
