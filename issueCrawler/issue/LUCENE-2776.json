It only seems to happen when the IW session is still open and a new segment is flushed.  Hence, if you raise the buffer size, you will also avoid the extra termvector info in this test. ",

Or it's \"just\" that IW is now creating files that it should not (which is a real issue that we need to fix).\n\nAnd in fact I see it happening even if you put IW.commit() in the loop and it happens in 3.x, 3.0.x and 2.9.x, as far as I can tell (I backported LUCENE-2759 there).\n ",
