I will try to post a link on my website or the Lucene website for people to view.\n\nI copied SOLR's structure (and Hadoop's, it seems) and then brought in the files from the xdocs directory.  I then gave all these files a facelift for Forrest.\n\nI went through all the pages, but I may have missed something so, I am looking for some other eyes to help spot errors.\n\nOne thing that is missing is the link to the Nightly version of the website(in the left menu, under Site Versions).  I am waiting to get setup on zones.apache.org per Doug's email.  Once I get that figured out, I will put in the proper link.\n\nNote that the xdocs directory gets deleted.  All significant documentation related files are safely moved to the src/site directory structure.\n\nI can put a prebuilt version  on people.apache.org, but I am not sure if Apache would like me to post the URL for consumption to the public.  Does anyone know if it is alright to publish a website such as this on people.apache.org under my user account?  Doug?  If it is OK, I will send out a URL for people to view, otherwise download the patch and give it a try.\n\nIf I don't hear back  by next Friday or so (the 10th), I will commit this patch and make this the official Lucene website.

I am not going to submit a patch, just yet, instead I ask that people go review the site at http://people.apache.org/~gsingers/site/  (note: the breadcrumbs at the top reflect that it is deployed on my site and will be different when on the real site)\n\nHere is a summary of what will be in the patch/commit when we are ready:\n1. Move xdocs etc. into Forrest common structure under src/site (as is the case w/ SOLR and Hadoop)\n2. xdocs and docs directory are deleted\n3. site directory is cleaned out and the new site is put in there\n4. New site update instructions will be the same as: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Website_Update_HOWTO\n\nThe \"Site Versions\" section will eventually have a link to a nightly build of the site (as per issue 708) but we are having some infrastructure issues w/ setting this up for now, but that part will be coming soon and I am going to decouple that bug from this one so as to not hold up this one.\n\n\nPlease let me know what you think, but stick to layout problems and introduced errors (i.e. write up a different bug for errors in the documentation that already exist).\n\nThanks!\nGrant ",

I pretty much copied SOLR's layout and then moved Lucene Java XDocs into the site structure, so I think they are at least consistent with the other sub-projects.\n\nAlso, not sure about the logos.  The other sites have our \"original\" logo on the left, as the Lucene brand, and then their logo (SOLR, Hadoop) as the larger icon.  Lucene Java has always used the green Lucene logo, so I wasn't sure what to do, so I had it up there twice.  But I like the feather idea, so I have changed that\n\nOn Releases, Steve Rowe suggested that I change the menu link to be \"Downloads\", which I have done (I also added a info on how to get the source code)\n\nOtis, thanks for the Lucene4C info.  I wasn't sure on it's status, so I left it as is.  I have now removed it.\n\nYonik, I agree the website update info should be made generic, but that is beyond my control for coordinating across projects at this point, so I am going to default to copying for now.  I would be happy to document/help w/ any top-level coordination to make it easier for any future projects that fall under Lucene (I'm holding my breath for the Pascal version of Lucene   ) or to come up w/ a standard template for docs.\n\nAs always, the changes can be seen at http://people.apache.org/~gsingers/site/  (you may need to refresh or clear your cache to see the changes)\n\n ",

I will leave this issue open for a few days so people can post any problems w/ the new site w/o creating a new issue.\n\nI deprecated ant docs in the build.xml (the target still exists, but it now does nothing, so if anyone has automated dependencies on this, they will want to update them).  I removed <lucene>/site in favor of keeping the docs directory b/c I didn't know how people.apache.org would slurp up the website from a different directory and I didn't want to confuse people updating the website.  The instructions at http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/HowToUpdateTheWebsite have been modified accordingly.\n\nWe now have a favicon (yipee) that is checked in under the site src (<lucene>/src/site/src/documentation/content/xdocs/images) which is just the L part of the Lucene image file.\n\nI have not hooked in code coverage (Issue 721) or nightly builds (Issue 708) yet but hope to get to that soon.  I have not reverted the api docs to the last release, but will also try to get to that soon, as well.\n\nAs always, let me know of any issues.  Future changes should be in the form of patches.\n\nThanks,\nGrant ",
