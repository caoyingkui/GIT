    "description": "When you pass an executor to IndexSearcher, it creates a LeafSlice[] slices, by default once slice per leaf, but a subclass can override.\u00a0 It's helpful to later be able to get those slices e.g. if you want to do your own concurrent per-slice processing.\n\nThis\u00a0patch will just add a getter to IndexSearcher, and make the LeafSlice.leaves member public.",

If we are going to add a getter than this should be made private, otherwise the javadocs becomes 2x as confusing for really no good reason.\n\nadding access to the actual leaves makes sense. ",
