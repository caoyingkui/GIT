    "description": "When schemaless core index a json document. Solr will try to find field type based on first value. It is quite convenient, but sometime solr's detection is not match with json specification. For example, given a document\n\n{\n \"name\" : \"50\",\n \"star\" : 5\n}\n\n\nSolr will detect name, star as long field. But it quite trivial in json when a value is number or string. So name should be string field and star should be long field.",
