            "content": "Ran across a few more issues while fixing error handling issues. So I'll bundle those fixes into this ticket as well:\n\nFacetStream: was throwing NPE with zero facet results. TODO: add a test case for this. This effects the SQLHandler operating in facet aggregationMode.\n\nGatherNodesStream: explain was breaking on the admin stream console, due to issues with toExpression.\n\nCloudSolrStream: was throwing NPE on missing params rather then throwing proper exception. TODO: add test case for this.\n\nGraphHandler: did not have the SelectStream registered.\n\nOverall though the changes made in SOLR-8467 are looking good and the new admin stream console is working well.\n ",
