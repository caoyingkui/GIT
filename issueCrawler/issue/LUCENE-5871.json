            "content": "Version is currently used to decide whether to throw an exception in case IW has uncommitted or in-flight merges when you call close(), or silently discard them. I think that users who go to 5.0 will need to read the CHANGES carefully anyway, and adapt to the new way (close() only closes, not commit). I think we added it as convenience for users who upgrade and don't read CHANGES. But as you say, those users probably also pass Version.CURRENT, which means they silently lose those changes, so I now wonder if we should have this \"convenience\" in the code at all. And if we do decide to keep it, I suggest deprecating it in trunk, so it can be removed in e.g. 6.0. ",

I am suggesting replacing the logic depending on version with an explicit option in IWC.  It will default to current behavior (as if we saw LUCENE_5_0 currently), but can be set to use the semantics of 4x (commit on close).  ",

            "content": "I don't think this patch is correct. IndexWriter uses Version not in order to commitOnClose, but to throw an exception if you have uncommitted changes. You see, IndexWriter.close() no longer commits in trunk, it always discards uncommitted changes. The only difference is whether they are discarded silently or loudly.\n\nThat's why I said that this code should be either removed or deprecated in 5.0 and removed in 6.0. The only reason this code exists is that we want people who migrate from 4.x to 5.0 will not silently break their app if they didn't call commit() prior to close() (or called shutdown()). But I'm not sure these users will know to pass Version < 5.0 in order to set that behavior, unless they already do.\n\nAnyway, if we want to make this patch valid, we should name the setter something like setFailIfUncommittedChangesOnClose ...

Ie, by default close will wait for merges / commit, but you can disable this to make close == rollback by calling IWC.setCommitOnClose(false).\n\nIf we do this, I think we need to fix close to call shutdown(true) when commitOnClose is true, else rollback, and it no longer throws any exceptions about changes being lost.
