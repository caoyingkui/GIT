    "description": "There are sometimes good reasons to have a default set of timeouts for the httpclient, but utilize a different set of timeouts for individual requests.  You might want to have a 5 minute socket timeout for requests normally, which you set when you create the HttpClient object that the clients use ... but when you send an optimize request, or a particularly large update request, five minutes probably isn't going to be enough \u2013 you might want that request to have a 30 minute socket timeout instead.\n\nIf setting the timeout values is accomplished using parameters in the request (which get removed before sending to Solr) instead of adding a parameter to method signatures, then it could be utilized on all request types and even with a subset of the sugar methods, like SolrClient#query.",
