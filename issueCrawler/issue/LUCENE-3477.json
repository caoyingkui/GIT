Looks fine to me.\n\nRight, I too checked all of the locations, and as you say, all fall-throughs were to cases that were break-only.  This was likely intentionally generated code, rather than spookiness, and given that it's not intended to be user modifiable, probably not a problem or source of potential future problems.  That said, JFlex code generation should add breaks for emtpy/comment-only user-supplied action code, or at least turn off fallthrough warnings with a compiler directive.\n\nThe real problem here is the warnings, which Mike's patch fixes.  (Having to add \"naked\" breaks does seem weird, but it's functional.)\n\nI successfully regenerated from the .jflex sources (ant jflex under modules/analysis/common/, and all tests pass.\n\n+1 ",
