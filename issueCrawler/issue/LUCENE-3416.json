This patch looks fine to me though while I wonder why this needs to be synchronized since we don't read it from a synced block. if you want this to take immediate effect you should rather use volatile here?

If you don't want to set this concurrently how does a lock protect you from this? I mean you if you have two threads accessing this you have either A B or B A. but this would happen without a lock too. if you want to have the changes to take effect immediately you need to either lock on each read on this var or make it volatile which is almost equivalent (a mem barrier). \n\nMy concern here was related to make this var volatile which would be a cacheline invalidation each time you read the var.

As for reading the value, I think Mike logic was that its not that importnat the have \"immediate\" visibility of the change to require a volatile field (which is understandable). So, since setMaxMergeWriteMBPerSec is synchronized, the method added in this patch has to be as well.\n\n> My concern here was related to make this var volatile which would be a cacheline invalidation each time you read the var. I think we should get rid of the synchronized.\n\nReading a volatile var in x86 is not a cache invalidation, though it does come with a cost. Its not relevant here based on what I explained before (and second guessing Mike  ) ",

Yet since this is not intended here we don't need to get into details. Bottom line that synchronization doesn't make much sense here. we should try to control some order here that we can not control. if somebody sets either of those concurrently they should take care of synchronization. What should I expect if you set this concurrently? IMO we should craft those method to work without synchronization which is certainly possible. synchronized here buys us nothing and should be removed. ",

The minor added read cost should be negligible vs the overhead of creating / writing / closing files. ",

Since thats synchronized, the metod I added should be as well. Personally, I really don't think there is a need to make it thread safe without \"blocking\", since calling the \"setters\" is not something people do frequently at all, so the optimization is mute, and it will complicate the code.\n\nAs for making mergeWriteRateLimiter volatile, it can be done. Though, in practice, there really is no need to do it (there is a memory barrier when reading it before). But, I think that should go in a different issue? Just to keep changes clean and isolated? ",
