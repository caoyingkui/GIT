Let me know if I need to update the dependencies/version numbers anywhere.\n\nThe patch for Solr 3.x is in the works, we need to release JDK1.5-compatible version of some of the dependencies (HPPC) to make it happen.

I just wanted to update the version number of the Carrot2 dependency, but couldn't find any file referencing the old number (3.4.2). Now I see that the generated solr-clustering POM XML has carrot2-core as a dependency, but does not specify the exact version number. I guess there's some more Maven magic I need to learn to understand this  "
