    "description": "IndexWriter checks if the DV types are consitent in multiple places but if due to some problems in Elasticsearch users where able to add the same field with different DV types causing merges to fail. Yet I was able to reduce this to a lucene testcase but I was puzzled since it always failed. Yet, I had to run it without assertions and that cause the bug to happen. I can add field foo with BINARY and SORTED_SET causing a merge to fail. Here is a gist https://gist.github.com/s1monw/8707f924b76ba40ee5f3 / https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/8009 \n\nWhile this is certainly a problem in Elasticsearch Lucene also allows to corrupt an index due to user error which I think should be prevented. NOTE: this only fails if you run without assertions which I think lucene should do in CI once in a while too.",

We have existing tests that would have caught this bug had we already done this... ",

            "content": "OK one correction: even with assertions disabled, no existing Lucene test fails.  What's salient about Simon's test is 1) it opens a new IW, 2) the field is first added as a \"not doc values\" field (StringField).  Then when it's added also as a DocValuesField, it follows a different code path that relies on assert.\n\nAnyway I'll add Simon's test here, and upgrade the assert to a real check.  And I want to fix Lucene's tests to sometimes run w/o asserts. ",

I put one nocommit about whether the assert we use to verify TokenStream is final should be \"real\" (I think not?) ...\n\nIf the asserts fix is too much here, I can open a separate issue... ",
