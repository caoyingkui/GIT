    "description": "Some field types use associated types to store information.  For example, the CurrencyField uses a long and string field to store the amount and currency.  When constructing these associated types, the currency init function sets the type name on both field types (which it can do since it is in the same java package as FieldType).\n\nWhen the type name is not set, the LukeRequestHandler will get an NPE when trying to load the types (e.g when trying to view the schema browser, specifically when doing a Map.get with the type name, which is null).\n\nI think FieldType.setTypeName should be public instead of package private, or LukeRequestHandler should protect against a null type name (skipping it? since it is an implementation detail of a type in the schema?), or both.",
