So IP address needs a lookup\nYou are right about this. I was not aware of this.\nTurned out that a user could start Solr with -Dhost=someHostName.\nDoing the lookup as suggested is quite simple. However, 1 host could have multiple public and private IPs. We could pick the first public one or something...\n\nThis led me to start contemplating the idea of a more generic snitch that will deal with host names as well as IPs like\n192.168.1.2 -> host_1=2, host_2=1, host_3=168, host_4=192\nand\nserv1.dc1.london.uk.apache.org -> host_1=org, host_2=apache, host_3=uk, host_4=london, host_5=dc1, host_6=serv1 \n\nAny comment about this?\n\n\nLet's start from least significant to most significant\nYes, makes sense\n\n\nDo not blindly add a tag . Add if it is only requested\n\nThe current implementation adds only the tags that are requested.\nThe one that are not requested are not added to the response.\nThis is tested in \n\n\ttestGetTagsWithEmptyIPv4RequestedTag() where no tag is requested -> none returned, and\n\n\n\n\n\ttestGetTagsWithIPv4RequestedTags_ip_2_ip_4() where only 2 tags are requested leading to only 2 out of 4 being returned\n\n\n\n\nPlease let me know about the idea of a more generic snitch that could handle host names as well.\n\nMany thanks ",
