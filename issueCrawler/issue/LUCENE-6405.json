We rely on this almost completely for maintaining e.g. backwards compat codecs and keeping bugs out of the current ones.\n\nBut they don't test the exception handling. For the current codecs you shouldn't have to debug testThreadInterruptDeadLock or similar. And for the back compat codecs, its just completely untested.",
