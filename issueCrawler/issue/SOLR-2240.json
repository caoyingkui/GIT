    "description": "We intend to use stream.url for indexing documents from remote locations exposed through http.\nHowever, the remote urls are secured and would need basic authentication to be able access the documents.\nThe current implementation for stream.url in ContentStreamBase.URLStream does not support authentication.\n\nThe implementation with stream.file would mean to download the files to a local box and would cause duplicity, whereas stream.body would have indexing performance issues with the hugh data being transferred over the network.\n\nAn approach would be :-\n1. Passing additional authentication parameter e.g. stream.url.auth with the encoded authentication value - SolrRequestParsers\n2. Setting Authorization request property for the Connection - ContentStreamBase.URLStream\n    this.conn.setRequestProperty(\"Authorization\", \"Basic \" + encodedauthentication);\n\nAny thoughts ??",
