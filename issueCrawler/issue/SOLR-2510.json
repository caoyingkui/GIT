    "description": "The proximity search is incorrect on words occurring before the matching term. It matches documents that are less-than N words before and less-than-or-equal-to N words after.\n\nFor example, use the following document:\n   WORD_A WORD_B WORD_C WORD_D WORD_E WORD_F WORD_G\n\nExpected result: Both of the following queries should match:\n1) \"WORD_D WORD_G\"~3\n2) \"WORD_G WORD_D\"~3\n\nActual result: Only #1 matches. For some reason, it thinks the distance from D to G is 3, but from G to D is 4.",
