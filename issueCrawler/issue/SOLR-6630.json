    "description": "I had this exchange with an IRC user named \"kindkid\" this morning:\n\n\n08:30 < kindkid> I'm using sharding with the implicit router, but I'm seeing\n                 all my documents end up on just one of my 24 shards. What\n                 might be causing this? (4.10.0)\n08:35 <@elyograg> kindkid: you used the implicit router.  that means that\n                  documents will be indexed on the shard you sent them\nto, not\n                  routed elsewhere.\n08:37 < kindkid> oh. wow. not sure where I got the idea, but I was under the\n                 impression that implicit router would use a hash of the\n                 uniqueKey modulo number of shards to pick a shard.\n08:38 <@elyograg> I think you probably wanted the compositeId router.\n08:39 <@elyograg> implicit is not a very good name.  It's technically\ncorrect,\n                  but the meaning of the word is not well known.\n08:39 <@elyograg> \"manual\" would be a better name.\n\n\n\nThe word \"implicit\" has a very specific meaning, and I think it's\nabsolutely correct terminology for what it does, but I don't think that\nit's very clear to a typical person.  This is not the first time I've\nencountered the confusion.\n\nCould we deprecate the implicit name and use something much more\ndescriptive and easily understood, like \"manual\" instead?  Let's go\nahead and accept implicit in 5.x releases, but issue a warning in the\nlog.  Maybe we can have a startup system property or a config option\nthat will force the name to be updated in zookeeper and get rid of the\nwarning.  If we do this, my bias is to have an upgrade to 6.x force the\nname change in zookeeper.",

Renaming implicit will (hopefully) not directly impact a big chunk of the installed userbase.  A change to compositeId would have much greater user impact.\n\nThe rename of implicit will already be a far-reaching change that might come back to bite us in ways we never expected.  A rename of compositeId, if we do it at all, needs to be done later, after we figure out the pitfalls from THIS rename. ",

It also has nothing that can change the info in zookeeper from implicit to manual.\n\nThere is a problem with the patch that I don't know how to fix, I think it's a very old bug in subversion that nobody has figured out how to fix.  Actions like \"svn rename\" are not included in the diff, so this patch only shows the changes after these operations were done.  I used \"svn rename\" so that change history would be preserved.\n\nBefore you can apply and/or commit the patch, the rename must be complete and the original file must be present.  I think these steps will take care of that and make sure we don't lose history:\n\nMake a copy of ImplicitDocRouter.java, \"svn rename\" ImplicitDocRouter.java to ManualDocRouter,java, then use the OS to rename the copy back to ImplicitDocRouter.java.  Fixups like re-adding ImplicitDocRouter.java and redoing its svn:eol-style property are likely to be required. ",

Since my whole point was to eliminate ambiguity, I think that using that particular term is no better than \"implicit\".  I think that \"custom\" carries the same implication.\n\nSome of the suggestions put forth by Steve Rowe are intriguing.
