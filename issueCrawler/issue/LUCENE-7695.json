            "content": "This would have been better discussed on the mailing list first, I feel.\n\nI suspect what might be happening here is that one of the terms is hitting synonym expansion and perhaps that is not supported. This is strengthened by the fact that the words in the exception do not match the word you gave triggering it.\n\nSo, I would check the type definition, synonym file it uses and the synonyms in there. If I am right, the bigger question then is whether ComplexPhraseQueryParser is expected to support synonyms. If yes, then that would be the actual issue here. ",

About the words not matching, you are right, i copy/pasted another exception, i was looking for words and word combinations that do and do not cause trouble. Apologies for the confusion.\n\nThanks,\nMarkus ",
