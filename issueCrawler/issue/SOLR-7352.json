    "description": "CloudSolrStream currently collects the EOF Tuples from the underlying SolrStreams in an un-synchronized Map. \n\nThis ticket synchronizes this Map because of the following race condition:\n\nThe underlying SolrStream's are opened in parallel. If the first Tuple returned by two or more SolrStream's is an EOF Tuple, then a race condition will occur as the EOF Tuples are added to the Map.\n\nThe race condition only occurs if EOF tuples are returned during the opening of the SolrStreams (zero results returned). This is because the reading of SolrStreams is performed in a single thread, so if the initial Tuple returned is not an EOF Tuple no race condition is possible.",
