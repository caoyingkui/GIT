            "content": "Thanks Nick. I think having more javadocs would help but it looks great in general! Some notes:\n\n\twhy do we reject closed lines and point to polygons instead, shouldn't it be possible to index the outline of the polygon using lines rather than the area of the polygon using a polygon?\n\teven though I don't think it matters much for performance, it should be easy to only call encodeLat/encodeLon once per coordinate in the createIndexableFields methods, so maybe we should do it?\n\tLine's hashCode and equals don't need to take the min/max lats/lons into account since they are implicit from the list of coordinates?\n\tLet's choose either double[] Line#getLats or double getLat(int index) as a way to expose latitudes instead of having two ways to get latitudes/longitudes out of a line?\n\n ",
