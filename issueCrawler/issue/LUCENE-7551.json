    "description": "The PhraseQuery contains a list of terms and the positions for each term. The FVH ignores the term position and assumes that a phrase query is always dense. As a result phrase query with gaps are not highlighted at all. This is problematic for text fields that use a FilteringTokenFilter. This token filter removes tokens but preserves the position increment of each removal. \nBottom line is that using this token filter breaks the highlighting of phrase query that contains filtered tokens.",

            "content": "Might you try another highlighter?  I've spent a lot of time on the UnifiedHighlighter recently and it certainly isn't susceptible to this problem.  Furthermore, you can use offsets in postings instead of full term vectors to significantly reduce your index size while highlighting faster than FVH.  The UH was released in Lucene 6.3.0. ",
