    "description": "After benchmarking indexing speed on SOLR-3245, I ran a profiler and a couple things stood out.\n\nThere are other things I want to improve too, but these almost double the speed for many dictionaries.\n\n\n\tHunspell supports two-stage affix stripping, but the vast majority of dictionaries don't have any affixes that support it. So we just add a boolean (Dictionary.twoStageAffix) that is false until we see one.\n\tWe use java.util.regex.Pattern for condition checks. This is slow, I switched to o.a.l.automaton and its much faster, and uses slightly less RAM too.",
