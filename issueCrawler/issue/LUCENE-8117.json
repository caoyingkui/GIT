    "description": "DocValues are iterators now so old doc values (produced with Lucene54DocValues) also implements advance and advanceExact. Though sorted numerics produced by Lucene54DocValues are not working as expected when advanceExact is used. \nIn such case, the docValueCount is as expected but the values returned by the iterator for the document are invalid. This is due to a bug in the implementation of advanceExact in the producer that does not set the offset of the current doc when the function is used.",

            "content": "+1 patch looks good, great catch!\n\nI see we had some tests in CheckIndex for advanceExact, but they only check whether the return value is expected, not whether we then produce the expected values. Probably something we should look into beefing up, I'm now wondering some other codecs could have similar issues. ",
