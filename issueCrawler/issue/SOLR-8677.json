            "content": "Updated the patch with the changes to SolrJ that Shai suggested.  A few notes:\n\n\n\tSolrJ now throws an \"InvalidIdentifierException\" (extends IllegalArgumentException) when an invalid shard/core/collection/alias name is provided.  I wasn't sure whether it's acceptable to add a new thrown exception type, or if SolrJ had conventions around this.  Might be onerous to ask callers to add an additional catch block into their code.  But grepping through SolrJ's code, I saw a variety of exceptions being thrown, so I took that as a sign that I was \"in the clear\".\n\tThe existing identifier-validation logic (on the server side) threw a SolrException directly.  This makes sense on the server side, but less so in SolrJ.  So I created a client-side validation class to throw a more appropriate exception (InvalidIdentifierException, as mentioned above).  This obviously means some duplicated code, since the classes are largely the same other than the exception being thrown.  If anyone has suggestions on better ways to structure this, I'd love to hear them.\n\tI added tests for the additional SolrJ checks.  I had a hard time finding any tests for the Collection-API related types in SolrJ (CollectionAdminRequest).  So I created a new file for these tests (TestCollectionAdminRequest).  Wanted to mention it, in case tests for those classes do already exist, and I just missed them.  Pretty sure the new file was warranted though.\n\n\n\nHope this covers what you were looking for Shai!

This allows for throwing the appropriate exception from the calling code.\n\tRemoved the new Exception to just throw IllegalArgumentException directly.\n\n\n\nI didn't have any strong feelings about the new Exception but I didn't find it adding any value so I let go of it. I'm still running the tests but this should be fine I think. ",
