Someone would have to volunteer to be the release manager for, say, a 4.4.1 release or whatever and everyone's time is extremely limited.\n\nIt would be pretty straight forward for you to check out the code branch for 4.4, apply the patch locally and compile if it's important enough though.\n\nErick "
