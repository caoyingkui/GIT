            "content": "Perhaps instead of RPT throwing IllegalStateException, we do this pruning on a best effort basis.  The exception is quirky/unfriendly.  At the point this is thrown, we don't have a cell yet to check if it's an instanceof CellCanPrune.  Hmm.  Maybe RPT's constructor could grab the world cell to check for initializing pruneLeafyBranches appropriately.  What do you think?  recursiveTraverseAndPrune could also check to see if the cell is not an instanceof CellCanPrune and simply return false.\n\nYour patch has javadocs that references classes/methods plainly instead of using {@link ...} syntax.  Please correct them.  If/when they get renamed, IDEs will detect these.  IDEs also see them in find-usages.  At least this is true with IntellIJ. \n\nThe docs refer to \"They will be eligible for prune bunchy leaves\" but \"bunchy\" isn't the setting, it's \"leafy\".  Still, it'd be nicer to @-link the particular setting as mentioned above.  This approach would have avoided the misnomer as well (another reason to use {@link ...} in javadocs). ",

            "content": "Noted the issue with javadocs.\n\nI think there is some inconsistency how this property is treated. It seems it belongs to the cell but RPT strategy treats it as a property of the tree.\n\nI was thinking in a (probably non realistic) tree with mixed type of cells. They will not be treated as expected as it stops iterating at the first cell that does not implement the new interface.\n\nI am not sure if it is too aggressive but the logic should visit all cells regardless the type and stop when trying to prune if cell is not eligible not before. I attach a patch with the idea.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 ",
