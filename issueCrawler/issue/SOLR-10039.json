    "description": "The fastest and most efficient spatial field for point data in Lucene/Solr is LatLonPoint in Lucene's sandbox module.  I'll include LatLonDocValuesField with this even though it's a separate class.  LatLonPoint is based on the Points API, using a BKD index.  It's multi-valued capable.  LatLonDocValuesField is based on sorted numeric DocValues, and thus is also multi-valued capable (a big deal as the existing Solr ones either aren't or do poorly at it).  Note that this feature is limited to a latitude/longitude spherical world model.  And furthermore the precision is at about a centimeter \u2013 less precise than the other spatial fields but nonetheless plenty good for most applications.  Last but not least, this capability natively supports polygons, albeit those that don't wrap the dateline or a pole.\n\nI propose a LatLonPointSpatialField which uses this.  Patch & details forthcoming...\n\nThis development was funded by the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis as part of the HHypermap project",

I'm internally using a 6.4 based branch so the diff includes stuff that won't be needed for trunk or 6.5+.\n\nThe field extends AbstractSpatialFieldType and thus inherits the functionality and integration with the rest of Solr spatial.  The main TODOs are:\n\n\tmake indexed & docValues attributes configurable\n\tintegrate Polygon support.\n\n\n\nI would have liked to have introduced this embedded SpatialStrategy implementation to Lucene spatial-extras but I didn't think depending on sandbox was a good idea, at least not now, so I opted not to.
