    "description": "While working on SOLR-3699 i noticed that DirectoryFactory implements Closable (and thus: has a close() method) but (unless i'm missing something) never gets closed.\n\nI suspect the code that use to close() the DirectoryFactory got refactored into oblivion when SolrCoreState was introduced, and reloading a SolrCore started reusing the same DirectoryFactory.\n\nit seems like either DirectoryFactory should no longer have a close() method, or something at the CoreContainer level should ensure that all DirectoryFactories are closed when shuting down",
