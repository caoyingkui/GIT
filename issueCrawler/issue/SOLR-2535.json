Reason:\n\n    did not find a CONTENT object\n\njava.io.IOException: did not find a CONTENT object\n\n\n\nLooking at the code in class ShowFileRequestHandler, it seem like 3.1.0 should still handle directory listings if not file name is given, or if the file is a directory, so I am filing this as a bug.",

            "content": "The attached patch fixes this bug and adds new tests for a directory listing and getting a file. This bug was triggered with the introduction of SOLR-2263 in which RawResponseWriter was changed to implement BinaryQueryResponseWriter. This wasn't a problem in and of itself, but the SolrDispatchFilter checks if a response writer is the binary variant and if so calls the write(OutputStream...) variant. But the responses from ShowFileRequestHandler that list directory contents are incompatible with the RawResponseWriter if RawResponseWriter's write(OutputStream...) method is uses, instead of a character based stream. The solution was to move the defaulting of the \"raw\" response type from ShowFileRequestHandler.init() into into a condition within handleRequestBody() where it knows the response is a file. "
