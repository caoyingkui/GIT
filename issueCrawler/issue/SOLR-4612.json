            "content": "After a bit digging into the code, the problem appears to be: the CJKBigramFilter splits the provided into three parts (the code therefore raises the column-count to three), but since they belong all to the first word, the table later on uses html's colspan to make the relation clear. results in a table with three columns, where only the first one is used - because the first analyzer only gives one word. \n\nperhaps a combination with positionHistory would work, since that is later on used for the colspan magic, which i already mentioned ..

            "content": "looks like it could be done much easier than i initially thought.\n\nthe first item in the chain defines the upper limit of possible positions - and the count never gets higher than that.\n\nso to say, the position itself does, but the positionHistory never does - and this is what the UI relies on. simply example would be \"TvTv\" with a WDF, which gets split into two tokens but on the same position (read as positionHistory)\n\nworks at least for the given sample and a few others which i've tested randomly. needs a bit more testing to make sure that nothing gets broken w/ this patch.
