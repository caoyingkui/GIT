    "description": "We just upgraded from 4.2 to 4.8.1 and now run into an issue where added documents are not visible after doing a soft commit. Seems to be introduced by SOLR-5783. \n\nProblem manifests if conig explicitly sets nrtMode to false\n\nThe setup of the index is fairly simple; single core, no cloud, no replication, java program that adds a few rows, concludes with a softcommit, hardcommit is done via autoCommit few times an hour. Another (similar) index that uses autoSoftCommit instead of softcommitting via code has the same issue. Here is a snippet of the log:\n\n07:34:01.867 INFO  [qtp1520582600-1445       ] : o.a.s.u.processor.LogUpdateProcessor     - [PRD_KlwrDocAttrs] webapp=/solr path=/update params={wt=javabin&version=2} {add=[id-04114dd2-339e-4d2f-bb9f-539415799b1a (1470681570716155904), id-05eac67d-4f84-4c6f-b78f-714fe31eab40 (1470681570716155905), id-07559ff2-246c-4fde-9b97-0c5926348f62 (1470681570716155906), id-07cc0feb-b92d-41b8-9755-7677c9589af8 (1470681570716155907), id-11214665-9640-459d-804b-d9e3b069e8c2 (1470681570716155908), id-1147abeb-3dd5-4cda-b469-a99ebce913b4 (1470681570716155909), id-143f50b4-c195-480e-ab44-0ee4e7fbdc5c (1470681570716155910), id-14ad5b3e-1558-4bc6-a7a7-d2f03d1cd040 (1470681570717204480), id-168e810c-9a75-4e4f-84f4-946866cf0d26 (1470681570717204481), id-16de425b-0cd8-4bcd-98c1-6699c3de5112 (1470681570717204482), ...

(have to think about that more ... not sure if there's anything better we can do to in that case) "

IMO, it's like a cache size setting... it should not cause the external API to change.  From that perspective, one would want softCommit to just fall back to a normal commit.\n\nWe could also just get rid of the nrtMode parameter... or are there still use cases for it? "

            "content": "That nrtMode parameter does the trick. Elaboration on how it got there is quite short; when upgrading to 4.8 I diffed my solrconfig with the new one from the examples and noticed this parameter. I interpreted the comment quoted above as a hint to set it to true, since we run in master/slave setup. That means, for most cores we have a master/slave setup. For a few we query directly on the master and on those we had the issue. \n\nI can't add anything to the discussion about removing the param. If it can be removed cause it doesn't add anything (but confusion), I would vote for it. Regardless that param, I do think that if a user makes the effort to do a softcommit (or configure autosoftcommit), he'll do so because he wants the update to be visible after the commit. Having an extra configuration switch to confirm such behaviour is not intuitive I think.\n\nThanks for the quick solution! "

(off the top of my head, i can't even remember what that did under the covers before we had an nrtMode to open the searcher directly off the writer)\n\nobviously we'll need to get to the bottom of what the \"Right\" thing to do is moving forward, but it's good to know that removing nrtMode=false from your configs seems to be working with your master->slave setup and gives us a viable workarround in the mean time.\n\nif you run into any other problems using this setup, please file new bugs, but make sure to reference this one as well to help keep in mind that it may in fact be a replication+nrtMode+softcommit related issue.
