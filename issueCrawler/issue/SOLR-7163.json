Strange...)\n\nAnyway, while I did run a code snippet to verify my findings, I made a mistake and wrote something to the effect of double DEFAULT=Long.MAX_VALUE ; int MAX=(long)DEFAULT*1024*1024 instead of double DEFAULT=Long.MAX_VALUE ; int MAX=(long)(DEFAULT*1024*1024). The missing parantheses meant that the cast to long was done on DEFAULT instead of the full expression.\n\nFalse alarm. I apologize for the inconvenience. ",
