    "description": "Solr's default response format is still XML, despite the fact that Solr has supported the JSON response format for over a decade, developer mindshare has clearly shifted toward JSON over the years, and most modern/competing systems also use JSON format now by default.\n\nIn fact, Solr's admin UI even explicitly adds wt=json to the request (by default in the UI) to override the default of wt=xml, so Solr's Admin UI effectively has a different default than the API.\n\nWe have now introduced things like the JSON faceting API, and the new more modern /V2 apis assume JSON for the areas of Solr they cover, so clearly we're moving in the direction of JSON anyway.\n\nI'd like propose that we switch the default response writer to JSON (wt=json) instead of XML for Solr 7.0, as this seems to me like the right direction and a good time to make this change with the next major version.\n\nBased upon feedback from the Lucene Dev's mailing list, we want to:\n1) Change the default response writer type to \"wt=json\" and also change to \"indent=on\" by default\n2) Make no changes on the update handler side; it already works as desired (it returns the response in the same content-type as the request unless the \"wt\" is passed in explicitly).\n3) Keep the /query request handler around since people have already used it for years to do JSON queries\n4) Add a commented-out \"wt=xml\" to the solrconfig.xml as a reminder for folks on how to change (back) the response format.\n\nThe default format change, plus the addition of \"indent=on\" are back compat changes, so we need to make sure we doc those clearly in the CHANGES.txt. There will also need to be significant adjustments to the Solr Ref Guide, Tutorial, etc.",

In short, SolrTestCaseJ4 has XPath checking hard-coded in its design, so I need to now pass in wt=xml explicitly there, and there are a handful of test suites (i.e. replication/backup/restore and hdfs) that are explicitly checking XML strings and looping forever until they get those strings back (hence timing out).\n\nI'm making changes to explicitly request XML right now for those tests where they are expecting it and will get a patch posted hopefully today.

I have an updated patch which fixes some (now) merge conflicts with the default configset changes, and all tests appear to be passing except the TestHierarchicalDocBuilder.testThreeLevelHierarchy one. I still haven't been able to dig deep enough to understand what is effecting that one.\n\nI DO know that the issues is related to indention. If I go into the test and override it to \"indent=off\" then it succeeds, but I have no idea why indention being on is causing the failure. Also, doing that in the test is probably just masking another underlying problem, which may not even be test related, so I really need to understand exactly where things are breaking down to know if it's a test problem or an actual functionality problem somewhere.\n\nAt any rate, I'll post my updated patch here shortly.
