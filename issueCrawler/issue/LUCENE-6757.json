    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-6745 suggested by Robert Muir.\n\nIt's dangerous today that Directory.openInput returns an IndexInput which you can then use for IO but also clone so other threads can do thread-private IO.\n\nWe could instead make this strongly typed, e.g. Directory.openInput returns a thingy (Handle, Descriptor, something) whose sole purpose is to 1) produce IndexInput for thread-private use, and 2) close.\n\nIn the meantime, we could add some simple asserts to MDW to detect if the \"original\" IndexInput is ever use for anything but cloning, when other threads have cloned / do clone in the future.  I'll explore that first ... it's a start.",
