The metadata does show and refreshes when selecting this or other files, but the content area stays blank or continues to show the content of the previously selected files.\n\nThis might be related to an issue whereby IE does not show the data-import status when doing an import. \n\nBoth the above issues are not present in the 'original UI'",
