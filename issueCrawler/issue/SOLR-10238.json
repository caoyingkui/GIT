    "description": "LatLonPointSpatialField is about to land in SOLR-10039.  This field is superior to LatLonType.  In 7.0, lets remove LatLonType and mark it deprecated in 6.x?  Or must this wait yet another release cycle?\n\nFYI RPT fields still have life in them due to their ability to index non-point shapes, handle custom (user coded ) shapes, and heatmaps, and are not limited to a lat-lon coordinate space.",
