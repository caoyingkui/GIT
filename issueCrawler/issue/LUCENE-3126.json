    "description": "Today, IW.addIndexes(Directory) does not modify the CFS-mode of the incoming segments. However, if IndexWriter's MP wants to create CFS (in general), there's no reason why not turn the incoming non-CFS segments into CFS. We anyway copy them, and if MP is not against CFS, we should create a CFS out of them.\n\nWill need to use CFW, not sure it's ready for that w/ current API (I'll need to check), but luckily we're allowed to change it (@lucene.internal).\n\nThis should be done, IMO, even if the incoming segment is large (i.e., passes MP.noCFSRatio) b/c like I wrote above, we anyway copy it. However, if you think otherwise, speak up .\n\nI'll take a look at this in the next few days.",

Should we consider it a violation (that's what happens today if you try it)? I personally think that this is not a common (or even expected) scenario, and therefore javadocs is enough, but if others think this is a violation, then we should fix it - we'll need to 'open' the CFS into its individual files.

You create them by opening a writable IndexReader (I know: confusing!) and calling setNorm, then closing it.
