    "description": "Scorer currently has to implement a whole bunch of methods that are never called.  The only method that Scorer uses in addition to the methods on DocIdSetIterator is freq(), and as currently implemented this means different things on different Scorers:\n\n\tTermScorer returns its underlying termfreq\n\tMinShouldMatchScorer returns how many of its subscorers are matching\n\t{Exact|Sloppy}\nPhraseScorer returns how many phrases it has found on a document\n\n\n\nIn addition, freq() is never actually called on TermScorer, and it's only used in explain() on the phrase scorers.\n\nWe should make Scorer extend DocIdSetIterator instead.  In place of freq(), Scorer would have a coord() method that by default returns 1, and for boolean scorers returns how many subscorers are matching.",

            "content": "Patch.  I also added a PhraseScorer abstract class with a phraseFreq() method that PhraseWeight.explain() calls.\n\nThere are a couple of tests that walk the Scorer tree and check that TermScorers return the correct freq() which I think we can just nuke?  Seeing as TermScorer.freq() is literally called nowhere else in the codebase.\n\nAlternatively, we could keep the existing freq() implementations for backwards-compatibility purposes, deprecating them in 5x and removing in trunk.
