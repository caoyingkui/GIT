As Java 8 is now officially released and supported, smoketester should now use and require JAVA8_HOME.\n\nFor the nightly-smoke tests I have to install the openjdk8 FreeBSD package, but that should not be a problem.",

In order to get original info, I tried to use these SHA data to track commits. First, I cloned Lucene repository to my local host, using the cmd git clone https:// https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr.git. Then, I used git show [commit SHA] to get commits\u2019 history record, but failed with the CMD info like this:\n        >> git show be5672c0c242d658b7ce36f291b74c344de925c7\n        >> fatal: bad object be5672c0c242d658b7ce36f291b74c344de925c7\n        After that, I cloned another mirror of Apache Lucene & Solr (https://github.com/mdodsworth/lucene-solr, the update ended at 2014/08/30), and got the right record like this:\n\n    ![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30914694/32547322-df350a26-c4bc-11e7-83a7-fe013ae7c528.png)\n\n        Moreover, I tried to track a commit using its title msg. However, for a same commit, e.g. LUCENE-5909: Fix stupid bug, I found different SHA nums from the two above mirror repositories (https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/3c0d111d07184e96a73ca6dc05c6227d839724e2 and https://github.com/mdodsworth/lucene-solr/commit/4bc8dde26371627d11c299f65c399ecb3240a34c), which confused me.\n        In summary, 1) did the method to generate SHA num of commit change once before? 2) because the second mirror repository ended its update since 2014, how can I track the whole commits of my dataset?\n       Thanks so much!\n    ( I do not know is it a right way to contact  @apache. ) ",
