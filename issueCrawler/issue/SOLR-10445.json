    "description": "BloomFilteringPostingsFormat$BloomFilteredFieldsProducer$BloomFilteredTermsEnum does not reuse the TermState from the initial lookup when a second seek is issued (usually when we have a match and we build the Scorer). \n\nDefault implementation of TermsEnum#seekExact(BytesRef term, TermState state) that is used by BF calls the regular seekExact method. \n\nThis means that the BloomFilteringPostingsFormat default implementation performs a second lookup for every segment/field that have a match for the term (mostly in the various Weight#scorer implementations).\n\nI don't think it is a big issue as we mostly expect search terms to have a match in a limited number of segment/field. But for few queries it could become inefficient.",
