    "description": "In LUCENE-3930 we're implementing some less than ideal solutions to make available the unreleased version of commons-csv.  We could remove these solutions if we didn't rely on this lib.  So I think we should explore alternatives. \n\nI think opencsv is an alternative to consider, I've used it in many commercial projects.  Bizarrely Commons-CSV's website says that Opencsv uses a BSD license, but this isn't the case, OpenCSV uses ASL2.",
