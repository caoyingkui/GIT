    "description": "A tricky situation, for sure, but I suspect in data-driven mode, when field guessing, we should treat multi-word strings as text by default, not String, so that the user's first experience is they can search against that field.\n\nAlternatively, create a second field that is either the String version or the Text version.\n\nEven more advanced option: use pseudo-fields (like what we do for some spatial) and intelligently use one or the other depending on the context: e.g. faceting uses the one form, search uses the other.",
