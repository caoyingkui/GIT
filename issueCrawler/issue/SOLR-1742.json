            "content": "Hey Marcin,\n\nYou should be able to use int (or sint) no problem. When you see the error \"missing core name in path\", thats often an indication you need to check your logs (especially if you are running single core) - look for the first error, timewise, that you can find. In this case you will see: the QueryElevationComponent requires a String id field. If you remove the QueryElevationComponent/Handler, you should no longer see \"missing core name in path\" and Solr will start up.\n\n\n\tMark\n\n "
