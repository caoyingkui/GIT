    "description": "Mark Miller wrote on the dev list:\n\n\nI'd like it for some things if we actually kept the versions somewhere else - for instance, Hadoop dependencies should match across the mr module and the core module.\n\nPerhaps we could define versions for dependencies across multiple modules that should probably match, in a prop file or ant file and use sys sub for them in the ivy files.\n\nFor something like Hadoop, that would also make it simple to use Hadoop 1 rather than 2 with a single sys prop override. Same with some other depenencies.",

            "content": "Patch implementing the idea.\n\nIntroduces lucene/ivy-versions.properties, included in lucene/ivy-settings.xml, where all dependency versions are stored as properties of the form: /org/name = rev, e.g. /commons-io/commons-io = 2.1.  There are two shared revs: jetty.version and hadoop.version, which are included in and interpolated as revs in lucene/ivy-versions.properties.\n\nI thought about using Maven coordinate-style syntax, with a colon between the dependency's org and its name, but colons have to be escaped in property file syntax, since the colon a metachar equivalent to '=', so it looked clunky.  The path-ish slash style works everywhere I tried it, including as cmdline sysprops.  And it provides a sort of namespace for these properties.\n\nI also switched to loading lucene/ivy-versions.properties in the -check-forbidden-java-apis target in solr/build.xml, to access the commons-io:commons-io version, used in locating the appropriate definitions file.\n\nThis patch also effectively upgrades the httpcomponents dependencies in the lucene/replicator module to the versions used in Solr; the required checksums are swapped in under lucene/licenses/.\n\nant precommit and ant test both pass after I rm $(find . -name '*.jar').\n\nI'll commit in a day or so if there are no objections.
