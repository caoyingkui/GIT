            "content": "It is: basically the reason TestBoolean2.testRandomQueries fails is not the comparison with BS1, but instead the fact the score differs from the explanation.\n\nHowever, see the latest patch, its way more thorough because it means we sometimes use a coord() like this across a host of tests.\nSo with the latest patch's tests, if you revert the fix, many tests fail such as TestPhraseQuery.testPhraseQueryInConjunctionScorer, TestFilteredQuery, etc.\n\nBut the first test is good for 3.6, since we don't have this Similarity randomization there.
