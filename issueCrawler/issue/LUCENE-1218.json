    "description": "The PassTokenizer passes a text in a TokenStream that has a single token in its stream.\n\nThis Tokenizer(attached) is very useful for debugging. You may test TokenFilter that will do sub-tokenization in a token. This Tokenizer is also useful for debugging the tokenization process dependent on the TokenFilter order.\n\nThis Tokenizer is not suitable for processing a large text field.",
