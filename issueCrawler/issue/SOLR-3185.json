Query analysis will give the expected result of \n\nA&B\n\n. I examined the index with both standalone Luke and the schema browser field and the index value is incorrect in both tools.\n\nThis is the affected charFilter:\n\n<charFilter class=\"solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory\"\n                    pattern=\"(^\\w)\\s[&amp;]\\s(\\w)\"\n                    replacement=\"$1&amp;$2\" />",

Also, can you quote the XML verbatim? If you have this:\n\n\n<charFilter class=\"solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory\" \n                    pattern=\"(^\\w)\\s[&amp;]\\s(\\w)\" \n                    replacement=\"$1&amp;amp;$2\" />\n\n\nthen indeed the replaced value will be:\n\n$1&amp;$2\n\n "
