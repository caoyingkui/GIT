    "description": "When a SegmentTermPositions object is reset via seek() it does not move\nthe proxStream to the correct position in case the term is the first one\nin the dictionary.\n\nThe reason for this behavior is that the skipStream is only moved if\nlazySkipPointer is != 0. But 0 is a valid value for the posting list of\nthe very first term. The fix is easy: We simply have to set lazySkipPointer\nto -1 in case no lazy skip has to be performed and then we only move the\nskipStream if lazySkipPointer!=-1.",
