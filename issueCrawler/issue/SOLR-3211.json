    "description": "A couple users on the mailing list recently asked about being able to override the \"mm\" parameter when SpellCheckComponent issues queries to check for # hits for a collation candidate.  The issue is if the query had mm=0, pretty much everything will generate hits.  But for collation checking purposes, a low \"mm\" is almost never desirable.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to generalize this to let other parameters be overridden as well.",

            "content": "Here is a patch for this with a unit test.\n\nThis creates a new parameter syntax: spellcheck.collateParam.xx  where \"xx\" is the parameter you are overriding.  Typically users would want to override \"mm\" from a low value to a high value so that the spellchecker is truly verifying that the replacement (collation) terms exist together in the same document.  I made this more general in case users wanted to override something different (perhaps \"q.op\").\n\nI would like to commit this one in a few days or so... "
