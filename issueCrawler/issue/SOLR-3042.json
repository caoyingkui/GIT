    "description": "The maven jetty plugin is very popular and useful because it allows you to run a web application with a trivial command line execution \"mvn jetty:run\" and without setting up a servlet engine or deploying your app to it.  Perhaps more importantly, it allows fast debug cycles in development.  The plugin is misconfigured right now and I'm told its pedigree was a copy-paste from somewhere \u2013 it was never verified to work.  Attached is a patch that configures it properly.  There's not much to it.",

This means, though, that the velocity contrib will be included in the Maven-built war, unlike the Ant-built war, and I want to avoid differences like this.\n\nAn alternative (works for me) is to add a <systemProperty> setting to the maven-jetty-plugin configuration in the webapp POM:\n\n\n<systemProperty>\n  <name>solr.velocity.enabled</name>\n  <value>false</value>\n</systemProperty>\n\n\n\nDavid, what do you think?
