    "description": "We propose a new type of LBHttpSolrClient which uses UCB algorithm to select a next candidate from replicas.\nThis new client uses past responses (currently, only QTime) to calculate the priority of each replica, and selects the best one for keeping the stability of latencies.\n\nOur experiment shows that the new client performed better than LBHttpSolrClient with failure cases such as the performance of one node goes down by some reasons.\nPlease see attached PDF for more details.",
