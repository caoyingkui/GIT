    "description": "from the dev@lucene list...\n\n\nSubject: Re: Performance hit of Solr checkIntegrityAtMerge\n\nThere are two costs: cpu and i/o.\n\nThe cpu cost is not much anyway but can be made basically trivial by\nusing java 8.\nThe i/o cost is because the check is not done with any i/o locality to\nthe data being merged. so it could be a perf hit for an extremely\nlarge merge.\n\nIn 5.0 the option is removed: we reworked this computation in merging\nto always have locality and so on, the checking always happens.\n\n...but on the 5x branch, the checkIntegrityAtMerge setting (and comments) still exist in the example configs, and the SolrIndexConfig code still parses it (but does nothing with it since IWC no longer accepts it as an option)\n\ntodo..\n\n\tremove setting form example configs (runk & 5x)\n\tupdate code to check if the setting is used & log a warning that it's now ignored\n\t\n\t\tbackport this to 5x\n\t\n\t\n\tupdate code (trunk only) to completely remove parsing of this setting",
