    "description": "When opening a new CloudSolrServer against an unavailable zookeeper ensemble, the following exception messages are logged:\n\n\nINFO  [hybrisHTTP28-SendThread(localhost:2181)] [ClientCnxn] Opening socket connection to server localhost/127.0.0.1:2181. Will not attempt to authenticate using SASL (unknown error)\nWARN  [hybrisHTTP28-SendThread(localhost:2181)] [ClientCnxn] Session 0x0 for server null, unexpected error, closing socket connection and attempting reconnect\njava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused\n\tat sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.checkConnect(Native Method)\n\tat sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.finishConnect(SocketChannelImpl.java:692)\n\tat org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocketNIO.doTransport(ClientCnxnSocketNIO.java:350)\n\tat org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$SendThread.run(ClientCnxn.java:1068)\nINFO  [hybrisHTTP28-SendThread(localhost:2181)] [ClientCnxn] Opening socket connection to server localhost/127.0.0.1:2181.
