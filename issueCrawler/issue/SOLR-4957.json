            "content": "Comments about the specific problems found so far - there are other problems I'll add in other comments.\n\nlink checker plugin isn't installed/working \n\nThe page to check links needs two plugins to really use it:\n\n\tReporting Plugin. This is a free plugin in Confluence 3.5.x, but moves to a pay model in Confluence 4.x+. Once the Confluence upgrade is complete, this will stop working again until ASF infra figures out the licensing for it, if they intend to do that. It basically provides the structure of the page with page titles, links to pages, and the links on those pages that either pass/fail the link check.\n\tLink Validator Plugin: this is free, even after Confluence 4 & 5. However, the only thing it does on its own is check the link it's given. It's the reporting plugin that actually goes through all the pages to find the links to feed into the link validator. Without the reporting plugin, all links need to be fed into this plugin manually.\n\n\n\nThe report works OK - it's better than not having one at all, but it isn't perfect. It often reports links as bad or unknown when they work just fine, but I've only rarely seen it report a link as good that wasn't good. It checks all the links every time the page is loaded, so if people are hitting it often, I suspect that might cause a performance issue (not a major one for occasional use - but if 100s or 1000s of users are loading the page every day, I wouldn't be surprised to hear of a problem). In LucidWorks documentation, I hide the link check page to everyone but myself, so if those plugins are installed, page permissions should be set to a limited group.\n\nUnable to render embedded object: File (external-link-grey-gradient02.png) not found.\n\nBah, my fault. At one time I had a little icon next to links as an indicator that the link went somewhere other than another page of the Solr Ref Guide (like, the link went to the Solr Wiki). It didn't export well into PDF at all - it put the icon on it's own line instead of next to the link like it was supposed to - so I later decided to remove it. I thought I'd scrubbed the pages more thoroughly, but it looks like I didn't finish that before I exported. All you need to do is add the little icon to the root page for now. Or, to remove it entirely it's used exclusively in the Related Topics sections of the pages it appears on (i.e., I never used it in the middle of a paragraph, only in the lists of related links at the bottom of some pages).\n\nThe icon came from this site: http://www.shapes4free.com/vector-icons/external-link-icons/. I was going to upload the graphic here, but I checked the license and it said not to upload it to another website. However, the graphics are free to use without attribution or backlinks. Here is the full license: http://www.shapes4free.com/license/.\n\nUnknown macro: {topofpage}\n\nThat's a simple user macro that could be added. It adds HTML to the page to link back to the top of a page, which is helpful for very long pages. An alternative would be to just split those pages into smaller ones. Or, the macro could easily be replaced with HTML code in the page, but for me a macro is easier to use and remember. This one only works with the Documentation Theme, which is what the Solr Ref Guide is using now. \n\nIn Confluence 3.5.x, go to User Macros in the Confluence Admin. Enter a name, description, visibility to users, and what category it should appear in if someone is browsing through the macro browser. Then select \"No macro body\" under \"Macro Body Processing\", then HTML for \"Output Format\". In the Template section add '<p style=\"text-align:right\"><a href=\"#main\">Back to Top</a></p>'. Save and it's done.\n\nIn my tests, this converts fine with the upgrade to Confluence 4+ and the new storage format. Because the higher Confluence versions are storing pages in XHTML, and this is already HTML, there's no problem. The only thing that might need to be modified is to add a line before the HTML code that says '## @noparams'. I'm still learning these things in Confluence 4, but I believe that says the macro has no parameters for a user to respond to and is required for macros with no parameters.\n\nNote, if a different space theme is used, the href target in the HTML would need to be changed to '#content' instead of '#main'.

It sets the font in the PDF export to a unicode font to properly render some of the more complex language examples on that page. At LucidWorks, our PDF font is Verdana, which does not properly render Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Persian and Thai. This macro sets a CSS class for those snippets of text that didn't render right, and the CSS for the PDF uses that class to set the font as Arial Unicode. If you use a Unicode font as the body for the whole PDF, you can remove the references to this macro. If you use an even less-unicode-compatible font than Verdana, you may need to expand the use of the macro.\n\nThis macro had problems in my test conversion to Confluence 4, but I have not yet had a chance to look at what the problems were or if they are easy to fix.\n\n "
