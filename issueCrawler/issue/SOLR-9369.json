    "description": "Today the replication code we compare if two replicas are in sync by checking the commit timestamp ( \"commitTimeMSec\" ) \n\nThis made sense for master slave but I don't think is useful for SolrCloud since different replicas will commit at different times. We should not check for this in SolrCloud mode.\n\nRamkumar noted this on SOLR-7859 as well.",

            "content": "Here is a scenario where in SolrCloud this would help short-circuit replication slightly faster\n\nAssuming we have 1 shard , 2 replicas - replica 1 being the leader and replica2 being the follower\n\n1. Index s few documents\n2. Replica2 goes down\n3. Index more than 100 documents - ( PeerSync default )\n4. Replica2 comes up and ends up doing a full replication\n5. Replica2 does down\n6. Replica2 comes up\n\nIn step 6, if we have the 'commitTimeMSec' then solr short-circuits saying both indexes are in sync. \n\nIf we were to remove 'commitTimeMSec' , then the replica has to download the file list from the leader and be able to say that its in sync. So it would save one step in this case.\n\nBut this would be rare as indexes generally aren't static ",
