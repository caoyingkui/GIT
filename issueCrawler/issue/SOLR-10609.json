    "description": "This patch introduces a new stage that is performed between STAGE_START and STAGE_PARSE_QUERY.\n\nIn QueryComponent the PARSE_QUERY stage does some preparatory work before the query can be run rather than parsing the query. This patch proposes replacing that stage in QueryComponent with STAGE_PREPROCESSING.\u00a0\n\nIn future this stage could be extended to perform analysis on a request before all the components start processing it, and then abort execution if the request is believed to be too costly.",
