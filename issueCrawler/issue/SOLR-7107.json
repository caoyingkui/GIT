The bin/post script will be changed from crawling http://lucidworks.com to http://lucene.apache.org\n\nHowever, there are some bad 500 errors from Tika complaining about not well-formed HTML code on our site, so I'm committing some CMS fixes for that first.",

I don't know the history of this, was it intentional? I tried to fix it, but it's a bit confusing.\n\nI think we're fine if all templates referred to from lib/path.pm have <html> tags added, and that none of them include eachother. Currently, core.html is both a top-page and also included from mirrors-core-latest-redir.html and mirrors-core-redir.html for some reason.\n\nTo reproduce the crawl errors:\n\nbin/post -c gettingstarted http://lucene.apache.org/core/corenews.html\n\n ",
