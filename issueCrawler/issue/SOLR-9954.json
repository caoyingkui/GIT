    "description": "While configuring the HdfsBackupRepository to use Google compute storage, I misconfigured the permissions on my bucket. Unfortunately, the exception that would have pointed me in the right direction gets squelched by the finally block in createSnapshot:\n\n\n    } finally {\n      if (!success) {\n        backupRepo.deleteDirectory(snapshotDirPath);\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\nIf there's a permissions issue, then the deleteDelectory is going to fail and raise another exception from the finally block, which swallows the original exception. For example:\n\n\nERROR - 2017-01-10 18:38:52.650; [c:gettingstarted s:shard1 r:core_node1 x:gettingstarted_shard1_replica1] org.apache.solr.handler.SnapShooter; Exception while creating snapshot\njava.io.IOException: GoogleHadoopFileSystem has been closed or not initialized.\n    at com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystemBase.checkOpen(GoogleHadoopFileSystemBase.java:1927)\n    at com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystemBase.delete(GoogleHadoopFileSystemBase.java:1255)\n    at org.apache.solr.core.backup.repository.HdfsBackupRepository.deleteDirectory(HdfsBackupRepository.java:160)\n    at org.apache.solr.handler.SnapShooter.createSnapshot(SnapShooter.java:234)\n    at org.apache.solr.handler.SnapShooter.lambda$createSnapAsync$1(SnapShooter.java:186)\n    at org.apache.solr.handler.SnapShooter$$Lambda$89/43739789.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n\n\n\nThat's merely the symptom and not the actual cause of the failure.",
