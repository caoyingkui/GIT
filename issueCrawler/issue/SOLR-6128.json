If there's no problem then the log level should be INFO or even better DEBUG, but not WARN. Warning means there may be a problem. So you should either reopen this issue and fix the log level or tell us how can we avoid the WARN messages. These kind of \"informative harmless\" messages as you call them can make your life miserable when you have a problem and you need to filter the log for the real cause.\n\nNote that the above messages are still logged after I removed the 'managed_en' field type from schema.xml (and re-indexed of course).
