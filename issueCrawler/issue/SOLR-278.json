    "description": "the soon to be attached patch adds a method to LukeRequest to set the option for showing schema from SOLR-266.  the patch also modifies LukeRepsonse to handle the schema info in the same manner as the fields from the 'normal' luke response.  i think it's worth talking about unifying the response format so that they aren't different but that's a larger discussion.",

We could be even merge the two if\nit made sense.\n\nIn the end I need to get a list of \"fields that solr currently knows\nabout\" which seems to be a grouping of both the schema and the index via\ndynamic fields.  The current patch does this but I think there is a\nbetter approach somewhere out there.\n\n\n\twill\n\n\n "
