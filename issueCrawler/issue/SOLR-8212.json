    "description": "Noticing some inconsistent behavior with the Standard Highlighter and its function on terms that use the NGram Tokenizer. Ex: \nI created a field called \"title_contains\" which uses the NGram Tokenizer and I indexed the term \"bronchoscopy\". Querying \"co\" on the title_contains field should return \"bronchos<em>co</em>py\", but the Standard highlighter returns \"bronchoscopy\" without the highlighting information.\nI created a test called testNgram() which tests the above example using (1) the Standard Highlighter on the ngram field type and (2) the Fast Vector Highlighter on the ngram field type. The first fails and the second passes. \n\n\nProblem identified: MAX_NUM_TOKENS_PER_GROUP = 50 (in TokenGroup.Java) and for some terms numTokens >=50...this causes incorrect match start and end offsets and therefore no highlighting on found term.",

Terms with query contained farther in word (bronchos*co*py, blood *ca*ncer, etc) end up having 50+ tokens and therefore private int matchStartOffset and private int matchEndOffset are not calculated correctly in void addToken() and entire term eventually returned with no formatting.
