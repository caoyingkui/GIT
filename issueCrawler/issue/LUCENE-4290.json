It actually scores each passage as if it were its own hit/document matching a search?

The former i think is\nno longer necessary and the latter is probably overkill.\n\n\nThis isn't just a cutover from term vectors to postings right? It actually scores each passage as if it were its own hit/document matching a search? Ie the passage ranking/selection differs from the two existing highlighters.\n\nRight: I think its different in a number of ways. I hope it should be really fast: but\nagain I didnt even bother benchmarking yet.\n\nIts also limited in some ways since its just a prototype. ",
