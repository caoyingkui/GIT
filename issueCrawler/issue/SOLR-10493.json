    "description": "May be related to my recent check-in for SOLR-10007. This test does fail prior to that (Steve Rowe beasted and checked with 10007 rolled back and sent me error logs), but the failures he reports are significantly different than I was seeing with 10007. Since I was certainly in the core reload code and the reports with SOLR-10007 mention core reloading but the ones without SOLR-10007 do NOT mention core reloading it's suspicious enough to spend some time on.",
