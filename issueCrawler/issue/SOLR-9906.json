    "description": "Tests LeaderFailureAfterFreshStartTest and PeerSyncReplicationTest currently rely on number of requests made to the leader's replication handler to check if node recovered via PeerSync or replication. This check is not very reliable and we have seen failures in the past. \n\nWhile tinkering with different way to write a better test I found SOLR-9859. Now that SOLR-9859 is fixed, here is idea for better way to distinguish recovery via PeerSync vs Replication. \n\n\n\tFor PeerSyncReplicationTest, if node successfully recovers via PeerSync, then file replication.properties should not exist\n\n\n\nFor LeaderFailureAfterFreshStartTest, if the freshly replicated node does not go into replication recovery after the leader failure, contents replication.properties should not change",
