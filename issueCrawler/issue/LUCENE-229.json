Can be used for a variety of applications from compressed text storage,\nimage storage or as a basis for implementing typed storage (e.g: Integers,\nFloats, etc.)\n\nBased on discussion from lucene-dev list started here:\nhttp://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=lucene-dev&m=108455161204687&w=2\n\nDirectly based on design fleshed out here:\nhttp://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=lucene-dev&m=108456898230542&w=2\n\nPatch includes updated code and unit tests not included in the patch sent do the\nlucene-dev list.",
