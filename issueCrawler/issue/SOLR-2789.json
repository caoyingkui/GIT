    "description": "I noticed that the showItems parameter for cache configuration applies to FastLRUCache but not LRUCache.  So I added it.  I also noticed that the key data about an item that is QueryResult cache hit wasn't very useful, but was for document and filter cache, so added specific support for QueryResultKey.\n\nThis patch should probably be merged with the work in SOLR-1893, which is a proposed refactor.  I'm happy to merge these two into a single patch if someone things that is a good idea.\n\nThe output for a queryresult cache hit now looks like:\n\n<str name=\"cumulative_hitratio\">0.66</str>\n<long name=\"cumulative_inserts\">43</long>\n<long name=\"cumulative_evictions\">0</long>\n<str name=\"item_QueryResultKey:-1058088364(query=text:efficient, filters=[manu:\"apple computer inc\"], sort=null)\">org.apache.solr.search.DocSlice@1e66a917</str>\n<str name=\"item_QueryResultKey:-425423228(query=text:based, filters=[inStock:T], sort=null)\">org.apache.solr.search.DocSlice@7bfcb845</str>\n\nI've also updated the example solrconfig.xml in order to better show off the showItems parameter.",
