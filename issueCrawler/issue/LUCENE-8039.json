    "description": "The current \"distance\" method for a path returns a distance computed along the path and then perpendicular to the path.  But, at least in the case of paths, it is often preferable to compute a \"delta\" distance, which would be the minimum straight-line distance assuming a diversion to reach the provided point.\n\nA similar \"distance delta\" for a circle would be defined as returning a number exactly the same as is currently returned, with the understanding that the point given would be the destination and not a new waypoint.  Similarly, the distance beyond the end of a path to the provided point would be counted only once, while the distance before the beginning of the path would be counted twice (one leg to the point, and the other leg back from that point to the start point (or nearest path point, if closer).\n\nThis obviously must be implemented in a backwards-compatible fashion.",

            "content": "The proposal would be to add another method to GeoDistance: computeDeltaDistance, with associated implementations and default implementations.\n\nThe delta could be computed one of two ways:\n\n(1) As a perpendicular excursion from the route\n(2) As a straight-line addition of another waypoint on the route\n\nThe first approach is consistent with everything else we've done here, and is consistent with the notion of the specified point being reachable primarily through the route itself.   The second approach is probably unrealistic except when the corridor is rather wide.\n\nI am also reconsidering whether an excursion beyond the endpoint of the route should be counted as a round trip \u2013 I think it probably should be.\n ",
