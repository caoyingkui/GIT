    "description": "In the following commit, the value of the parameter set in SnapPuller changed from \"true\" to \"internal\":\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/trunk/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/SnapPuller.java?r1=1353888&r2=1353889&\n\nSpecifically, this line:\n  formparams.add(new BasicNameValuePair(COMPRESSION, \"true\"));\nWas changed to this:\n  params.set(COMPRESSION, \"internal\"); \n\nWhen the ReplicationHandler tests the value sent in the query string, it uses Boolean.parseBoolean() and expects the string \"true\". I created a packet capture, watching the slave make a request of the master. The transfer of files fails when my solrconfig.xml has a slave configuration like this:\n  <str name=\"compression\">internal</str>\n\nAn exception is thrown on the slave because it is expecting a compressed response from the following:\n  /solr/core/replication?command=filecontent&generation=N ...  &compression=internal&checksum=true&wt=filestream\n\nWhen I manually make the above request, replacing compression=internal with compression=true, the expected compressed response is received from the master.",
