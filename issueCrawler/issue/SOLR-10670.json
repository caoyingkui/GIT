This will be the default name of bookmarks, so I suggest adding Solr version number as part of title. That way you see from the title which guide it is, e.g. So, using exact same title as the title in the top-bar: Solr Ref Guide 7.0? Alternatively Apache Solr 7.0 Reference Guide\n\nedit: Ah, I see why now in the source \n\n<title>{{ page.title }} | {{ site.site_title }}</title>\n\nSo the problem is that page.title for index.adoc is \"Apache Solr Reference Guide\"...\nPerhaps we could modify BuildNavAndPDFBody.java to override \"title\" variable for this page? And also modify the variable site_title to include version, so we instead display something like Home |\u00a0Solr Reference Guide 7.0 ",

            "content": "+1 to adding the favicon, I was going to get to that before release.\n\nThe other link changes are fine with me if folks think they are preferable. Go for it, as we say \n\nAs for the title...The html file is built after BuildNavandPDFBody.java is run. That script develops the data files to populate the sidenav and also the file that is used to make a single page for PDF generation. I think it would be too much \"magic\" to have a script that overwrites the title of any page. Say someday in the future we decide to change the page, who's going to remember exactly why we have a file named index.adoc that declares it's title as \"Apache Solr Reference Guide\" but appears online as \"Home\"? I'd like to minimize the # of leaps people need to make in order to figure out what's going on, where possible. And some of us don't know Java so can't just hop into Java files to figure out why certain things are happening.\n\nIf what you prefer is that it appear something like Home | Apache Solr Reference Guide 7.0, then I think it would be best just to make the page title in index.adoc \"Home\". However, that means the PDF would have a page named \"Home\" for the first page, which doesn't feel right to me. \n\nUnless we can come up with a page name that is short, descriptive for bookmarks, and works in both formats, there is a possible other option, that I have not tried yet, which is to add an ifdef statement that changes the title for the PDF. That would evaluate if the page is being generated for the PDF version, and if so, apply a different title. That would go in index.adoc so anyone looking at it will see why we are doing that (we can add a comment to explain). I will give this a try now to see if that solves it for us. ",

            "content": "I figured out a way to make it all work the way we want...\n\nFirst, index.adoc is going to have to be a \"special\" page, with some special rules. Hopefully comments in the right places will make it clear to all of us in the future what's going on.\n\nI set two new attributes to index.adoc at the top:\n\n\tI removed the = Apache Solr Reference Guide at the top and replaced it with :doctitle: Home. This sets the document title to Home but it will get treated different by the asciidoc preprocessor (see this issue for how I got the idea: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/95). This is totally valid syntax, so doesn't cause either Jekyll or asciidoc-pdf to complain.\n\tI added a new attribute :page-displayname: Apache Solr Reference Guide\n\n\n\nNext I added a conditional statement to index.adoc as follows:\n\n\nifdef::backend-pdf[:notitle:]\nifdef::backend-pdf[]\n= {page-displaytitle}\nendif::[]\n\n\n\nThat says, if it's a PDF, don't set the document title (that :doctitle: attribute). Instead, use the page-displaytitle attribute (\"Apache Solr Reference Guide\"). In the PDF that's generated, the user doesn't see \"Home\" - only \"Apache Solr Reference Guide\" in TOC and page title. We could call this something else if desired. \n\nFor the HTML page, if we set the page title to \"Home\" with something like = Home, then the first thing the user would see at the top of the page is \"Home\", which is bad. So I added a conditional to page.html where that title is set to use the page-displaytitle instead:\n\n\n<div class=\"post-header\">\n   {% if page.title == \"Home\" %}\n   <h1 class=\"post-title-main\">{{ page.displaytitle }}</h1>\n   {% else %}\n   <h1 class=\"post-title-main\">{{ page.title }}</h1>\n   {% endif %}\n</div>\n\n\n\nNow what happens is that the HTML page is generated with metadata that defines Home | Apache Solr Reference Guide as the title, but displays \"Apache Solr Reference Guide\" on the page.\n\nThis all seems to work fine - nothing complains during build. I'll attach a patch so you can see it for yourself. ",

            "content": "That was a smart move \n\nI improved on it somewhat more by adding a conditional <head><title> too in head.html, which simplifies the header title of the home page even more:\n\n{% if page.title == \"Home\" %}\n<title>{{ site.site_title }}</title>\n{% else %}\n<title>{{ page.title }} | {{ site.site_title }}</title>\n{% endif %}\n\n\n\nI built a guide with all these changes which can be previewed at http://cominvent.com/solr-refguide/. New patch attached.\n\nBut now the text above the left-hand menu is \"Home\", which I guess is fine if it was clickable, but it is not. So then perhaps it should say something else? ",

Personally I'd prefer to just make it a bit of white space - a sidebar doesn't need a title, and the action of getting home is  already accomplished by the \"Solr Ref Guide\" link in the top navigation. We really don't need another clickable avenue right below it, IMO.\n\nedit: I meant I don't think it works well - missed the \"don't\" ",
