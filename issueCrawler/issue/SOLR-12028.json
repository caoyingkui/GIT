    "description": "There's a long discussion of this topic at SOLR-12016. Here's a summary:\n\n\n\tBadApple annotations are used for tests that intermittently fail, say < 30% of the time. Tests that fail more often shold be moved to AwaitsFix. This is, of course, a judgement call\n\n\n\n\n\tAwaitsFix annotations are used for tests that, for some reason, the problem can't be fixed immediately. Likely reasons are third-party dependencies, extreme difficulty tracking down, dependency on another JIRA etc.\n\n\n\nJenkins jobs will typically run with BadApple disabled to cut down on noise. Periodically Jenkins jobs will be run with BadApples enabled so BadApple tests won't be lost and reports can be generated. Tests that run with BadApples disabled that fail require immediate attention.\n\nThe default for developers is that BadApple is enabled.\n\nIf you are working on one of these tests and cannot get the test to fail locally, it is perfectly acceptable to comment the annotation out. You should let the dev list know that this is deliberate.\n\nThis JIRA is a placeholder for BadApple tests to point to between the times they're identified as BadApple and they're either fixed or changed to AwaitsFix or assigned their own JIRA.\n\nI've assigned this to myself to track so I don't lose track of it. No one person will fix all of these issues, this will be an ongoing technical debt cleanup effort.",

Some of the failing tests are in areas getting a lot of active work so may be good candidates for leaving in, just let me know.\n\nAssuming that tests pass, I'm probably going to check these in Monday sometime after making another pass to see whether I put them in the right category.\n\nI intend to post the below info to the dev list each Sunday (or so) so these tests don't get lost

Personally I'm going to filter them to a special folder that I can examine at leisure.\n\nAnything run with tests.badapples=false that fails requires immediate attention.

I thought that pointing people at the uber-JIRA would provide more context. Whether that's the right call or not is an open question.\n\nSOLR-7736: Right, I linked it under \"related to\" rather than \"duplicates\", we can add a duplicates link in if you'd like. I put in both JIRAs to allow a complete record, if it's too confusing we can remove, say, the 7736 reference.\n\nAs for AwaitsFix, the theory (which I may not have adhered to completely, feel free to correct) is that when something is actually known to be broken, i.e. code we can point to and say \"this code is broken\" doesn't need to be run until, well, the code is fixed. This would include dependent libs, code where the root cause is known but not fixed and the like. AwaitsFix aren't run periodically so disappear from sight.\n\nBadApple, OTOH, is \"this test doesn't run reliably, we have no clue why\". These are also run periodically for the various reports to be able to see. That way they don't get lost.\n\nIt looked to me like AwaitsFix and BadApple were applied somewhat interchangeably so this is an attempt to bring regularity to the annotations.\n\nI reconstructed SOLR-12016 under SOLR-12037 BTW.\n\nbq: so now this test is running for all developers\n\nAs it should IMO unless and until we do one of the following\n1> decide it's just a crappy test and remove it\n2> identify the root problem is and move it to AwaitsFix and link it to a JIRA with the RCA.\n3> fix it and remove the annotation altogether.\n\nNote that for <3>, I'm starting by commenting out the annotation and providing the date it was commented out on the theory that if the test starts failing again it would be good information to have. OTOH if we look at this in 6 months and it hasn't failed in that time, the commented-out annotation can be removed.\n\nMy two main goals are:\n1> surface any tests that fail regularly with no RCA for reports etc.\n2> get clean runs with BadApple=false to catch regressions\n\nI don't particularly care what the mechanics are. You'll see, every Sunday, a report to the dev list for the current BadApple and AwaitsFix annotations, file and method. This should complement your reports (which are way cool BTW).\n\nSo that's all the theory, I expect a few things to shift around before it all settles out... ",
