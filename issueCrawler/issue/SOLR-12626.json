    "description": "waitForInSyncWithLeader currently returns \"false\" making asserts fail when an exception is thrown while checking if the core is in sync with the leader. This can cause things like the leader being down (i.e. in ChaosMonkey tests) to fail asserts in followers. Instead, we should continue iterating the remaining amount of times.",
