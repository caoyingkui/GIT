However, given that the current code base is very alpha, I don't think a few browser bugs with solrjs should hold up the release of solr 1.4.\n\nRegards,\nAlex Dergachev\nCo-founder, Evolving Web\nhttp://evolvingweb.ca\n\n "

At this point, a patch to fix all its bugs, improve its API, and add all the useful features we've added (e.g. support for bookmarking and the back button), would probably remove every line of SolrJS code and replace it with our code. You can access our code at the following URL. The README provides a concise description of the improvements we've made to SolrJS. I encourage everyone interested in SolrJS to review what we have to offer. It may very well be a practical replacement to SolrJS.\n\nhttp://github.com/evolvingweb/AJAX-Solr "
