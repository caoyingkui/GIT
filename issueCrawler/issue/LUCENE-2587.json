    "description": "I have written  a new Fragmenter since we need fragments for hitlines to be on sentence boundaries and not cross paragraphs. \nWhen using it with org.apache.lucene.search.highlight.Highlighter, I get hitlines that starts with \". \", \"? \", \"! \"...\n\nConsider the text  \"A b c d e. F g h i j! K l m n o. \" \nwhich become the tokenstream : (A) (b) (c) (d) (e) (F) (g) (h)  (j) (K) (l) (m)  (o)  \n\nIf the fragmenter return isNewFragment()  = true on F and K and Highlighter pick the middle fragment, lets say we search on \"g\" the hitline becomes:\n\". F <B>g</B> h i j\"\n\nThe reason, it seems, is that the offset to the fragment boundaries found by taking the endOffset of the last token in a fragment , \nnot the startOffset of the first. \n\nTJ",

I search for \"g\" hence the Highlighter will pick the middle fragment. The fragment it returns is \". F <b>g</b> h i j\". I was wondering if the correct fragment should be \" F <b>g</b> h i j\" or even \"F <b>g</b> h i j\" without the starting whitespace. The starting \".\" is a bug and matches the issue LUCENE-2587. I was wondering if, instead, the starting whitespace at the beginning of the fragment is correct or not. And, in the end, if I understood correctly the issue LUCENE-2587, but I think so. Thanks in advance to anyone who wants to answer. RM ",

I think the ideal way to proceed is create a test fragmenter based on but simpler than your fragmenter, to trigger the bug, and then fix the bug.  Roberto may have already essentially done all of this - I haven't had a chance to look at his patch yet.\n\nOnce that's all done, I think it's appropriate to create a new issue for your sentence fragmenter, since that would be a great addition to Lucene!\n\nThanks again,\nSteve ",

Your fix changes fragments' beginning offsets to exclude preceding inter-fragment non-tokenized characters, but this causes adjacent fragments to be non-contiguous (contiguity is defined as frag1.end==frag2.start).  As a result, your fix prevents adjacent fragments from being merged.  (See mergeContiguousFragments(), which is called from getBestTextFragments().)\n\nIdeally, another test should be added that checks for the problem your current fix causes (adjacency != contiguity), and then your fix should be changed to enable contiguous fragment merging.
