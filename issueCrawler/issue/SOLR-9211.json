This makes the issue more with the lucene/dismmax parsers not accepting negatives, but this is a known limitation. Your query returns no documents both for the q and fq fields. I also found the commonly used workaround for lucene/dismax is to do (foo OR (: -foo)) which returns all docs which is what I want. \nI'll close this issue it appears to be working as expected, given the known limitations.
