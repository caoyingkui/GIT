    "description": "In SOLR-860, I wrote a test for debug info that is produced by MLT component. But I put it in MLT handler test case. As it confuses them, it should be moved to MLT component test case. Also, adding a test for debug info (for handler) in handler test case is nice to have. It avoids introducing regression like that was reported in SOLR-2734.",
