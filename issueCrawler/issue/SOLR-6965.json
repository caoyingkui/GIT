    "description": "In digging in on data-driven/field guessing/schemaless a bit more, my gut instinct after staring at lots of different file types is that we should, if possible, pass MIME type info through to the guessing mechanism so that we can potentially make different choices for different types.  For instance, CSV is much more structured and can likely be smarter about data than XML or PDF.  Same goes for JSON.",

Obviously, with all of this stuff, there are exceptions.  Just trying to hit the sweet spot of right most of the time for most situations, esp. the OOTB experience. ",
