            "content": "The testNodeMarkersRegistration failures are also due to a race condition in the test. The test asserts that a znode is created on node added and node lost events respectively which is then deleted after the trigger fires. But the znode is deleted by the trigger thread whereas the actions are executed by the action executor asynchronously. So sometimes the marker znodes can be deleted even before the test has a chance to assert that they exist. I think we can fix it by using a listener which is executed in the same thread as the trigger and perform the assert there. ",

The test fails only on very fast machines (Steve's jenkins mostly, although I saw 1 failure on policeman jenkins). ",
