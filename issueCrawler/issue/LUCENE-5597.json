    "description": "At the moment, it is not possible to have a \"tree topology\" for replication. The reason is that in order to publish a IndexRevision on a non-root, non-leaf node, one would need to open an IndexWriter on the index. However, the replication directly modifies the index directory without using an IndexWriter, so the indexwriter would not see the changes the replication made.\n\nIndexRevision uses the IndexWriter for deleting unused files when the\nrevision is released, as well as to obtain the SnapshotDeletionPolicy.\n\nIn order to implement this,  two things are needed:\n\n\n\tRevision, which doesn't use IndexWriter.\n\tReplicator which keeps track of how many refs a file has (basically what\nIndexFileDeleter does)",
