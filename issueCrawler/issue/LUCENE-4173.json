I am guessing that Ryan added this concept so that it would be easier to demonstrate easily index a variety of shapes in a variety of different ways, ignoring cases where some strategy doesn't handle some particular shape.  But I think this \"feature\" if you could call it that, has dubious value otherwise.  Clearly it does and should default to false so it won't harm anyone if they leave this alone.   ",

I can't see a situation where an API consumer would then cycle through alternative Strategys.  Is the idea to push the decision about whether to ignore or to throw an Exception, to the consumer? I kind of like that.  Except we're still going to have to either ignore or throw an Exception in createIndexFields() if the Strategy is given a bad Shape and I still believe ignoring is the bad choice.\n\tWhy limit this to indexing? Surely the same applies to filtering too.  I don't really like the idea of a CONTAINS op when given a Point so I'm presented with the same issue, either ignore the Shape or throw an Exception.\n\tWhy allow Strategys to ignore Shapes at all? The Shape interface provides two fallback options when indexing or filtering.  You can either use the Shape's bounding box or its centre point.  No they might not be ideal, but if a Strategy can only support Rectangles or Points, then it can still index a Shape.  We can then document that Strategys must index or filter any Shape, but can degrade if necessary.\n\n ",

So if you wanted to demo shapes being indexed in different ways with different strategies, you could implement ignoreIncompatibleGeometry at the consumer level (e.g. Solr adapter) and not have to catch an exception to find out, which would make me cringe.\n\nWhy limit this to indexing?\nRight, of course \u2013 it should apply to a query shape too.  And thinking along these lines, perhaps this is also a way to advertise what SpatialOperation's are supported?:\n\nSpatialOperation[] getSupportedSpatialOperations()\n\n\n\nJust an idea.\n\nHaving said all this, and even suggested these methods for consideration, I don't think these informational meta methods are particularly useful because about the only real use-case I can think of is the strategy demo, which is so-so of a use-case, IMO, and consumer-level alternatives could be added.  I think Javadoc on the Strategy is fine and should be required anyway \u2013 I shouldn't have to write code or find the source to determine what operations are supported.  To that end, I will add some documentation to these Strategies soon.\n\nWhy allow Strategys to ignore Shapes at all?\nI don't like it either.

In addition the the class level javadoc, perhaps we can expand the package.html with some tables of Strategys vs. supported shapes and vs. supported operations.  As long as we keep that up to date, it'll be a nice reference.\n\nThis still poses the question of what to do in a Strategy when given a Shape that is unsupported.

I think we need to encourage in documentation that Strategys are much like analysis components, you need to consider which you choose carefully, you need to understand what they do and you will need to experiment.

If a strategy can only index points it will get the center point of the given shape.  If the strategy can only index bounding boxes then it will index the bounding box of the given shape.  Query time is similar.  This could go for both index & query.  Some of the strategies are doing this already.  Assuming we like the coalesceIncompatibleGeometry concept, is it true by default?  I lean towards yes but I could go either way.  And maybe SpatialArgs has the boolean independently so the client can indicate a different policy for query time? ",
