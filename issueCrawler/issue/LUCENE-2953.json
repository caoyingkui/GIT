            "content": "There seems to be no consensus on how to deal with generic arrays. Even the JDK has two different implementations \u2013 one in ArrayDeque (uses T[]), the other in ArrayList (uses Object[]). Creating an array of a given component type is (can be?) more costly than keeping an array Object[] because it needs to be done via call to Array.newArray (haven't checked though). Theoretically having a concrete-type array should speed up iterators (because no additional casts are needed), but I don't think this is the case. \n\nIn fact, I just wrote a simple Caliper benchmark that compares these (attached), my results show the runtime times is nearly identical (probably within stddev).:\n\n\n 0% Scenario{vm=java, trial=0, benchmark=Generic, size=1000000} 8985430.93 ns; \u03c3=257329.28 ns @ 10 trials\n33% Scenario{vm=java, trial=0, benchmark=GenericSubclass, size=1000000} 8989486.27 ns; \u03c3=207151.20 ns @ 10 trials\n67% Scenario{vm=java, trial=0, benchmark=Object, size=1000000} 8767324.34 ns; \u03c3=218235.97 ns @ 10 trials\n\n      benchmark   ms linear runtime\n        Generic 8.99 =============================\nGenericSubclass 8.99 ==============================\n         Object 8.77 =============================\n\nvm: java\ntrial: 0\nsize: 1000000\n\n ",

            "content": "The easy and most simply way to handle this is osing Object[] like in ArrayList.\n\nThe problem with then always casting from Object to T is thousands of unchecked warnings in PriorityQueue. I would propose the following:\nIn general the final T[] heap variable should be private to the PQ and used only there. For performance yonik wanted the heap[] protected and that caused the issue. As long as the heap[] array is private it can never be accessed incorrectly.\n\nSo my proposal is to internally use the T[] as a private field and simply use another Object[] thats protected (pointing to the same array). This would fix the problem. The most correct idea would be to add a setHeapSlot(int, T o) and T getHeapSlot(int) method and hiding the T[] heap completely, but I know, Yonik will disagree \n\nThere is some other problem: the heap array should be final, but it cannot, because of the stupid initialize() method. I would like to remove this method and simply move the code to PQ's ctor. I don't understand why the initialize() method is there, which is a problem: Every guide on Java programming tells you to never call protected overrideable methods from ctors, as this can break easily. If the heap[] is final, the problem of having two references to the same object is not a problem anymore. ",

To enable this special case, a boolean field was used. But the ctor had to populate that field before the prepoulating in super() was done, and thats impossible.
