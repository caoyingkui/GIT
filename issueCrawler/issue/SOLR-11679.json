    "description": "I whiped up a little TraceValueSource and trave() function parser to help demonstrate how/when the ValueSource API was used by the FunctionRangeQParser for the purposes of a blog post i'm about to publish.\n\nEssentially it just writes a log message with some tracing details everytime one of the FunctionValue methods (ie: exists, intVal, floatVal, etc...) are called, so that when used from FunctionRangeQParser you can see how things like cost and post-filtering impact things.\n\nI don't think there is a lot of value in committing the code as is \u2013 it would be dangerously verbose on non trivial indexes \u2013 but i wanted to put the patch in jira in case it inspires anyone with a more interesting idea.",
