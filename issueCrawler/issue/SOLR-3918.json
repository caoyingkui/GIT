Currently slf4j-api is left in.\n\nThe wiki needs to be updated with instructions on how to use the -excl-slf4j war to run jetty with an alternate binding, such as log4j.  As I have just figured out how to do this, I can handle the first draft of the wiki additions. "

            "content": "I've changed the issue title, because the latest version of the patch changes how dist-war-excl-slf4j works, in addition to creating a new dist-excl-slf4j target.  The current build.xml leaves slf4j-api in the war, forcing you to stick with that specific slf4j version.  The patch removes all slf4j jars from the war.\n\nWith my patch, someone who wants to change the slf4j binding can go to slf4j.org and download the newest version.  By putting the appropriate jars into the proper location (lib/ext for the included jetty8), they can use the -excl-slf4j war and have everything work.  The required jars are slf4j-api, jcl-over-slf4j, log4j-over-slf4j, the required binding jar.  In the case of log4j, you have to include the log4j jar itself as well. "

            "content": "Discussion on SOLR-4129 touched on this issue.  I think my patch for this issue needs to be committed.  My patch does two things:  1) adds a new target so you can exclude slf4j but still get everything else that \"dist\" gives you now.  2) Removes the sl4j api jar from the war in addition to the other slf4j jars.  Restating my reasoning for number 2:\n\nWhen you choose to exclude slf4j and use your own binding, you're already going to have to go track down jars from an external source and add them to your install.  The path of least resistance will lead you to download a newer version of slf4j (1.7.2 right now) than is found in Solr (1.6.4 right now).  Because of the api jar sitting in the war, this won't work.  If a bug or performance problem is found that affects Solr, it's a fair amount of manual work to get operational with a new slf4j version.  My patch eliminates that problem, with the additional requirement that you include the api jar yourself. "
