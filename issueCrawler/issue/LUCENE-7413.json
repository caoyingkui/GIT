We want at some point move master to java 9 and make real modules or of it.\n\tjavadocs in Java 8 already have the duplicate packages problem!

In addition, the following modules need the same treatment: solr-core (both the compile and the test modules) and solr/contrib/analytics.  I'll commit a fix shortly.\u0010 "
