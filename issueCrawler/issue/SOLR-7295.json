    "description": "LUCENE-6369 changed Query.clone to clone deeply.\nThis is going to represent a performance regression to some who have very large / complex queries.\n\n\n\ttry to remove any uses of clone() (we assumed shallow clone, and that's no longer the case)\n\tattempt to minimize the use of queries that do rewrite (we can only do this in our own query implementations).   A query that rewrites to a different query will now cause everything to be deep cloned if it's used in a boolean query anywhere.",
