            "content": "Thanks Domenico, the patch looks good to me. The only change I'd do is to move this line: \n\nfinal Collection<Replica> allSliceReplicas = slice.getReplicasMap().values();\n\n inside of the new method, and make it receive the Slice as parameter instead (which in addition it makes it more obvious that it will collect the replicas for a particular slice). What do you think?\nI don't think we need to commit this to 6.x, 6.6 is about to be released and I don't believe there will be a 6.7, 7.0 is close. I'm running tests now and will commit shortly. ",
