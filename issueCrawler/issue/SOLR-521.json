In both cases doing \"the right thing\" had some subtle impacts on the matching/scoring of docs that made me realize changing the default is probably not in the best interests of existing users (if it caused problems like this in our simple unit tests, it could have some pretty serious impacts on real world cases)\n\nFWIW, here's the verbage i was going to add...\n\n\n\nA new \"enablePositionIncrements\" option has been added to the\nStopFilterFactory.  The default value is \"true\", indicating that a\n\"gap\" should be left when a stop word is removed, which will affect\nhow much slop is required in order for Phrase Queries to match.  Users\nwho wish to preserve previous behavior should add\n'enablePositionIncrements=\"false\"' to usages of StopFilterFactory in\ntheir schema.xml.  Other users should consider reindexing to ensure\nconsistency in behavior for all documents.  "
