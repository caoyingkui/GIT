I've tinkered with things a bit (diff my patch and your patch to see specifically) including: changed globe icon to gear simply because it was already built-in and doesn't refer to a remote resource, some minor resource properties tweaks, and additionally I added, tangentially, the extracting of e-mail addresses and URLs from file content into email_ss and url_ss fields (try &facet.field=email_ss&facet.field=url_ss).\n\nMaybe we add back a globe icon, but something small, free for us to use legally, and built-in.  Note: binary files need to be added to JIRA tickets separately from .patch files. ",
