I think that would be an easy improvement to\nthose enum classes..., for consistency maybe do the same with DocsEnum, or even\nthink of a new name for that one entirely, I'm not sure. ",

I can't suggest good java names at this time,\nbut these are the english names:\n\n\n\tTerms.getDocCount() -> \"number of documents with value\"\n\tTerms.getSumDocFreq() -> \"number of postings\"\n\tTerms.getSumTotalTermFreq() -> \"number of tokens\"\n\n\n\nTermsEnum.totalTermFreq is probably ok, but maybe it was named that way\nonly to be consistent with docFreq?
