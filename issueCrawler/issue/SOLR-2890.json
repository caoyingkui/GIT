    "description": "Setting omitTermFreqAndPositions=\"true\" doesn't work when I put it on a fieldType definition for my text field.  It did work when I put it on the field definition.  I think this option and probably all options should be settable at the fieldType level.  I did some investigation and found that the value of this option was being reset on line 54 of TextField.\n\nFYI I am trying to put this on a field type for use by the SpellCheck component which has no use for term frequencies and positions from the source field.",

            "content": "I believe this is a Bug, not an Improvement, and that it is not Minor.\n\nThe docs at http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml explicitly state that \"Common options that field types can have are...\" and lists omitTermFreqAndPositions.\n\nIn my case, I created a custom type for ISBNs specified like so:\n\n        <fieldType name=\"isbn\" class=\"solr.TextField\" stored=\"true\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" omitNorms=\"true\" omitTermFreqAndPositions=\"true\">\n            <analyzer>\n                <!-- Remove anything not a digit or X -->\n                <charFilter class=\"solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory\"\n                    pattern=\"[^0-9Xx]\"\n                    replacement=\"\"\n                    replace=\"all\"\n                    />\n                <tokenizer class=\"solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory\" />\n                <filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n            </analyzer>\n        </fieldType>\n\n\nwith the field definition like so:\n\n        <field name=\"isbn\" type=\"isbn\" omitTermFreqAndPositions=\"true\" multiValued=\"true\" />\n\nIt was surprising, then, to find that my core's index directory had 600MB of *.prx files, when there should not be any position information anywhere in the core.\n\nWhen I then updated the field definition to:\n\n        <field name=\"isbn\" type=\"isbn\" omitTermFreqAndPositions=\"true\" multiValued=\"true\" />\n\nand reindexed the core, the *.prx files were no longer created.\n\nBased on David Smiley's reading of the code at in TextField.java, the culprit seems to be:\n\n    if (schema.getVersion()> 1.1f) properties &= ~OMIT_TF_POSITIONS;\n\nwhich is at least reassuring that omitNorms and omitPositions seem to be unchanged.\n\nThe fix to this could be as simple as changing the wiki to state that omitTermFreqAndPositions must be specified at the field level.

            "content": "--then change the wiki \n\nBut this is still a problem, sure.  It's \"minor\" because the work-around is trivial.\n\nMinor aside:  You should use a regex at the TokenFilter level, not the CharFilter.  It's a bit slower at the CharFilter and there might be problems with highlighting if you use the regex to change the field length.  CharFilters are designed to work in advance of the Tokenizer when you need to modify what the Tokenizer sees.  There will never be such a problem with KeywordTokenizer. "

            "content": "This seems like a really bad bug for two reasons:\n\n1) even if there is a trivial work around, it's the kind of thing that most users aren't going to be savvy enough to even realize isn't working properly (ie: it has no obvious \"ERROR\") ... you really have to go out of your way to discover that the extra data is in your index even though you asked for it not to be.\n\n2) it appears to have been broken for years and yet none of the tests anyone has written in that time have managed to tickle it to make any one notice.\n\nSo i spent a bit of time trying to write an exhaustive test of the way all the diff version specific default props work, to prove that the defaults did what they should, and that overriding them did what it should \u2013 which lead me to discover there is a similar problem with omitNorms on fieldTYpes.\n\nI'm updating the summary to note this for future searchers, and i'll attach my patch with test and fixes for review\n "
