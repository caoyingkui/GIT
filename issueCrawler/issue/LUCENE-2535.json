    "description": "some field storage strategies can be much improved by immediate break vs. the break-and-load currently provided.\nthis adds another break option, which makes it more advantageous to have member variables of the enum that indicate it's a break/load etc. vs. doing a bunch of grouped == checks.\n\nThe BREAK option should cause an early termination with include == false in the ParallelReader when the BREAK before any other field, then the document should not be loaded from that reader. This is fairly easy to validate with a test, which is included in the patch.",
