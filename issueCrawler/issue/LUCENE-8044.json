    "description": "I noticed that the uax_url_email tokenizer splits urls in multiple tokens in presence of digits, \".\", \"-\"\n\nI opened a issue on elasticsearch github repo (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27309) because I noticed this strange behaviour.\n\nTheir answer was \n\nThe uax_url_email tokenizer tokenizes URLs and email addresses, but in order to recognize a token as a URL it must include the scheme (usually HTTP:// or https://):\nAdditionally, this tokenizer belongs to Lucene. Could you open this issue at https://lucene.apache.org/core/ instead?\n\nURLs are defined by RFC1738 and extended by RFC1808. \nIn RFC1808 Relative URLs are explained, and this allows scheme-less URLs.\nI would expect uax_url_email to tokenize correctly also scheme-less and relative URL.",
