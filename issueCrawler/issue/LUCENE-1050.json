I plan to throw a new LockReleaseFailedException, subclassing from IOException, when this returns false.  This is a very minor change to backwards compatibility because all methods in Lucene that release a lock already throw IOException.",

Even then, it might make sense to catch and ignore LockReleaseFailedException and let whatever resulting exception may originate from \"new IndexWriter\" be returned. ",
