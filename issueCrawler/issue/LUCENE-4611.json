    "description": "At first we had lots of stuff in lib/ including .sha1 files and so on. So we didnt want to have this in the classpath because its just noisy.\n\nBut nowadays we use an ivy sync=true, the only things in lib are the jars in the ivy.xml.\n\nSo we can just put lib/ dirs in the classpath and not have redundant jar names also in build.xml: this makes it harder to upgrade and maintain.",
