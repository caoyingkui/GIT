    "description": "Mike reported this on the mailing list. This is fully reproducible, you just need to run it twice:\n\ncd lucene\n# succeeds\nant prepare-release-no-sign\n# fails\nant prepare-release-no-sign\n\n\n\nThe problem is with this target that runs conditionally:\n\n  <target name=\"-unpack-lucene-tgz\" unless=\"lucene.tgz.unpack.dir.exists\">\n    <antcall target=\"-ensure-lucene-tgz-exists\" inheritall=\"false\">\n      <propertyset refid=\"uptodate.and.compiled.properties\"/>\n    </antcall>\n    <mkdir dir=\"${lucene.tgz.unpack.dir}\"/>\n    <untar compression=\"gzip\" src=\"${lucene.tgz.file}\" dest=\"${lucene.tgz.unpack.dir}\">\n      <patternset refid=\"patternset.lucene.solr.jars\"/>\n    </untar>\n  </target>\n\n\n\nI attach a diff from the two runs \u2013 you can see the second one skipped this task and then cleaned the output folder, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI don't know how to fix, but I think it's this.",
