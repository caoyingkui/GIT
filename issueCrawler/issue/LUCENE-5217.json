    "description": "Our ivy configuration does this: each dependency is specified and so we know what will happen. Unfortunately the maven setup is not configured the same way.\n\nInstead the maven setup is configured to download the internet: and it excludes certain things specifically.\n\nThis is really hard to configure and maintain: we added a 'validate-maven-dependencies' that tries to fail on any extra jars, but all it really does is run a license check after maven \"runs\". It wouldnt find unnecessary dependencies being dragged in if something else in lucene was using them and thus they had a license file.\n\nSince maven supports wildcard exclusions: MNG-3832, we can disable this transitive shit completely.\n\nWe should do this, so its configuration is the exact parallel of ivy.",

tested a single Solr module and looked at a single dependency's transitive dependency: solrj module, zookeeper dependency, and zookeeper's transitive dependency netty.\n\nHere's the zookeeper

I think it's most of the way there though.\n\nThe strategy is to put all modules' classpath-s and test.classpath-s into a single properties file using vanilla Ant, and then feed that into a new custom Ant task that also reads all the ivy.xml files, the centralized ivy versions file, and the external dependencies' ivy.xml files in the Ivy cache, then output a filters file that is used when copy'ing the POM templates to maven-build/, so that the appropriate spots are filled in with the right stuff.\n\nIt's kludgy, in that properties files are used to communicate some information, rather than directly, but I can't see a way to do it all in memory.\n\nDon't be scared by the size of the patch: the majority is just removing the hard-coded dependencies in the POM templates.
