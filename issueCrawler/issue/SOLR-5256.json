    "description": "There's been several times when I wish I could specify multiple queries through the highlighter. For example, a search over books may have an option to filter jy author. If I wanted to highlight both the primary search terms and the author match I'd have to construct an hl.q that created the desire highlight query.\n\nThis is complicated by the fact that q might be dismax/edismax while the fq is likely going to be a lucene query. It might be rather complex to construct a single query that reflects the combination of dismax over many fields plus a specific lucene query.\n\nWhat I would prefer to do is be able to specify additional queries (hl.addlq) to the highlighter. The highlighter then highlights the results of those queries as well. \n\n(Unfortunately, while this is useful, its limited somewhat by this bug:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4812#comment-13772151)",
