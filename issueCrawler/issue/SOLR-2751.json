But this wouldn't be needed. For this example upper is ignored. Currently checks are done:\n\n[lower] -> start loop at\n[regexp] -> miss: continue\n[upper] -> miss: break\n[freq] -> miss: continue\n\nshould be done:\n\n[lower] -> start loop at\n[upper] -> miss: break\n[freq] -> miss: continue (I think double compare is much faster then a std regexp)\n[regexp] -> miss: continue",
