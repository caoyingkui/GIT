No crash\n\n\tno exception but no results neither.\n\n\n\nReplacing the 2 last lines by \n\tbigger.add(requete1,false,false);\n\tbigger.add(pq,false,false);\nis working perfectly",

The 'more'\nvariable is set to true even all the subscorers are done.\nForcing this value to false with a debugger makes the method return nicely - the\nnumber of docs is correct as well. I just need to understand how this more\nvariable has been changed to 'true'.\n\nThis problem appears with any of my indices in 1.3 or 1.4 version. I tried to\ncreate a RAMDirectory in a test file and populate it with some data but the\nproblem does not appear in that case.  ",
