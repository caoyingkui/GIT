    "description": "This is like StopFilter, except if the token is the very last token\nand there were no non-token characters after it, it keeps the token.\n\nThis is useful with analyzing suggesters (AnalyzingSuggester,\nAnalyzingInfixSuggester, FuzzySuggester), where you often want to\nremove stop words, but not if it's the last word and the user hasn't\nfinished typing it.\n\nE.g. \"fast a\" might complete to \"fast amoeba\", but if you simply use\nStopFilter then the a is removed.\n\nReally our analysis APIs aren't quite designed to handle a \"partial\"\ntokens that suggesters need to work with.",
