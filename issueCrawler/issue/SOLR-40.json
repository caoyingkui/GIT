Scores are\nset to null here \u2013 but, as you indicate, they are also set to null if\nyou getDocListNC, but that does not end up with an error.  I agree\nthat the underlying issue should also be addressed, as well, but I\nhave not dug deeply enough into the internals to see the cause yet.\n\nHere is the stack trace, when using a getDocListAndSet method without flags:\n\n09> Started org.mortbay.jetty.Server@29ab3e\nJul 25, 2006 9:32:22 PM org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore execute\nINFO:\nrows=10&explainOther=&start=0&indent=on&q=dell&fl=&qt=dismax&stylesheet=&v\nersion=2.1 0 140\nJul 25, 2006 9:32:22 PM org.apache.solr.core.SolrException log\nSEVERE: java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.apache.solr.search.DocSlice$1.score(DocSlice.java:116)\n        at org.apache.solr.request.XMLWriter.writeDocList(XMLWriter.java:346)\n        at org.apache.solr.request.XMLWriter.writeVal(XMLWriter.java:385)\n        at org.apache.solr.request.XMLWriter.writeResponse(XMLWriter.java:106)\n        at\norg.apache.solr.request.XMLResponseWriter.write(XMLResponseWriter.jav\na:29)\n        at org.apache.solr.servlet.SolrServlet.doGet(SolrServlet.java:96)\n        at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:596)\n        at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:689)\n        at\norg.mortbay.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder.handle(ServletHolder.java:428\n)",
