This should probably be the default action, but requiring ?action=STATUS wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\nIt would be very useful if CloudSolrServer were to implement a getCollections method, but that probably should be a separate issue.",

Within CloudSolrServer, it might make sense to use the ZK objects rather than /admin/collections, but I don't think we should force a user to do so. "
