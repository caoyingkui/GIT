There are a couple issues that I will try and address soon:\n\nIf there is only one doc in the index, the proximity search will wrap from end to beginning. The hashcode method needs to include the proximity field in it's calculation (an easy fix). ",

I've used it enough to know that it appears to work right, but I could easily have missed issues when there was nothing to exclude.\n\nFYI: this is based on SpanNot - where SpanNot would have rejected, this lets it go until a count of n. I'll work on some tests when I get a chance.\n ",
