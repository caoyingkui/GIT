    "description": "David Smiley wrote in SOLR-9090:\n\nChristine Poerschke I'm looking at SolrTestCaseJ4.CloudSolrClientBuilder. Instead of the somewhat complicated tracking using configuredDUTflag, couldn't you simply remove all that stuff and just modify the builder's constructor to randomize the settings?\n\nFurthermore, shouldn't shardLeadersOnly be randomized as well?\n\nThis ticket is to follow-up on that suggestion since SOLR-9090 is already closed.",

            "content": "+1 wonderful.\n\nAlso, from my \"Find All Usages\" examinations for the l getCloudSolrClient(...) methods, it appears no test wants to explicitly set shardLeadersOnly to any particular value.  I think those test utility methods could be simplified to not have this parameter.\n\nFWIW I don't like the \"get\" terminology, I would have gone with \"make\" or \"new\" or \"create\", and possibly one that actually returned the builder so the caller has the option of setting setters to then call build() which is simple enough and more explicit. This would be fewer utility methods that are of dubious need if the usages are very few.  Perhaps this stretches the scope of the issue a little; I'd be happy to help if you don't want to Christine Poerschke.  What do you think of this idea Anshum Gupta? You committed this in SOLR-8097.\nWhat I'm thinking:\n\n  public static CloudSolrClientBuilder newCloudSolrClient(String zkHost) {\n    return (CloudSolrClientBuilder) new CloudSolrClientBuilder().withZkHost(zkHost);\n  }\n\n ",

I refactored callers of setParallelUpdates (which all randomly set it in tests) to not do so anymore, relying on this happening implicitly now.  setParallelUpdates is still there but now marked deprecated and doesn't do anything (is this ok?).  I should probably change the issue title accordingly as this change isn't just some little test change.  I wonder why anyone would disable this setting?  Seems unlikely to be useful, so I suspect the impact is low.  Suggested new title: \"move CloudSolrClient.setParallelUpdates to the Builder\". ",

I implemented some of these, but stopped when there didn't seem to be much interest in unifying the SolrClient setters.
