    "description": "If I start replication by issuing a \"fetchindex\" command with a \"masterUrl\" parameter, it seems to me (by looking at the trunk code) that \"abortfetch\" command would not do anything. \nIt appears to be aborting only when replication is configured with hardcoded master/slave cores.\n\nThe fix appears to be to use tempSnapPuller.abortPull always because tempSnapPuller is always the snap puller doing the actual work.",
