Also the ability to un-hard-delete is a bit scary to me because of the documents that got marked as deleted because they failed indexing. Maybe PendingSoftDeletes should manage their bits directly instead of relying on the live docs format? \n\nAlso do we need to detect null values more proactively now that the NumericDocValuesField constructor allows to pass nulls?
