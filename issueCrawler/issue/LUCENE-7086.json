And since this is a\ncompletely new feature, new code will have to be written to use it,\nand that new code can work per segment ... there are many examples\n(the point queries, the tests) showing how.  Finally, this solution\nisn't trappy (after this fix): you get a clear exception saying it's\nnot supported, and you can always wrap your reader to hide its point\nvalues if you want to slow wrap everything else.
