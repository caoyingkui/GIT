It fixes the\ngeneric \"text\" fieldType to have good all around defaults for all\nlanguages, so that non-whitespace languages work fine.\n\nThen, I think we should iteratively add in custom languages over time\n(as separate issues).  We can eg add text_en_autophrase, text_en,\ntext_zh, etc.  We should at least do first sweep of nice analyzers\nmodule and add fieldTypes for them.\n\nThis way we will eventually get to the ideal future when we have\ntext_XX coverage for many languages.

We shouldn't\nlock ourselves into poor defaults.\n\nEspecially, as things improve and we get better analyzers, etc., we\nshould be free to improve the defaults in schema.xml to take advantage\nof these improvements.\n\nBut at this point, it seems like the best way forward is to leave \"text\" as an english fieldType and simply add other fieldTypes that can support other languages.\n\nI think this is a dangerous approach \u2013 the name (ie, missing _en if\nin fact it has such English-specific configuration) is misleading and\ntraps new users.\n\nIdeally, in the future, we wouldn't even have a \"text\" fieldType, only\ntext_XX per-language examples and then maybe something like\ntext_general, which you use if you cannot find your language.\n\n\nSome downsides I see to this patch (i.e. trying to make the 'text' fieldType generic):\n\nThe current WordDelimiterFilter options the fieldType feel like a trap for non-whitespace-delimited languages.

            "content": "Largely agree with @Hoss' suggestion. But I think it would be wise to emphasize that the example schema is just that - an example - encouraging people to create new fieldTypes instead of editing the example ones. It's not a problem for \"int\", \"date\" etc, but for text I always encourage our customers and students to stay away from the FieldTypes in the example and make their own versions instead.\n\nOne way to further encourage this best practice is naming all text FieldTypes clearly as examples, e.g. \n\n\n<fieldType name=\"text_example_en\" ..>\n<fieldType name=\"text_example_generic\" ..>\n\n\n\nWe must realize that a lot of non-american users out there are already customizing their schemas with the naming pattern \"text_<lang>\", which means you'll find \"text_en\", \"text_it\", \"text_no\" in a lot of installations. Therefore it would be un-wise to introduce new FieldTypes wich crashes with those names out of the box in version 3.2, thus include _example in the type name.\n\nWhen upgrading, I always leave all the example field types intact, and add my custom ones separately, clearly marked by comments for easy copy/paste. I believe this to be a fairly common practice, and wanted as well, which would give no clashes for the above example.\n\nWith this example naming practice, we can be pretty sure that if people talk about the fieldType \"text_example_en\" on the lists, they mean the default example type, but if they talk about \"text_en\", it's something they've customized themselves (if so by simply renaming the example). It'll be more mental resitance for people to start modifying something with \"_example\" in it wihout also changing the name. "
