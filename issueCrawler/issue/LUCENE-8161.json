    "description": "Spatial4j 0.7 was released late December 2017, principally with support for JTS 1.15. \u00a0There are some other changes less pertinent to Lucene/Solr but I'll refer to the change list:\u00a0\n\nhttps://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/blob/spatial4j-0.7/CHANGES.md\n\nThis JTS release has an API breakage in that the package root was changed from com.vividsolutions\u00a0to org.locationtech\u00a0but should otherwise be compatible. JTS is now dual-licensed as EPL 1.0 and EDL 1.0 (a BSD style 3-clause license). This JTS release also included various improvements, including faster LineString intersection. \u00a0That performance improvement was found in the context of Lucene spatial-extras real-world use.\n\nAnyone using JTS with lucene-spatial-extras will be forced to update to JTS 1.15. \u00a0I'd like to add a test dependency from\u00a0lucene-spatial-extras to JTS (the BSD licensed version of course) as there is at least one\u00a0test with a JUnit \"assumeTrue\" on it being on the classpath \u2013\u00a0JtsPolygonTest.",
