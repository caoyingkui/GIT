    "description": "TermVectorComponent supports distributed-search since SOLR-3229 added it.  Unlike most other components, this one tries to support schemas without a UniqueKey.  However it's logic for attempting to do this was made faulty with the introduction of distrib.singlePass, and furthermore this part wasn't tested any way.  In this issue I want to remove support for schemas lacking a UniqueKey with this component (only for distributed-search).",

            "content": "The attach patch:\n\n\tFixes the invalid/confusing response when there's a distributed single-pass situation.\n\tRemoved uniqueKeyFieldName as a key in the TV response NamedList.  Okay I didn't have to do this but this seemed totally out of place.  HighlightComponent & DebugComponent don't do this.\n\tAdded test that fails without these changes \u2013 the distrib.singlePass case.\n\n\n\nThe changes also then allows for an eventual refactoring of common code in finishStage (the loop filling arr).  This is the part affected by a distrib.singlePass bug in 3 search components.  I won't do that refactoring here though; I'll do it in BNGS-8059.\n\nAssuming tests pass I'll commit this in a couple days. ",
