    "description": "Right now, the collections API isn't self contained - to do server administration, you still have to externally use the zkCli.sh scripts to upload configs.\n\nIt would be really nice to be able to issue a collections API call to upload a configuration and link that config. I realize that this providing a direct layer into Zk, but the benefit is that at that point - Zk could be completely hidden and behind the scenes - and only exposed to Solr itself.\n\nI would suggest that it take a file upload, examples:\n\n/solr/admin/collections\n   action=UPCONFIG\n   configName=whatevername\n   configSolrHome=whateverpath\n   configContent=fileUpload/multipart\n   configContentType=typeOfUpload(mimetype?)\n\n/solr/admin/collections\n   action=LINKCONFIG\n   collection=collname\n   configName=whatevername\n\n\nYou could even extend the CREATE operation/api to take configContent and configContentType file upload, and dynamically create a configName. Then creating a collection becomes a one-shot API call with no outside dependencies.\n\nI would suggest that the zip/tar content be specified as rooted at the based of the config dir.",
