    "description": "As all collection commands in Solr Cloud that have to do with sharding and replication are ultimately passed through to each Core shard, it is currently impossible to get fine grained control of the core actions.  Case in point, when deleting a collection via a curl command, the collection handler processes the request but only passes through the collection name to the zkController.  So parameters that can be used to unload the core, such as deleteDataDir, deleteIndex, etc cannot be passed.  Likewise on collection create - no core parameters such as schema are ultimately passed to the core handling.",
