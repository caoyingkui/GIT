    "description": "SOLR-3056 discusses introducing a default field type text_ja for Japanese in schema.xml.  This configuration will be improved by also introducing default stopwords and stoptags configuration for the field type.  \n\nI believe this configuration should be easily available and tunable to Solr users and I'm proposing that we introduce the same stopwords and stoptags provided in LUCENE-3745 to Solr example configuration.  I'm proposing that files can live in solr/example/solr/conf as stopwords_ja.txt and stoptags_ja.txt alongside stopwords_en.txt for English.  (Longer term, I think should reconsider our overall approach to this across all languages, but that's perhaps a separate discussion.)",

So for now I don't think its a huge\nrisk that we don't have an auto-sync process... but we need to tackle these problems to easily integrate european languages anyway.\n\nSo I dont think this should block this issue, lets get japanese up and going for now.

Happy to follow up on the latter if this is what you'd like to see in the patch. "
