    "description": "SOLR-8925 is shaping up nicely. It would be great if Solr could support outputting graphs in GraphML. This will allow users to visualize their graphs in a number of graph visualization tools (NodeXL, Gephi, Tulip etc...). This ticket will create a new Graph handler which will take a Streaming Expression graph traversal and output GraphML. A new GraphMLResponseWriter will handle the GraphML formatting. In future releases we can consider supporting other graph formats.",

            "content": "Initial implementations of the GraphHandler and GraphMLResponsWriter attached. The GraphHandler simply takes a Streaming Expression compiles it and initializes a Traversal object and adds it to the StreamContext. The TupleStream and Traversal objects are added to the request context. The GraphMLResponseWriter gets the TupleStream and Traversal from the request context, opens the stream and iterates the Tuples outputting the GraphML formatting for the nodes and edges. All the traversal logic is encapsulated inside of the TupleStream.\n\nProper patches and test cases to follow. ",
