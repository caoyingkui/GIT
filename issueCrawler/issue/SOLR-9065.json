So code compiled against 6.0.1 that does \"new SolrInputDocument()\" raises NoSuchMethodError when run with version 6.1.0. It's still source compatible so a recompilation of the same source against a newer version will generate the correct constructor call.\n\nI'm not sure if that's important to you, but adding back the no-arg constructor would help when using different dependencies that are compiled against different solrj versions.\n\nCheers,\nJon ",
