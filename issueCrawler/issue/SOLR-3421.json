    "description": "The distributed search feature allows one to configure the list of shards the SearchHandler should query and aggregate results from using the \"shards\" parameter. Unfortunately, there is no way to configure any sort of authentication between shards and a distributed search-enabled SearchHandler. It'd be good to be able to specify an authentication type, auth credentials, and transport security to allow installations that don't have the benefit of being protected by a firewall some measure of security.",

The base mechanism provided in this patch can be used in both cases.\n\nHTH!\nPeter "
