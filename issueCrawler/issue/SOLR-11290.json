And even replacing the \" \" with a very specific subject that is returned fails.  However \n\nselect(\n  search(enron, fl=\"Mail_From_s, Mail_To_s, Content_Length_i, subject_s\", q=\":\", sort=\"Mail_From_s asc\"),\n  Mail_From_s as from,\n  Mail_To_s as to,\n  Content_Length_i as length,\n  subject_s as subject,\n  replace(length,1118,withValue=0)\n)\n\nDoes actually work (on the numeric field)\n\nThis leads to the conclusion (though not documented) that replace doesn't support text/string fields or values. IT should...or at least the documentation should mention it doesn't.",
