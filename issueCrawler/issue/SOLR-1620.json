    "description": "Solr logs a message like this:\n\nINFO: created null: org.apache.solr.analysis.LowerCaseFilterFactory\n\n\n\nThis sounds like the TokenFilter or Tokenizer were not created and a serious error.  But it mealy means the component is not named.  \"null\" is printed because the local variable \"name\" has the value null.\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nIf the text field type is not named, it should just print blank, rather than the word \"null\".\n\nI would suggest that a line in src/java/org/apache/solr/util/plugin/AbstractPluginLoader.java be changed to:\n\n          log.info(\"created\"+((name!=null)?(\" \"+name):\"\")+\": \" + plugin.getClass().getName() );\n\n\nfrom\n\n          log.info(\"created \"+name+\": \" + plugin.getClass().getName() );",
