    "description": "I admit it's selfish. I have a git workflow and I often do \"git clean -xfd\" which restores a pristine state of the current branch (faster than ant clean . Unfortunately this also results in removal of Eclipse files. \"ant eclipse\" doesn't reset formatting properly so I need to restore it manually.\n\nThis patch does two things:\n\n\tit sets project formatting automatically on \"ant eclipse\",\n\tit removes explicit Lucene-formatting.xml to avoid duplication (and potential inconsistencies) between project-specific formatter rules contained in org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs and the formatter's XML. The XML can be exported manually if needed.",
