    "description": "While trying to do some refactoring, I noticed funky things going on with some codecs.\n\nOne problem is that DocIdSetIterator says the following:\n\nReturns the following:\n   * <ul>\n   * <li>-1 or {@link #NO_MORE_DOCS} if {@link #nextDoc()} or\n   * {@link #advance(int)} were not called yet.\n\n\n\nBut most 4.0 Docs/DocsAndPositionsEnums don't actually do this (e.g. return 0). instead we \nare relying on Scorers to 'cover' for them, which is inconsistent. Some scorers actually rely\nupon this behavior, for example look at ReqExclScorer.toNonExcluded(), it calls docId() on the\nexcluded part before it calls nextDoc()\n\nSo we need to either fix these enums, change these enums to not extend DocIdSetIterator (and redefine\nwhat the actual contract should be for these enums), change DocIdSetIterator, or something else.\n\nFixing the enums to return -1 here when they are uninitialized kinda sucks for the ones summing up\ndocument deltas...",
