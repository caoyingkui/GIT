The index files are mapped into address space, so handled like a SWAP file, that's the trick. They only consume as much memory from cache space as the operating system decides. Especially it does not consume memory from java heap! ",

Using more address space isn't completely free.\n\tJava mmap overhead - you don't get access to a raw byte[]\n\tuserspace-kernel transition times (i.e. for a read system call) differ between operating systems.  Linux is very good here, probably leading to less of a penalty for read vs mmap.\n\n ",
