Because the generic version of PQ does noch change anything, the resulting byte code is identical (you can compare that with a decompilation using JAD). The casts are added by the Java Compiler automatically.\nThe lessThan method is covariant overloaded (passed through) in subclasses by javac (like in the test): lessThan(Integer, Integer) will appear as such in the class byte code of the subclass, but javac will add lessThan(Object, Object) that delgates to the covariant overload (which may be a small perf impact). It is called by the compiled code of PQ using the (Object, Object) signature (PQ does not know anything about generics in its byte code). ",

The simpliest would be a subclass:\n\n\npublic class ScorerDocQueue extends PriorityQueue<HeapedScorerDoc> {...}\n\n\n\nI do not know how big the perf impact would be (if there is one). As mentioned before, there is a small oerhead, because the overriden abstract method lessThan(HeapedScorerDoc, HeapedScorerDoc) would be wrapped by javac as lessThan(Object, Object) - a small added cost (do not know how big or jvm optimizes away, which I hope) ",

            "content": "By the way, the covariant overload is optimized away by the compiler (not the JVM), if an anonymous or private (and therefore final) class is used. This is the code from the test:\n\n\nprivate static class IntegerQueue extends PriorityQueue<Integer> {\n    public IntegerQueue(int count) {\n        super();\n        initialize(count);\n    }\n\n    protected boolean lessThan(Integer a, Integer b) {\n        return (a < b);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIs compiled to the following code by Java 1.5 javac:\n\n\nprivate static class TestPriorityQueue$IntegerQueue extends PriorityQueue {\n\n    protected boolean lessThan(Object a, Object b) {\n        return ((Integer)a).intValue() < ((Integer)b).intValue();\n    }\n\n    public TestPriorityQueue$IntegerQueue(int count) {\n        initialize(count);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nSo normal usage in Lucene would have no impact (would be the same as before). Only if you override a generified PQ with a lessThan method not final or somehow accessible, the compiler has to add the wrapper.\n\nedit:\n\nIf you want to see, what I mean with \"wrapper\", look into https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12418140/AttributeSource.jad and there in getAttributeImplIterator(). The inline Iterator overrides next(), but the return type is generic -> compiler adds a \"volatile\" method (how JAD identifies it). ",
