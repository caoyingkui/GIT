    "description": "Today we pass information about the merge trigger to the merge policy. Yet, no matter if the MP finds a merge or not we call the MergeScheduler who runs & blocks even if we didn't find a merge. In some cases we don't even want this to happen but inside the MergeScheduler we have no choice to opt out since we don't know what triggered the merge. We should forward the infos we have to the MergeScheduler as well.",
