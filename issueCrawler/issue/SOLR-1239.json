            "content": "Both MultiCoreEmbeddedTest and MergeIndexesEmbeddedTest fail because cores are being loaded from the wrong directory after SOLR-1214\n\nThis happens because the TestHarness creates a CoreContainer using the current working directory as the solrHome. Now these multicore tests call CoreContainer#load specifying a directory from which config is to be loaded. The failure happens when a core is loaded using solrHome (current working directory) in the CoreContainer#create method.\n\nThe CoreContainer#load needs to use loader.getInstanceDir instead of solrHome. In fact I think solrHome should be set in CoreContainer#load using loader.getInstanceDir to handle such cases. "
