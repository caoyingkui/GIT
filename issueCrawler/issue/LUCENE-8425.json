Yet, if a users wants to take advantage of\n    searching also soft-deleted documents the only option today is to search\n    all documents even though some of them are hard deleted. The recommendation\n    is to not mix those but in exceptional cases ie. when a document hits a\n    non-aborting exception during indexing the document is marked as hard\n    deleted which is the correct action. In order to filter those out having\n    access to the hard live docs on the segment reader level allows to filter out\n    these documents.",
