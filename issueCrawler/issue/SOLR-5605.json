It looks like while testing some foreign (non-lucene) code converts the digit \"1\" to this small creature maybe through the use of default locale. As the Lucene code is forbidden-api checked, this seems to be a bug somewhere else - the stack trace shows the bug: net.sourceforge.argparse4j.helper.TextHelper calls String.format without Locale!). \n\n...and...\n\n\nThe problem is in Argparser4J:\n\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.sourceforge.argparse4j/argparse4j/0.3.2/net/sourceforge/argparse4j/helper/TextHelper.java#197\n\nThe code does the following:\n\nString fmt = String.format(\"%%%ds%%s\\n\", indentWidth);\nwriter.format(fmt,....)\n\nSo it uses the first String.format (without locale) to produce the format string of the second one. The %d will be the indentWidth, so the code is right-aligned. But the indent-with pattern is formatted using default locale, so the first line produces something like the following code:\n\"%\u0967s%s\" instead of \"%1s%s\"\n\nThis will fail format parsing in the second. In my opinion the whole code is a bug by itself. Creating a format pattern with another format pattern is slow and as shown: buggy!\n "

Hence no startup script or extra steps are required downstream, just one (fat) jar.
