All that should matter is that each of the schemaLocation keys listed correspond to an xml namespace being used. (ie: you changed http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee -> http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee in two places, but as long as those two places are the same it shouldn't matter what we use ... i think it could be \"http://giberish-foo/uwesays\" and it should still work).  \n\nSo it seems like maybe your jboss configuration has something wonky going on?\n\nI'm inclined to think we should be consistent with the examples in the 2.5 spec...\n\nhttp://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/servlet-2.5-mrel2-eval-oth-JSpec/servlet-2_5-mrel2-spec.pdf\n\n...(see pages 153 & 154) which use j2ee \u2013 but oddly enough the example snippets embedded in the 2.5 XSD (using xsd:documentation tags) use \"javaee\"...\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd\n\n...so apparently the spec and the xsd shipped with the spec are inconsistent?  which i guess means feel free to change it to follow the examples in the XSD?\n "

While this works on Tomcat7 & Jetty8, it does not work with Jboss5 (which apparently is doing strict verification).  This patch follows the information on page 109ff of the same specification and also the xsd file at http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd  (note:  There is no xsd file available at http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_5.xsd).
