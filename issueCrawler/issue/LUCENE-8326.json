            "content": "First looking at the API change, it would be good to understand the goals. \n\nThis change wraps 8 or 9 existing setters such as setMinTermLen with a \"configuration class\". There is also another class related to boosts. But everything is still just as mutable as before, so from my perspective it only adds additional indirection/abstraction which is undesired.\n\nIf we want to make MLT immutable or something like that, we should first figure out if that's worth it. From my perspective, I'm not sold on this for MoreLikeThis itself, since its lightweight and stateless, and since I can't see a way for MoreLikeThisQuery to cache efficiently.\n\nOn the other hand MoreLikeThisQuery is kind of a mess, but that isn't addressed with the refactoring. Really all queries should be immutable for caching purposes, and should all have correct equals/hashcode: but seems like its a lost cause with MoreLikeThisQuery since it does strange stuff in rewrite: its not really a per-segment thing. Because of how the query works, its not obvious to me if/how we can improve it with immutability...\n\nAlso currently MoreLikeThisQuery doesn't accept MoreLikeThis as a parameter or anything, and only uses it internally. So as it stands (also with this patch) it still has a \"duplicate\" API of all the parameters, which isn't great.\n\nSo I think if we want to change the API for this stuff, we should figure out what the goals are? If its just to say, consolidate api between MoreLikeThis and MoreLikeThisQuery, I can buy into that (although I have never used the latter myself, only the former). However the other queries use builders for such purposes so that's probably something to consider.\n\nFor the solr changes, my only comment would be that instead of running actual queries, isn't it good enough to just test that XYZ configuration produces a correct MLT object? Otherwise the test seems fragile from my perspective. ",

            "content": "Hi Robert,\n\nfirst of all thanks for your feedback, much appreciated.\n\nMy initial goal was to make More Like This original 1000 lines class:\n\n\tMore\u00a0Readable\n\tEasier to Maintain and Extend\n\tMore Testable\n\n\n\nSo I started identifying the different responsibilities in the More Like This class, to separate them, in the way that if I just need to change the scoring algorithm for the interesting terms I just touch the TermScorer ect ect :\nYou see the overall idea in these slides : https://www.slideshare.net/AlessandroBenedetti/advanced-document-similarity-with-apache-lucene\n\nI tried to modify as less as possible the logic and tests at this stage.\n\nSo let me wrap my considerations under different topics :\n\nParameters Abstraction\nI see your point for just additional indirection/abstraction ( it is exactly just that with readability in mind).\nMy scope for this was :\n\"We have 600 lines of code of default and parameters for the MLT. How to make them isolated, more readable and extendable ?\"\nAnd I initially thought to just put them in a separate class to remove that responsibility from the original MLT .\nSo the focus was exclusively better readability and easy maintenance\u00a0at this stage.\nCan you elaborate why you think this is undesired ?\nI don't have any strong feeling regarding this bit, so I am open to suggestions with the forementioned objective in mind.\n\nMLT Immutable\nI didn't consider it , but I am completely open to do that.\nIn such case it could be worth to add a MoreLikeThis factory that manages the parameters and create the immutable MLT object ?\n\nMoreLikeThisQuery\nIt was not in the scope of this refactor but I am absolutely happy to tackle that immediately as a next step, it could give it a try to see if there is space for improvement there.\n\nSolr Tests\n\nI completely agree, indeed as part of my additional tests which I have ready for the sequent refactors I introducedmuch more tests Lucene side than Solr side.\nWe can elaborate this further at the right moment ",

To the user it does not matter, they just see one class with getters and setters and its easy.\n\nIf it really needs to be split up, can we try to do it in a way that doesn't impact users, e.g. move some code into package-private implementation classes?
