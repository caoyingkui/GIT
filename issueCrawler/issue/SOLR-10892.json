    "description": "We've overused a bit the concept of using tables to explain various config parameters. We have some tables that are massive and try to cram a ton of complex information into a row (see function-queries.adoc), while other tables are only 1 or 2 rows. It's not impossible, but it's also difficult to link directly to parameters when they are in a table\n\nAsciiDoc format now allows us to use \"description lists\" or \"definition lists\" which in many cases might be better. This issue would change many of the current tables to definition lists. However, some of them may remain, depending on how they work within the content.",

I haven't yet decided to eliminate these intro tables or try to keep it in some fashion.\n\nFor the query parser pages, a table might really be handy to consolidate all the various query params in one place - maybe a new page, or a new table on an existing page - noting in the table which parser supports each param; then the individual pages could omit the table and only have a description list.
