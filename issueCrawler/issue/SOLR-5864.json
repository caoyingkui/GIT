    "description": "Currently the reload method is reload(SolrResourceLoader resourceLoader, SolrCore prev), but all the times it\u2019s called with \u201cprev\u201d being the same as \u201cthis\u201d:\ncore.reload(resourceLoader, core). \nFrankly, I don\u2019t think it even makes sense to call it in other way (it would be just to create the first reader with a different core than the one its being reloaded?)\nI think we should just remove the SolrCore parameter and let the \"reload\" method always reload the core where it's being called.",
