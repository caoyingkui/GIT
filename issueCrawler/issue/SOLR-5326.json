    "description": "The problem we saw was that splitting one shard took 'a long time' (around 4 hours) and with there being 'many' (8 at the time) shards to split and the solr overseer serialising action=SPLITSHARD requests a full collection split would have taken 'a very long time'.\n\nSeparately, shard splitting distributing replica2, replica3, etc. of each shard randomly across machines was not desirable and as in SOLR-5004 splitting into 'n' rather than '2' sub-shards was useful.",

The extra information at the end of the shard= parameters eventually of course should go into separate parameters. "
