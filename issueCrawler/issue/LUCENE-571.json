    "description": "The standard tokenizer in 1.9.1 returns a decimal number such as \"3.14\" as a <HOST>, though a number like \"3,141.59\" is returned as a <NUM>. I believe, though I haven't tried it yet, that moving the rule for <HOST> after <NUM>, instead of before it, will obviate this. Or updating <HOST> to require a TLD as the last component, which would require you to split the interpretation of IP addresses from name-based addresses.",
