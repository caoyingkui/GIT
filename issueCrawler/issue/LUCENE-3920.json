Its not related to shingles (its just that shingles is a word-combiner).\njust running the test on LUCENE-3919, I've tripped this with some other combinations,\nlike NGramTokenizer + HyphenatedWordsFilter, if the text ends with a hyphen:\n\n\n    [junit] TEST FAIL: useCharFilter=true text='wonxkil ?-?-'\n    [junit] Exception from random analyzer: tokenizer=class org.apache.lucene.analysis.ngram.NGramTokenizer\n    [junit] filters=class org.apache.lucene.analysis.miscellaneous.HyphenatedWordsFilter,class org.apache.lucene.analysis.ga.IrishLowerCaseFilter,class org.apache.lucene.analysis.hi.HindiStemFilter\n\n\n\nThe problem is as Mike mentions on LUCENE-3907, the n-grams perform \"multiple passes\".\nSo imagine the text is 'abcd', if you ngram(1,2), they emit:\na, b, c, d, ab, bc, cd\ninstead of something like:\na, ab, b, bc, c, cd, d, ...\n\nBecause if this, if someone 'joins' the d and ab, they create a term with a startOffset > endOffset...
