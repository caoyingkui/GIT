They sum up their docFreq themselves to prevent the \n  first wasted seek in TermQuery. \n\tSo this solution would make MTQ worse, as it would cause them to trash the caches in the\n  second wasted seek (the docsenum) where they do not today, with negative entries for the \n  segments where the term doesn't exist. Today they do this wasted seek, but they don't \n  trash the cache here. The only solution to prevent that is the PerReaderTermState \n  (or something equally complicated).\n\tWe would have to look at other places where negative entries would hurt, for example\n  rebuilding spellcheck indexes uses this 'termExists()' method implemented with docFreq. \n  So we would have to likely change spellcheck's code to use a TermsEnum and \n  seek(term, false)... using a termsenum in parallel with the spellcheck dictionary would \n  obviously be more efficient for the index-based spellcheck case (forget about caching)\n  versus docFreq()'ing every term... but we cannot assume the spellcheck \"Dictionary\" \n  is actually in term order, (imagine the File-based dictionary case), so we can't \n  implement this today.\n\n\n\nOn 3.x i think its slightly less complicated as there is already a hack in the cache to \nprevent sequential termsenums from trashing it (e.g. foo*), and pretty much all the MTQs \njust enumerate sequentially anyway... (except NRQ which doesn't enum many terms \nanyway, likely not a problem).\n\nBut we would have to at least fix the spellcheck case there too I think.\n\nNot saying I don't like your idea... just saying there's more work to do it.
