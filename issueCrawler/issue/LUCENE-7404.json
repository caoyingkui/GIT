    "description": "Lucene is very powerfull but has a limitation very important. It is impossible to use when you want create a query where is a expression inside. \nfield1: >= field2  where field1 and field2 is not possible.\nfield1:= field2^2 -4 *field3 \nit is pratically impossible to index statically document for this query but it is possible to do 2 things:\n1) create a third field hidden here is saved the result.\n2) when you use a prepared query , it is saved automatically in a different writer this info that you can save. \nCreating a prepared query lucene do all automatically for making this query using indexes. \n\nPS. Pay attention that fields in expression could be not only inside the current document but also in different documents/readers.\nIt could be used also for join different document types(it is a subcase of the above problem).",
