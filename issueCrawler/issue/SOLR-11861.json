There were some issues so I updated a new patch:\n\n\tmodified the v2 API docs to account for the fact that this parameter is no longer required\n\tmodified the ref guide to mention this parameter now has a default.\n\tchanged the ConfigSetHandler action code:\n\t\n\t\tuse the SolrParams.get(name,default) overloaded version instead doing a null check after which is more verbose\n\t\tchanged the \"props\" line back to how it was, though removing BASE_CONFIGSET_NAME since that part isn't required.  You changed it to use a deprecated method on SolrParams, so I reverted.\n\t\n\t\n\timproved OverseerConfigSetMessageHandler to use the overloaded version of ZkNodeProps.getStr(name,default) instead doing a null check after which is more verbose\n\n\n\nUpon reflection, it's pretty sad such a simple change has to touch so many things.
