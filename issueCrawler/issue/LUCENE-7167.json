I looked at this part of geo3d recently because I was looking at how the various 2d implementations handled quantization and rounding, and so I thought, maybe geo3d needs to be fixed too in that area.\n\nI had no idea what i was in for: geo3d explicitly discards any edge case testing. So if its gonna do that, why does it do this ridiculous garbage to try to \"correct\" for quantization. If we truncate someone's data at index time this cannot be undone. It cannot be corrected for. So making this complex XYZSolidFactory that, produces one of 8 possible XYZ's (which are all public too!!!! why have a factory!!!!!!!), this is so complex to try to \"correct\" for damage we have already done.\n\nIt does not work and if any edge cases were being tested at all we should see that. Removing all of this would be a great simplification for geo3d, it would remove a ton of public classes. "

Once the point is indexed though the quantized (x,y,z) is the benchmark, not the raw unquantized value.  Geo3D is correct either way \u2013 it doesn't lie, it tells you whether the point is on or out, period.\n\nSo what you are looking at is code explicitly for testing, nothing more.\n\nMichael McCandless: You wrote the test \u2013 can you help clarify please?

We decide to use a lossy encoding, that is fine, but we should not try to \"correct for it\" at query time: we just have to accept that but then treat it as if the user handed us that truncated value from there on out and not allow any more lossiness/error to sneak in.
