    "description": "as noted on the mailing list...\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Solr-1.3-Maven-Artifact-Problem-to20132273.html#a20132273\n\n\nI am using the Solr 1.3 mave nartifacts from [1]. It seems that these artifacts are\nnot correct. I have noticed that:\n1) solr-core artifact contains org.apache.solr.client.solrj packages, and at the same\ntime, the solr-core artifact depends on the solr-solrj artifact.\n\n\n\nat a minimum we should resolve this discrepancy, but more generally we should consider  moving anything currently in solrj that solr \"core\" has a compile/run dependency on into solr-common ... possibly to the point of eliminating the solr-solrj jar altogether.\n\nmarking fix for 1.4 as a reminder to consider/decide before the next release.",
