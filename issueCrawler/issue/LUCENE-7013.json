    "description": "In LUCENE-7012 we committed a change to the IDE templates to place the license header before the package declaration in new Java files.\n\nI wrote a simple Python script which moves the header before the package declaration. To be on the safe side, if a .java file does not already start with the license header or with package org.apache, it doesn't modify it and asks for manual intervention.\n\nIt runs quite fast, so I don't mind running and committing one module at a time.",

In most cases, when the license appears exactly after the package declaration, the diff is minimal.\n\nIf there are no objections, I'll run it over modules and commit each one separately. "

Probably my only substantive suggestion is that you can use Python's heredoc/multi-line-string format for the license text.  This lets you avoid suffixing each line with \"\\r\\n\".  FWIW, I don't think this has any affect on the correctness of your script, just a stylistic thing.  Shouldn't matter either way; just wanted to mention in case you were planning on committing the script for use down the road. "

I am fine with cleaning all that up, but the real bug is in Eclipse (MARS.1 only?).\n\nAs Shai already mentioned the following things are broken:\n\n\tIf Eclipse automatically adds an import, it places it behind the package name (before license), this splits your imports into 2 parts\n\tIf you call organize imports it fcks up completely: All imports disappear in most cases, but they are still there!!! (open the file with text editor after saving).\n\n\n\nThis is really a bug and the changes we do here are just a workaround. "

I noticed them when I improved the validation tasks to detect broken license headers, formatted as javadocs (see root's build.xml). The checker now uses Apache RAT to \"detect\" license headers before processing them. Its a dynamic replacement of the static, huge regex: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/build.xml#L127-L219\n\nWe also have files with non-ASF license headers (BSD or Porter Stemmer license). Those are all fine, maybe the header should be moved up, but as those are partially autogenerated we should not touch (and is unlikely - better \"forbidden\" - that you edit them with a GUI). "
