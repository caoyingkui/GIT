            "content": "Here is a patch. The IndexAndSearchOpenstreetMaps benchmark as-is does not show any change in QPS, which is expected since it only indexes points and performs queries around London, so at least this change is not making things slower. But I hacked the benchmark to add 180 to all longitudes in documents/queries and the QPS went from 17 to 39 with this patch. ",
