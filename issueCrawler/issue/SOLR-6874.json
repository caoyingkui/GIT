    "description": "I ran into this while working on SOLR-4509 and have a fix there in my latest patch. Because we get an available port by opening and closing a scocket on port 0 and then try to use it again with the SocketProxy, sometimes it fails to bind and the test can fail. We can change the code a bit so that the SocketProxy itself can start on port 0 rather than this two step fragile process.",
