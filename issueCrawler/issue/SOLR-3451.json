Supporting JSON would take lots of extra work.\n\nIf you need JSON. just use the wt=JSON option.  If you need solrj \u2013 you should be able to ignore how things get passed around under the covers.  If you need JSON generated from a solrj respone.... take a look at any number of JSON libraries out there. "
