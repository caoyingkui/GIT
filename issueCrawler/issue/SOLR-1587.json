    "description": "When doing an HTTP request to a Solr Server using the shards parameter (\"shards\") the behavior of the response varies.\n\nThe following requests cause the entire document (all fields) to return in the response:\n\n    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*\n    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*&fl=score\n    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*&shards=shardLocation/solr/cpaCore\n\nThe following request causes only the fields \"id\" and \"score\" to return in the response:\n\n    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*&fl=score&shards=shardLocation/solr/cpaCore\n\nI don't know if this is by design but it does provide for some inconsistent behavior, as shard requests behave differently than regular requests.",
