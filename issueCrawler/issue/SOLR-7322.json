    "description": "There are a few places in the code that set up hadoop Configurations, e.g. HdfsUpdateLog, HdfsDirectoryFactory.  In apache sentry, we also set up a Configuration with the same properties as the above two (i.e. reading the hdfs.conf.dir resources).  It would help to unify these usages.\n\nSimilar to say, the HBaseConfiguration: https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/0a500e5d305b0c75a6a357a5ff7a9210a615a007/hbase-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/HBaseConfiguration.java\n\nMaybe would want to make Configuration itself a forbidden API and force everyone to use our version as well.",
