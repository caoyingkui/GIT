This did not happen in the 1.3 release.\nFor example, if I index the term \"PowerShot.com\" and search for pow* the highlighting snippet contains <em>Power</em><em>PowerShot.com</em>.\nI will attach a patch which adds tests to the highlighter unittest to demonstrate the issue.",

            "content": "Hi,\n\nI investigated this some more.  The problem seems to be in:\n\norg.apache.lucene.search.highlight.TokenSource.java\n\npublic static TokenStream getTokenStream(TermPositionVector tpv, boolean tokenPositionsGuaranteedContiguous) {\n\n   has at the end the following code to sort the tokens into original document order.\n\n            Arrays.sort(tokensInOriginalOrder, new Comparator(){\n                public int compare(Object o1, Object o2)\n                {\n                    Token t1=(Token) o1;\n                    Token t2=(Token) o2;\n                    if(t1.startOffset()>t2.endOffset())\n                        return 1;\n                    if(t1.startOffset()<t2.startOffset())\n                        return -1;\n                    return 0;\n                }});\n\nThis is not sorting the tokens into the right original order.  The order should be\n\nlorem, power, powershotcom, shot, com, ipsum for this to work correctly.  Instead we are getting lorem, power, com, powershotcom, shot, ipsum which confuses TokenGroup.isDistinct().\n\nI would be happy to fix this bug.  \n\nShould we fix this as a Lucene bug or fix it in Solr by creating a new TokenStream that handles overlapping tokens correctly.
