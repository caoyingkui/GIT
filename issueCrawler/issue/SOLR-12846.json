    "description": "The policy documentation says that there is a host variable supported in policy rules at https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_5/solrcloud-autoscaling-policy-preferences.html#node-selection-attributes\n\nBut there is no mention of it in the code. Perhaps it got lost during refactorings and there were no tests for it? In any case, we should add it back. It'd be great if we can support #EACH for host so that one can write a rule to distribute replicas across hosts and not just nodes. This would be very useful when one runs multiple Solr JVMs in the same physical node.",
