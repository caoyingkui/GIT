    "description": "Our builds failed with Java 9 build 118 because by default several Java EE features were disabled by default in Java 9. This affects JAXB and CORBA, which are no longer visible by default.\n\nLucene is clean of those features but Solr uses javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter in SimplePostTool, which is not visible by default in Java 9. Interestingly it uses this to encode the username/password to BASE64. Since Java 8 there is java.util.Base64, so we don't need the hack anymore.",

But we have to check stuff like TIKA that may use the activation or JAXB libraries. If needed we will need to add some \"-addmods\" in the startup scripts for Java 9. ",
