At first sight it looks:\n\n\tnot due to unclosed index inputs or MockDirectoryWrapper would barf too\n\tnot related to the unmap hack since we have failures on tests that do not use MmapDirectory at all like TestNIOFSDirectory\n\tnot due to the fact that we do not release resources in a try/finally or try-with-resources block or junit would report the exception that prevented the dir/input from being closed as well\n\n\n\nIt's also surprising how it sometimes fails with a DirectoryNotEmptyException without reporting issues about deleting inner files of the directory.\n\nI don't have much background on this issue so I could easily have missed something.",

This is what it looks like.\n\nIt's also surprising how it sometimes fails with a DirectoryNotEmptyException without reporting issues about deleting inner files of the directory.\n\nThe test rule in TestRuleTemporaryFilesCleanup doesn't list them... and looking at the implementation of afterAlways I think you could try to scan it again and see what exactly is remaining. The implementation of temp. directory supplier in randomizedtesting does this sort of thing and reports those files (I can't remember why we have a separate facility for this in Lucene; perhaps for flexibility or to substitute different fs implementations).
