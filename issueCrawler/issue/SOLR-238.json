            "content": "Thorsten ... thanks for the prod on this issue.  One thing that makes this tricky is that the tutorial (and the entire website) are bundled with every release ... that's why we keep the site up to date with the trunk, so that people can review the docs as time goes on, but when a release is cut people using that release should refer to the docs that come with it.\n\nI'm not very knowledgeable in forest, do you (or anyone else watching this issue) know if there is an easy way to do variable substitution into the generated docs when they are build using property files (or something like it)\n\nThen the docs could always contain the current Solr spec version number when the tutorial is regenerated (for official releases, the spec version number looks like 1.1, 1.2, etc... for nightly builds it looks like 1.1.2007.05.11.10.10.53 \u2013 the last official version number followed by the current datetime)\n "

Thorsten, a couple of quick questions...\n\n1) is the file name \"symbols-project-v10.ent\" significant in some way, or can we make it something a little easier for people to understand, like \"solr-specific-forrest-variables.ent\" ?\n\n(in particular, the \"v10\" jumps out at me as being confusing and odd .. version 10 of what?)\n\n2) is there any reason why forrest would care if the symbols file lives in the resources directory, or can it live anywhere as long as the relative URI in the <!ENTITY> declaration points at the right spot?\n\n3) what is the purpose of the catalog.xcat file your patch adds?

I will add a new version.\n\n2)\na) no, you can change it in the forrest.properties: \n#project.schema-dir=${project.resources-dir}/schema\nis the default. \nYou can change it to something like \nproject.schema-dir=src/schema\nif you want, just uncomment the property.\nb) not sure about the path better use the forrest.properties.\n\n3) As I understand it (used it the first time in this contribution) it links to the *. ent file, giving the benefit that you can import it to your favorite xml editor:\nhttp://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/catalog.html\nfurther (as I understand it) forrest is using it to look up the *.ent file.
