    "description": "When running a single test in IntelliJ, something about the way the tests are run causes the UI to display all the tests in the class other than the one that was run as if they had been ignored. In contrast, running a single test in a typical test case class not derived from LuceneTestCase shows only the status of that test case method, not all the other methods in the class.\n\nThis is somewhat irritating since it makes it hard to see what's going on with the test of interest.\n\nThis is with IntelliJ 2017.1.4, junit 4.12",

The second one shows what happens when you run a single method in the same class \u2013 you see all the methods in orange and the one you ran in green (it passed). The last one shows what happens when you run a single method in another class (not a LuceneTestCase), which also has a lot of other methods that didn't get run, and are not displayed: just the one method shown passing.\n\nAlso \u2013 just to be totally explicit, I ran the single test cases by right-clicking and in that test runner output window, but the same thing happens if you run them from elsewhere, at least for all the options I know about.

Unfortunately the IDEs are pretty dumb and what we do in randomized testing stretches JUnit assumptions a bit (for example we append randomization seed to each method execution if a single test is repeated).\n\nI filed an issue here and will think how to best handle it without breaking other stuff.\nhttps://github.com/randomizedtesting/randomizedtesting/issues/251 ",
