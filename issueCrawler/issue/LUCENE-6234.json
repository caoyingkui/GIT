It runs the backcompat tests, and scrapes the test output to check all are tested.\n\nThe context was that i (out of habit from older versions of this script) was trying to do this in my personal tmp space (expecting the script to create it's RC specific tmp dir in the CWD)...\n\n\nhossman@frisbee:~/tmp$ python3.2 ~/lucene/branch_5_0/dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py http://people.apache.org/~anshum/staging_area/lucene-solr-5.0.0-RC2-rev1658469\n\n\n\nIf smokeTestRelease.py is going to have expectations about it's CWD, then it should either enforce those expectations (ie: do a simple assert in main() that the CWD meets some expectations, and/or check \"$0\") or it should use \"$0\" to figure out where the root svn checkout is and cd to that directory itself.",
