            "content": "We will remove this class as it is not really used in Lucene and Solr, it's just a convenience class.\n\nIn fact it's not really a security issue, because it is just a way for an application to use template XML files for the XML query parser where properties can be replaced. The XML file is not intended to be loaded from untrusted sources. Anybody doing this has misunderstood the whole class anyways and will fail to use it. So this looks like just an issue reported by some automated code safety testing tool.\n\nFor the template manager the use case is: You have an XML/XSL file as a query template in your local JAR resources folder and you use properties to replace the property placeholders in the XML before passing it to XML query parser. If used correctly there is never any external possibility to inject XML. So there is no need to fix this. If there is the possibility to pass in an untrusted XML file it's the application's fault, not Lucene's.\n\nNevertheless, as the above functionality can be done outside of Lucene easily; so let's remove this class. Its mostly untested and not used in the wild (github search). ",
