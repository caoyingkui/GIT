    "description": "This is related to the ResultSetImpl for column indices but requires that more metadata be based back from the SQL handler in relation to column names. The SQL handler already knows about the column names and order but they aren't passed back to the client. SQL clients used the column names to display so this must be implemented for DBVisualizer to work properly.",

            "content": "Working with this patch now. I made some changes to how numerics are handled. I believe all numerics will be converted to longs or doubles during the json de-serialization. To support SQL properly we need to support getInt, getFloat, getShort, getByte along with getLong and getDouble. So I changed the Numeric handling to cast to a Number and return the corresponding primitive type. If we want to add some safeguards to protect against truncation and loss of precision we can come back and do that in another ticket.  ",
