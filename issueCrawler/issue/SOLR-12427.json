So, I have added it in TestGroupingSearch (As grouping also goes through the same code block). Please move it to a better place.\n\n\n\n\n\tWhile working on this, I have observed that\nIn params.getInt(String param), when an exception is thrown the error message doesn't include for which param it has failed. (This is true for all number conversions in SolrParams)\n\n\n\nThis can be changed to something like this. This helps user as it is more verbose.\n\n  public Integer getInt(String param) {\n    String val = get(param);\n    try {\n      return val==null ? null : Integer.valueOf(val);\n    }\n    catch( Exception ex ) {\n      throw new SolrException( SolrException.ErrorCode.BAD_REQUEST, \"for param\" + param + \"error\" + ex.getMessage(), ex );\n    }\n  }\n\n\nI haven't made the change in this patch because the change is not related to this issue.
