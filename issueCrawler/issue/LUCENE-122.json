    "description": "If would be helpfull to be able to pass in an analyzer for \nIndexWriter.addDocument() method.  I am using an analyzer that\ntakes a Locale object so that it can index document with\ndifferent languages with the correct STOPWORDS, stemmer filter,\nand lowercase rules.  Thus, when I index a list of documents\nI want to be able to index based on the language of the document,\nand to do that I need to pass in the languge to the Anaylzer.  So,\nif I could pass in the analyzer during addDocument() that would solve\nthe problem.",
