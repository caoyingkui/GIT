            "content": "A review of all Solr issues that mention last_index_time turns up SOLR-4051 (via SOLR-1970) as a possible candidate for the commit that broke this functionality.  This assumes of course that it worked after the feature was added by SOLR-783, which is probably a safe assumption.\n\nSOLR-4051 says that it patches functionality that was introduced to 3.6.  I think that was added by SOLR-2382, so it might have been SOLR-2382 that broke things.\n\nIf I get some time in the near future I will attempt to write a test that illustrates the bug, and see if I can run that test on 3.6 as well.  If anyone out there can try a manual test on 3.6, that would save some time.\n\nSide note: the code uses two constants for \"last_index_time\" - LAST_INDEX_TIME and LAST_INDEX_KEY.  Those should probably be combined. "

Hopefully someone can tell me what I did wrong.\n\nAttaching entitytest.patch. "
