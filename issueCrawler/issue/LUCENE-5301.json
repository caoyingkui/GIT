    "description": "It would be convenient if all PackedInts had a super-class with the long get(long index) method. Maybe this super-class could even be NumericDocValues so that doc values formats don't need to wrap eg. BlockPackedReader into this kind of construct:\n\n        final BlockPackedReader reader = new BlockPackedReader(data, entry.packedIntsVersion, entry.blockSize, entry.count, true);\n        return new LongNumericDocValues() {\n          @Override\n          public long get(long id) {\n            return reader.get(id);\n          }\n        };\n\n\n\nInstead, they could just\n\n        return new BlockPackedReader(data, entry.packedIntsVersion, entry.blockSize, entry.count, true);",

Since the other impls are protected by a hard check (the array bounds check), I wanted to be consistent and have a hard check for these bounds as well, otherwise an out-of-bounds long could be casted to a valid integer. But maybe it would be better to only have an assertion. Will update the patch. ",
