This should have been brought up on the mailing list or the IRC channel, to confirm whether or not there's a bug before opening an issue.\n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc\n\nThere, we can give you steps for debugging the problem.  If it turns out that there is a bug, then we can re-open this issue.  Note that even if there is a bug, it will have to be confirmed in the latest version (currently 7.3.0).  A problem like this is not severe enough to warrant a new 7.1.x version. ",

            "content": "The patch also removes wildcard imports and makes a few formatting adjustments.  I looked at all usages of HashMap as well as HashSet in DocBuilder and adjusted one of the HashMap usages to LinkedHashMap.\n\nIn the JdbcDataSource class, there were a couple of warnings from my IDE about unnecessary else clauses, so I adjusted those too, and removed the wildcard imports found there.  (I was looking at JdbcDataSource to confirm which class would log SQL statements, if that became necessary)\n\nI've looked into the arguments on both sides of the debate on wildcard versus specific imports.  I think the potential problems with wildcard imports far outweigh any level of convenience for somebody who wants to avoid hand-typing a lot of import statements. ",
