Add a \"headers\" NamedList to SolrQueryResponse, to hold values that are meant for the responseHeader, makes these values available to all QueryResponseWriters. \n\n2. Have SolrCore put the computed \"qtime\" value in there (along with other stats if needed) instead of computing it in the QueryResponseWriter.\n\n3. In SolrCore.execute(), call a method to copy (if so configured) the explicit request parameters to a nested NamedList stored in the above \"headers\" NamedList. \n\nIf people need more than the explicit parameters, this would be the place to change later on, but right now this will be explicit params only.\n\n4. In QueryResponseWriters, implement generic code to copy the \"headers\" NamedList to the output\n\nI think this puts everything in the right place - comments are welcome of course. "

(SOLR-59) -->\n    <echoParameters explicit=\"true\"/>\n  </response>\n\nDefault parameters are not dumped for now, adding them should only require changing SolrQueryResponseHeaders.setStandardHeaders(). \n\nAlso, DefaultSolrParams.getParameterNamesIterator() now returns all parameters thanks to the new IteratorChain utility class (is there a better way without copying collections? sounds fairly hairy for a simple thing). \n "

That would also allow request handlers to add stuff to the header in the future (if they really needed to):\n\nSo SolrCore.execute could look something like this perhaps:\n\n  public void execute(SolrQueryRequest req, SolrQueryResponse rsp) {\n    SolrRequestHandler handler = getRequestHandler(req.getQueryType());\n    if (handler==null) \n{\n      log.warning(\"Unknown Request Handler '\" + req.getQueryType() +\"' :\" + req);\n      throw new SolrException(400,\"Unknown Request Handler '\" + req.getQueryType() + \"'\", true);\n    }\n    NamedList responseHeader = new NamedList();\n    rsp.add(\"responseHeader\", responseHeader);\n    handler.handleRequest(req,rsp);\n    int qtime=(int)(rsp.getEndTime() - req.getStartTime());\n    // might want to re-get responseHeader here, or mandate that request handers\n    // do not replace the responseHeader in the SolrQueryResponse they are handed.\n    responseHeader.add(\"status\",rsp.getException()==null ? 0 : 500);\n    responseHeader.add(\"QTime\",qtime);\n    // Values for echoParams... false/true/all or false/explicit/all ???\n    if (\"explicit\".equals(req.getParams().get(\"echoParams\")))\n        responseHeader.add(\"params\", asNamedList_TBD(req.getOriginalParams()));\n    log.info(req.getParamString()+ \" 0 \" + qtime);\n  } "
