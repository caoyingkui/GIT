The library in mind is \"morfologik-stemming\", here:\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/morfologik/\n\nThe code of this library is BSD-licensed and consists mainly of traversal of FSA automata. The stemmer is dictionary based, so it is nearly (ambiguities) 100% accurate for words in the dictionary and 0% accurate for non-dictionary words (returns null).\n\nThe problem with Morfologik is that its dictionary data is LGPL-ed, so it would have to be a separate download. \n\nThis is just a suggestion for discussion. I guess this functionality is limited to a very narrow audience anyway.\n ",
