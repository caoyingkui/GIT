You can easily get into trouble if a query is shared.\n\nTo avoid changing queries, you would have to follow the same strategy as rewrite()... \nYou would need to clone the query object, then set constantScoring, then call rewrite (which may clone it again).  Not the best for performance...\n\nOne solution is to communicate the fact that we want a constant scoring query in the rewrite method itself:  rewrite(Query query, int flags)\n ",

If the other idea falls through, then this code could be \"promoted\" from contrib to the core (and perhaps then QueryParser could be changed to use it by default).  If the other plan does get implimented, then these classes can be deprecated in favor of the new ones (and their new API) ",
