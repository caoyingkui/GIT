            "content": "I don't really follow why we need to change code in Solr (or add code) to make use of Logback?  All solr code should use SLF4J which is a framework, so swapping log4j -> logback should just be a matter of replacing the relevant Jar files, and adding a logback.xml to configure logback itself...\n\nWe do that already (in Solr 4.x admittedly) as part of our deployment process, but no code changes are needed.\n\nAlso Solr doesn't tend to use Pull Requests, since the gold copy host is SVN (github is just a mirror for convenience), all changes would have to be submitted as a patch instead of a PR.
