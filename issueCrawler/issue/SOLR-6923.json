            "content": "The actual runtime state of a replica is determined by 1) what's in clusterstate.json and 2) check that the node hosting the replica is live. If the node is not live, the state reported in clusterstate.json can be \"stale\" for some time. It has always worked this way in SolrCloud. Thus, AutoAddReplicas needs to consult live nodes prior to thinking a node is live. ",
