    "description": "It turns out searching arbitrary fields with define FUZZY_SLOP values could be problematic on some types of values. For example a FUZZY_SLOP on dates is ambiguous and needs a definition of a unit like months, days, minutes, etc. An extension on the query grammar that allows some arbitrary text behind the values in combination with a possibility to override the method parsing those values could solve these kinds of problems.",

I.e. those units can be used for dates to specify a slop interval to be defined in month, days, hours, etc.\n\nFile: LUCENE-4745-raw.patch contains the changes on the query grammar and the QueryParserBase\n\nFile: LUCENE-4745-full.patch also contains changes on the auto-generated parser classes.

Well maybe since you don't be a query parser error if you do \"foo~2bar\" vs. \"foo~2 bar\". I personally have no strong feelings about this particular problem, anybody else? ",
