Right now, the initial fetch includes all data we need for showing 'verbose infos' therefore the Checkbox will only inline-switch the table - changing the url will trigger a reload. If you think it would be good to have that as variable as well, let me know and i'll change it. No longer that fancy, but it's more important to have a over-all usability  "

Maybe use the bright blue color?  as is, the match terms are too subtle "
