    "description": "Currently the one-time-upgrade depends on whether the upgraded .si file exists. And the writing is done in a try/finally so its removed if ioexception happens.\n\nbut I think there could be a power-loss or something else in the middle of this, the upgraded .si file could be bogus, then the user would have to manually remove it (they probably wouldnt know).\n\ni think instead we should just have a marker file on completion, that we create after we successfully fsync the upgraded .si file. this way if something happens we just rewrite the thing.",
