    "description": "If delta-import is executed many times, the heap utilization grows up and finally OutOfMemoryError occurs.\n\nWhen delta-import is executed with SqlEntityProcessor, the instances of TemplateString cached in VariableResolverImpl#TEMPLATE_STRING#cache.\nIf the deltaQuery contains variable like `last_index_time', the cached values never used increases.\nSimilarly, I guess that the cache increases when fetching each modified row with primary key.\nI think these queries should not be cached. \n\nI came up with two solutions:\n\n 1) Not to cache queries to get modified rows.\n 2) Make VariableResolverImpl#TEMPLATE_STRING non-static. Or clear cache on finishing delta-import.\n\nI think that #1 is better for performance than #2, but #2 is easier to solve the problem.\n\nI made a patch in #2 way, and then tested two solr applications with `-XX:+PrintClassHistgram' option.\nThe result after importing several million rows from a MySQL database is as follows:\n\n\n\toriginal solr-1.3:\n num     #instances         #bytes  class name\n----------------------------------------------\n...\n  6:       2983024      119320960  org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.TemplateString\n...\n\n\n\n\n\tpatched solr-1.3:\n num     #instances         #bytes  class name\n----------------------------------------------\n...\n 748:             3            120  org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.TemplateString\n...\n\n\n\nThough it is version 1.3 that I tested, perhaps current nightly version has same problem.",
