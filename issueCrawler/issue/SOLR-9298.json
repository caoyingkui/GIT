            "content": "Christine, I think your patch is the right fix.  I'd do one extra thing though: get rid of the <excludes><exclude>**/*.java</exclude></excludes>, which only makes sense when resources are co-located in a src/java/ or src/test/ directory.  (Trivial point here though since src/resources/ doesn't contain any .java files right now.)\n\nInitially I thought the existing resource (all non-.java files in the module) should be preserved, but when I did that (by adding a separate <resource> for src/resources/ instead of replacing it as your patch does), I can see that the jar actually contains the test keystore twice, one at the root (from the src/resources/ <resource>), and another at src/resources/, and the latter is useless (and the cause of this issue).\n\nI'm running tests with your patch locally now.

Also looks like the Lucene core tests were skipped for some reason.  I'll investigate. ",
