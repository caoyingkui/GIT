However the test failed, and I found out that this is because the input stream returned by CompressorStreamFactory.createCompressorInputStream() does not close its underlying stream when it is exhausted or when its close method is called. \n\nI opened COMPRESS-127 for this.\n\nAs a workaround to this bug, ContentSource now returns a wrapper on the input stream created by the CsFactory, delegates all methods to it, except for close() which is also delegated to the underlying stream. This fix is required for the extension letter cases tests to pass, but it fixes a more serious problem, - leaking file handles in ContentSource.\n\nAs Solr also makes use of CommonCompress I searched in it for references to CompressorStreamFactory.createCompressorInputStream() but found none, so it seems Solr is not affected by COMPRESS-127.

I wouldn't use file.delete() as in indicator because on Linux it will pass\n\nChanged my mind about adding this test to ContentSourceTest - I think such a test fits more to the CommonCompress project, because it should directly call CompressorStreamFactory.createCompressorInputStream(in). In our test we invoke ContentSource.getInputStream(File) and so we cannot pass such a close-sensing stream. \n\nBut this is a valid point, especially, the test case I provided to COMPRESS-127 will fail on Windows but will likely pass on Linux. I'll add a reference to your comment in COMPRESS-127. ",
