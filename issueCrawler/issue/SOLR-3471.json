    "description": "The following tests are failing on Windows quite often:\n\n\n\tSoftAutoCommitTest (all tests): There seem to be wrong assumes - I dont like the test \"testing\" how fast something is (there are slow machines or machines with <= 2 cores)\n\tTestSolrDeletionPolicy1.testCommitAge() - also maybe timing issue. Otherwise I think the custom Solr DeletionPolicy is not respecting the fact that Windows cannot delete open files\n\tTestRealTimeGet.testStressRecovery(): See also SOLR-3461 for more discussion\n\n\n\nI annotate the tests with an assume disabling Windows until this is fixed.",
