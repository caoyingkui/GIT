But if have the boost, highlighting doesn't works, but the moment i remove the boost highlighting start working again.\n\nBelow is the request i am sending.\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=%2B_query_%3A%22\n{!type%3Dedismax+qf%3D%27body^1.0+title^10.0%27+pf%3D%27body^2%27+ps%3D36+pf2%3D%27body^2%27+pf3%3D%27body^2%27+v%3D%27apple%27+mm%3D100}%22&group=true&group.field=content_group_id_k&group.ngroups=true&group.limit=3&fl=id%2Clanguage_k%2Clast_modified_date_dt%2Ctitle&rows=20&hl.snippets=1&hl.fragsize=200&hl.fl=body&hl.fl=title&hl=true&hl.q=%2B_query_%3A%22{!type%3Dedismax+qf%3D%27body^1.0+title^10.0%27+pf%3D%27body^2%27+ps%3D36+pf2%3D%27body^2%27+pf3%3D%27body^2%27+v%3D%27apple%27+mm%3D100}\n\n%22&debugQuery=true&wt=json&indent=true&hl.snippets=1&hl.fragsize=200&hl.fl=body&hl.fl=title&hl=true&boost=boost_weight\n\nOR\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=%2B_query_%3A%22\n{!type%3Dedismax+qf%3D%27body^1.0+title^10.0%27+pf%3D%27body^2%27+ps%3D36+pf2%3D%27body^2%27+pf3%3D%27body^2%27+v%3D%27apple%27+mm%3D100}\n\n%22&group=true&group.field=content_group_id_k&group.ngroups=true&group.limit=3&fl=id%2Clanguage_k%2Clast_modified_date_dt%2Ctitle&rows=20&hl.snippets=1&hl.fragsize=200&hl.fl=body&hl.fl=title&hl=true&debugQuery=true&wt=json&indent=true&hl.snippets=1&hl.fragsize=200&hl.fl=body&hl.fl=title&hl=true&boost=boost_weight\n\nBut if i do above two without the boost or use bf(additive) instead of boost(multiplicative), things works but i don't get the boost(multiplicative).\n\nI am using SOLR4.1.0\n\nAny help in this is really appreciated.\n\nRegards,\nLukes",
