            "content": "The solr.data.dir technique should be supported by the multicore.xml as well.  Maybe it is a misunderstanding of how -Dsolr.data.dir works?    It works by having a ${solr.data.dir} or ${solr.data.dir:<default value>} spelled out in any of the config files, even schema.xml.   So I believe it should work to be able to craft a multicore.xml as follows:\n\n<multicore adminPath=\"/admin/multicore\" persistent=\"true\" >\n  <core name=\"core0\" instanceDir=\"${root.dir}/core0\" />\n  <core name=\"core1\" instanceDir=\"${root.dir}/core1\" />\n</multicore>\n\nAnd launch with -Droot.dir=whatever\n\nCould you confirm whether that works for you?   Of course the value of the <dataDir> in each of your core's solrconfig.xml is taken into consideration also.\n\n[I've not confirmed what I'm typing here, just tossing out how I think it currently works - please confirm] "

Then I could write something like:\n\n   <dataDir>${solr.data.dir:./solr/data}/${solr.corename}</dataDir>\n\nand have the same line in each solrconfig instead of having to customize each one.\n\n "
