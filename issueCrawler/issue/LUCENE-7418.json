    "description": "We have three modules with (temporary) dependency on backwards codecs:\n\n\tjoin/\n\tqueryparser/\n\tspatial-extras/\n\n\n\nthis patch handles the first two, as they are easy. spatial-extras is more complex as its legacy support is not clearly separated, so i'm not trying to address that here.\n\nFor join/ we just remove deprecations. For queryparser/, same thing, except since solr exposes the xml queryparser, i moved the LegacyRangeQueryBuilder to solr and hooked it into its subclass of the parser.",
