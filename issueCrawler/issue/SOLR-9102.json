    "description": "It would be useful to add get() and put() Streaming Expressions that allows SolrCloud to be behave like a transactional distributed key/value store. This will allow Solr's real-time get and multi-get capabilities to be easily combined with other expressions.\n\nSample get syntax:\n\n\nget(collection, ids=\"a,b,c\")\n\n\n\nThis ticket will also explore the possibility of adding a transactional put. Different transaction schemes will be explored.\n\nput(collection, id=\"a\", fieldA=\"aaab\", fieldC=\"blah blah\")",
