    "description": "Currently the query is generated : \norg.apache.lucene.queries.mlt.MoreLikeThis#retrieveTerms(int)\n1) we extract the terms from the interesting fields, adding them to a map :\nMap<String, Int> termFreqMap = new HashMap<>();\n( we lose the relation field-> term, we don't know anymore where the term was coming ! )\n\norg.apache.lucene.queries.mlt.MoreLikeThis#createQueue\n2) we build the queue that will contain the query terms, at this point we connect again there terms to some field, but :\n...\n// go through all the fields and find the largest document frequency\nString topField = fieldNames[0];\nint docFreq = 0;\nfor (String fieldName : fieldNames) {\n  int freq = ir.docFreq(new Term(fieldName, word));\n  topField = (freq > docFreq) ? fieldName : topField;\n  docFreq = (freq > docFreq) ? freq : docFreq;\n}\n...\n\nWe identify the topField as the field with the highest document frequency for the term t .\nThen we build the termQuery :\n\nqueue.add(new ScoreTerm(word, topField, score, idf, docFreq, tf));\n\nIn this way we lose a lot of precision.\nNot sure why we do that.\nI would prefer to keep the relation between terms and fields.\nThe MLT query can improve a lot the quality.\nIf i run the MLT on 2 fields : weSell and weDontSell for example.\nIt is likely I want to find documents with similar terms in the weSell and similar terms in the weDontSell, without mixing up the things and loosing the semantic of the terms.",
