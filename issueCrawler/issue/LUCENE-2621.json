Currently a codec offer a FieldsConsumer which is pulled by the IndexWriter upon a flush request. Codecs are assigned per field and segment via the CodecProvider. So each field can have its own codec and each codec can have a different implementation. Yet, currently we only provide codec support for the reverse index so a codec can customize the term dictionary (TermsEnum would be the API counterpart) and posting lists (DocsEnum / DocsAndPositionsEnum in the API). What this issue tries to do is to open up this API as a general low level customization layer that enables users to also customize how Stored Fields and TermVectors are stored on disk.\n\nTerm vectors refer to org.apache.lucene.index.TermFreqVector, and it is processed by TermVectorsWriter now, correct?\nyes thats true.\n\nBut what are the stored fields? I cannot find them immediately.\nthere should be a StoredFieldsWriter and a FieldsReader.\n\nBTW, is there any design document of Lucene in the Wiki?\n\nnothing that I would call a design document. there are some pages which could be similar to what you are looking for but those might be out of date. You should maybe look int the corresponding issues to find design decisions. ",

            "content": "CodecProvider -> Codec and Codec -> FieldCodec makes sense to me. This way the Codec would be responsible for all global index parts (seginfos, fieldinfos), and it would provide API to manage per-field data (FieldCodec), stored fields (FieldsWriter/Reader, perhaps a class to tie these two together), and term vectors (TermVectorsWriter/Reader, again grouped in a class).\n\nRe. current patch: this looks like a great start. I discovered a problem lurking in SegmentMerger.mergeFields. setMatchingSegmentReaders checks only fieldInfos for compatibility, but it doesn't check the codecs (and fieldWriter/fieldReader) compatibility. It's happy then to use the matchingSegmentReader directly, which results in raw documents encoded with one codec being sent as a raw stream to a fieldWriter from another codec.\n\nAlso, SegmentInfo.files() is messy, it should be populated from codecs - as soon as I changed the extension of the stored fields file things exploded because TieredMergePolicy couldn't find the .fdx file reported by files().

            "content": "yeah another alternative name to FieldCodec would be something like PostingsFormat (or similar).\n\nBecause there is a big difference between PreFlex (which is actually a codec), and Memory/Pulsing.\n\nas far as the current patch: yeah its missing a lot... because as soon as I started digging here I thought, well we have to probably try to fix these codec classes first before going further. Really I would like for some of the stuff like shared docstores to be private to PreFlex codec, part of fixing the files() issue.\n\nSame with the merging, this bulk copying of index inputs should be in codec as well. Currently its not only wrong as you noted, but makes assumptions about the implementation. But i didn't want to just shove this into CodecProvider since it doesnt really belong there.\n\nFinally, I do think the CodecProvider has a place after we fix these names. But I dont think it should be really any more than name -> Codec resolution... currently it does too much. But to fix this, we really want to remove all the special per-field map, etc stuff it has... and this means factoring PerFieldCodecWrapper back out into codecs (in my opinion this should be PerFieldPostingsFormat, and just an 'ordinary' Codec). And for that to work correctly, we need FieldInfos reading/writing under codec control so that this per-field stuff can be private to PerFieldPostingsFormat....\n\nSo there is a ton to do, although I made a branch I'm kinda concerned about doing a bunch of renaming and keeping things in sync... maybe I should ignore this though. But for now I've been trying to figure out any way we can do this in individual incremental steps/issues directly on trunk, its always nice to make progress that way. ",
