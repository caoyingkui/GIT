I changed PulsingCodec to:\n\n\n\tNot use absurd RAM when cloning TermState\n\n\n\n\n\tDon't decode the byte[] entry in the terms dict until docs/positions enum is needed\n\n\n\n\n\tUse total TF (number of term positions across all docs) as the\n    threshold for storing in terms dict vs wrapped codec\n\n\n\nThis fixes the intermittent failure in\nTestIndexWriterOnJRECrash.testNRTThreads that we've seen lately.
