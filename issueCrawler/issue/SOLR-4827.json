    "description": "I am periodically import/index records into solr server.\n\n(1) so, suppose first, import 400000 records, commited.\n    and then do fuzzy search on it, and works fine.\n\n(2) import another 100000 records, commited. fuzzy search works fine.\n\n(3) import another 50000 records, commited. now, when i do fuzzy search on    not these new records but above older records; it gives me lesser records then previous.\n\nsay after 1st import it gives me 3000 records (from 400000) for any fuzzy search, now on same data it returns only 1000 records  (from 400000) for same search.\n\nabove steps are just example, its not like after 3rd import only it cause this issue.\n\nnot sure, if size of index cause any problem or any other issue.",
