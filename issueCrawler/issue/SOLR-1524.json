    "description": "Hi,all.\n    some days ago,I put a question  that \"why it gets slower while keep on increasing the start value accross distributed search ?\".\n    And one reply by Shalin Shekhar Mangar was \"distributed  search fetches start+rows documents from each shard in order to correctly merge the results\".\n    After this I read the source code,and I found  query across distributed search would  be separated into nshards' query.\nEach shard query will be excute as follows:\n        1.get ids of matched documents into DocList        //take little time\n        2.get all documents by id which result in step 1.  //take little time\n        3.write all the documents found to binary string    \n        4.parse the binary string back to SolrDocumentList  // step 4 take almost all the time used\n From above,I propose :It is not necessary to execute step 3 and step 4 even step 2,the ids found is enough to merge results,isn't it?",
