    "description": "Firstly, what prompted this issue was me wanting to use a git solr mirror but finding that git's lack of empty-directory support made the \"example\" ant task fail. This task requires examples/work to be in place so that it can delete its contents. Fixing this was a simple matter of adding:\n\n<mkdir dir=\"${example}/work\" /><!-- in case not there -->\n\n\nRight before the delete task.\n\nBut then it occurred to me, why even have a \"work\" directory since Jetty will apparently use a temp directory instead. \u2013 try for yourself (stdout snippet):\n2011-06-11 00:51:26.177:INFO::Extract file:/SmileyDev/Search/lucene-solr/solr/example/webapps/solr.war to /var/folders/zo/zoQJvqc9E0076p0THiri+k+++TI/Tmp/Jetty_0_0_0_0_8983_solr.war_solr_k1kf17/webapp\n\nOn my Mac, this same directory was used for multiple runs, so somehow Jetty or the VM figures out how to reuse it.\n\nSince this \"example\" setup isn't a real installation \u2013 it's just for demonstration, arguably it should not contain what it doesn't need.  Likewise, perhaps the empty example/logs directory should be deleted. It's not used by default any way.",

I think a WAR file is enough to provide for a production setting, and it should be enough for any Java webapp.  I'm not aware of any serious bugs in servlet engines that would truly warrant recommendation against using them instead of the version of Jetty provided in /example/.  By serious, I mean two things: One is a bug requiring a patch, not simply a configuration modification that we can easily tell users to make when they go to production. Second, this bug must actually be a serious bug, not just technically be a bug. If it's some arcane encoding issue that is only going to actually trigger a real problem in some small fraction of cases, then I don't think that's serious \u2013 I think instead we simply tell users about it and let them take whatever action they choose (e.g. choose another servlet engine if it matters to them, or do nothing if they are not impacted). For the ease of operational administration (especially for those with no Java expertise), going with a Linux RPM (or similar package system) or Windows Tomcat install with Service registry startup/shutdown hooks, is a lot better.\n\nIf I'm in the minority and those in power want to actually condone the \"/example/\" setup as a production ready installation, then I think this directory should be renamed to something like \"/server/\", and further instructions should be provided on starting it and stopping it with the operating system for at least Linux.

It's not that I don't care at all (although admittedly it's low priority for me); the point is more that a unicode bug in one servlet engine (Jetty) shouldn't mean we can't recommend people use the WAR file and deploy it to a servlet engine \u2013 generally speaking. Is Tomcat configured correctly a problem?  Resin?  \n\nUwe, you are apparently a fan of Jetty and that's great.  I sincerely think it's a great servlet engine.  There will always be people who will overcome the lack of certain conveniences (e.g. out of the box OS startup/shutdown hooks) to use their preferred software, whatever it may be for whatever reason. \"configuring it right\" IMO is where READMEs come in. A dedicated README for configuring specific servlet engines, should come with Solr (Yes I do know the info is in our Wiki).  Uwe, I think you are far outnumbered by the people who would prefer operational familiarity & setup convenience.\n\nI agree users should avoid deploying multiple apps in the same JVM \u2013 and just because you might want to use an Ubuntu OS level package does not imply that you will do that.  Heck, I could deploy an app to /example/webapps/ if I wanted to.\n\nAny way, I'm 0 for 3 and I'll shut up now.

Resin?\n\nWell, I would have a tough time recommending any of these servlet engines, not for any technical reason, but just because we test with jetty in hudson, etc and deal with the issues that come up. I'm sure in some special circumstances these alternative containers might have some value that actually justifies \"throwing away all the testing\" we do here with Jetty... but still thats a risk.\n\nYonik's link (SOLR-2158) is a good example, even if you were to change all the tests to work with alternative servlet container X and run 'ant test', this doesn't mean a whole lot. That particular bug was really difficult (impossible?) to reproduce and the reason we hit it is continual testing.\n\nBottom line I think, is if someone wants to ensure that Solr works well on Tomcat for example, then they should make a patch so that our tests test with this container too (e.g. in hudson, etc). Once its baked in hudson for a while, then I would say its easy for us to recommend it, too.\n\nBut in general, you won't hear me say \"its just a war file, therefore it works with all containers\". Just like you won't hear me say \"lucene is just a jar file, it works with all JREs\": I do run the lucene tests manually occasionally with BEA, IBM, etc but this is only sporatically, nothing like running with these every 30 minutes and knocking out bugs.

To start up Tomcat, you have to provide final configuration files in the default folder layout and start a main() static method from a class. Something so easy like jettyServer.addServletFilter() & similar things are not possible with Tomcat out of the box. This makes Jetty (in my opinion) the best servlet container around. I sometimes also use it that way (embedded in my Java app). "

I think if if someone uncomments that part of jetty.xml, then they can very well make the logs directory.  What I'm after here is a little bit of simplification for new users. I certainly don't get any heartburn over these directories, but if someone new sees \"logs\" and never sees anything go there, they might think something is wrong. And removing it is one less directory.  I say this after updating my Solr book, walking the users through the directory layout in the 1st chapter.  No big deal, but simplification/clarity is good. "
