    "description": "CoreContainer creates ZkController which creates Overseer. Therefore during the init method, zkController.getCoreContainer can return null. This is trappy because if you aren't careful, it is easy to initialize internal attributes of overseer components to null values which throw a NPE in future. This is especially a problem for autoscaling components.\n\nIdeally the CoreContainer should be created fully and a separate init method should create other components such as ZkController.",
