    "description": "When you use the JSON faceting API and you want to use aggregate functions on date fields, you get numbers instead.\ne.g. \n\njson.facet= {\n\"test\": {\"type\": \"query\", \"q\": \"*:*\", \"facet\": {\"first\": \"min(date)\", \"last\": \"max(date)\"}}\n}\nWhere date has a date type, you'll get\n{\"count\":15, \"first\":1.361525185E12, \"last\":1.387552939E12}\nIt'd be nice to get the results in a standard TZ format.\n\nSomeone already described this issue here:\nhttp://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/min-max-on-date-fields-using-JSON-facets-td4288736.html\nBut I haven't found any JIRA ticket linked to this problem.",
