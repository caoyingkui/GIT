            "content": "Patch.\n\nThe biggest change is that QueryRequest.process() wasn't declared as throwing IOException, unlike all the other request types, and was re-packaging them as SolrExceptions.  I think this is a bug, and it should - you should get a SolrServerException if there's an error on the server, and an IOException if there's a communication error.\n\nThis is a backwards-breaking change, but I think it's an important one to make - swallowing IOExceptions is just wrong here, and none of the other request types do it.
