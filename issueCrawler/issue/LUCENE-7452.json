    "description": "when parent filter intersects with child query the exception exposes internal details: docnum and scorer class. I propose an exception message to suggest to execute a query intersecting them both. There is an opinion to add this  suggestion in addition to existing details. \nMy main concern against is, when index is constantly updated even SOLR-9582 allows to search for docnum it would be like catching the wind, also think about cloud case. But, user advised with executing query intersection can catch problem documents even if they occurs sporadically.",
