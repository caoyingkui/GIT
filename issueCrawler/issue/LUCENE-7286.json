    "description": "Short description:\n\nIn WeightedSpanTermExtractor.extract(...)  method there is a long list of supported Queries. There is no SynonymQuery which leads to extractUnknownQuery() that does nothing. It would be really nice to have SynonymQuery covered as well.\n\nLong description:\n\nI'm trying to highlight an external text using a Highlighter. The query is created by QueryParser. If the created query is simple it works like a charm. The problem is when parsed query contains SynonymQuery \u2013 it happens, when stemmer returns multiple stems, which is not uncommon for Polish language. \n\nBtw. this is my first jira issue.",
