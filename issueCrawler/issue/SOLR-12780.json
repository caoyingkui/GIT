            "content": "Thanks Kamuela Lau for opening this ticket with a patch to add two additional activation functions!\n\nJust attached slightly revised patch, the main difference is the (proposed) use of Math.tanh instead of the \n\n(Math.exp(in) - Math.exp(-in))/(Math.exp(in) + Math.exp(-in))\n\n\nformula - what do you think? Initially I'd wondered about the benefits or otherwise of reducing the number of Math.exp calls and then your SOLR-12785 patch made me wonder if Apache Commons Math has activation functions and that then led to the discovery that Math.tanh exists in Java itself!

            "content": "Thanks Christine Poerschke for the comment and updated patch!\nI had no idea that Math.tanh exists in Java itself; intriguing indeed!\n\nI think that you are right; there are fewer Math.exp calls, and the use of Math.tanh is also more succinct and easier to understand. ",
