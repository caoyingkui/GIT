    "description": "SOLR-3829 tracks a bug a user unconvered with the \"LogWatcher\" functionality of the UI if/when there was a wildcard \"*\" dynamicField \u2013 the underlying crux of the problem being that the LogWatcher returns log data to the lcient as if each log message was a SolrDocument, and the QueryResponseWriter processes those SolrDocuments according to the rules of the schema (ie: multivalued=\"true\", etc...)\n\nsteffkes worked arround this specific problem in SOLR-3829 by using the first value of multiple values \u2013 but this really just helps the semi-common case of people with an \"ignored\" or \"string\" multivalued catchall dynamicField \u2013 the underlying problem is still a risk if any of the field names in these log messages happen to match field names in the schema using incompatible types (ie: fields that are declared numeric but the LogWatcher uses string data)\n\nwe need to change the LogWatcher to return these log messages using simple Map<String,String> or NamedList<String,String> data instead of fake SolrDocument objects",
