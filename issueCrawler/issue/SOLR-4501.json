    "description": "Probably there is a bug on line 144 of MoreLikeThisComponent.java method process()\n\nThere is a call:\n\nNamedList<DocList> sim = getMoreLikeThese(rb, rb.req.getSearcher(), rb.getResults().docList, mltcount);\n\n\nThe last argument (mltcount) is the number of similar documents to return for each result. However the signature of called method getMoreLikeThese is:\n\n\nNamedList<DocList> getMoreLikeThese(ResponseBuilder rb,SolrIndexSearcher searcher, DocList docs, int flags) \n\n\n\nThe last argument is the flags - which should contains values like SolrIndexSearcher.GET_SCORES and etc.\n\nPlease, could some developers confirm if this is a bug?",
