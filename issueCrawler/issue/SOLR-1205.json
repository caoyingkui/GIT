Is \"from_name1\" the name from the query and the \"to_name1\" the name of an underlying field in the index? If so, i would need:-\n\n\nfl.alias=title:placename&fl.alias=title:subject\n\n\n\n\nOne of the fields that caused particular bother when searching across shards was that the unique ID field had to be common to all shards. Would this help here? "
