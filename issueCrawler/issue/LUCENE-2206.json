    "description": "The snowball project creates stopword lists as well as stemmers, example: http://svn.tartarus.org/snowball/trunk/website/algorithms/english/stop.txt?view=markup\n\nThis patch includes the following:\n\n\tsnowball stopword lists for 13 languages in contrib/snowball/resources\n\tall stoplists are unmodified, only added license header and converted each one from whatever encoding it was in to UTF-8\n\tadded getSnowballWordSet  to WordListLoader, this is because the format of these files is very different, for example it supports multiple words per line and embedded comments.\n\n\n\nI did not add any changes to SnowballAnalyzer to actually automatically use these lists yet, i would like us to discuss this in a future issue proposing integrating snowball with contrib/analyzers.",

With this patch it now behaves equal to bw checkouts:\n\n\n\tIf you have no svn.exe available, it will ignore the checkout. If this is so, the test should pass, so I added an exit condition, if the data dir is not available.\n\tIf you have a svn.exe available, but the checkout fails, there is an network error or something else. The data dir now exists but the build should stop in this case.\n\n ",
