    "description": "I want to be able to run one benchmark that tests things using term vectors and not using term vectors.\n\nCurrently this is not easy because you cannot specify term vectors per round.\n\nWhile you do have to create a new index per round, this automation is preferable to me in comparison to running two separate tests.\n\nIf it doesn't affect anything else, it would be great to have setConfig(Config config) called in BasicDocMaker.resetInputs(). This would keep the term vector options up to date per round if you reset.\n\n\n\tMark",

That is unless I apply the above patch. This means that I cannot seem to set tokenizing, storing, or termvectors per round.\n\nFrom what I can tell it is because setConfig is only called once, and so only the first value is every read for those properties. The patch above puts set config in the resetInputs method which does get called per round. Not sure if that is the best fix, but I know cannot currently set those per round and have anything but the first setting take effect.\n\n\n\tMark\n\n ",

Thats how I noticed this to begin with...I was looking at the index and saw the term vector files on every round. Its possible I have something messed up, but every time I run through everything again and it really does not seem to be working.

The get property for everything in setConfig is only called once...that loads up the \"false:true\", returns false, and sets up \"true\" to be returned on the next call...the next time you call get on Config you will get the \"true\"...but there is no next time. Its only done once...so it shows up right in the output \"Round 0->1:   doc.term.vector:false->true\", but its only every called once and so only loads false.\n\n\n\tMark\n\n\n\n\n\nram.flush.mb=flush:32:32\ncompound=false\n\nanalyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer\ndirectory=FSDirectory\n\ndoc.stored=true\ndoc.tokenized=tok:false:true\ndoc.term.vector=vec:true:false\ndoc.term.vector.offsets=tvo:false:true\ndoc.term.vector.positions=tvp:false:true\ndoc.add.log.step=2000\n\ndocs.dir=reuters-out\n\ndoc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.ReutersDocMaker\n\nquery.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.ReutersQueryMaker\n\n# task at this depth or less would print when they start\ntask.max.depth.log=2\n\nlog.queries=true\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n{ \"Rounds\"\n      \n    ResetSystemErase\n\n        CreateIndex\n        { \"MAddDocs\" AddDoc(60) } : 20000\n        Optimize\n        CloseIndex\n  \n    OpenReader\n      { \"SrchTrvRetNewRdr\" SearchTravRet(10) > : 1000\n    CloseReader\n    OpenReader\n      { \"SearchHlgtSameRdr\" SearchTravRetHighlight(size[20],highlight[20],mergeContiguous[true],maxFrags[0],fields[body]) > : 1000\n\n    CloseReader\n\n    RepSumByPref SearchHlgtSameRdr\n\n    NewRound\n\n} : 2\n\nRepSumByNameRound\nRepSumByName\nRepSumByPrefRound MAddDocs\n\n ",
