    "description": "IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader...) internally uses SegmentMerger to add data from input index readers. However, SegmentMerger uses the new post-flex API to do this, which bypasses the pre-flex TermEnum/TermPositions API that FilterIndexReader implements. As a result, filtering is not applied.",

But, we are going to remove the pre-flex APIs (and make the flex APIs abstract) soonish, at which point all FilterIndexReader impls for trunk will have to cutover to flex.\n\nI'll commit shortly. ",
