    "description": "I have no idea how no one ran into this so far, but I tried to execute an .alg file which used ReutersContentSource and referenced both docs.dir and work.dir as Windows absolute pathnames (e.g. d:\\something). Surprisingly, the run reported an error of missing content under benchmark\\work\\something.\n\nI've traced the problem back to Config, where get(String, String) includes the following code:\n\n    if (sval.indexOf(\":\") < 0) {\n      return sval;\n    }\n    // first time this prop is extracted by round\n    int k = sval.indexOf(\":\");\n    String colName = sval.substring(0, k);\n    sval = sval.substring(k + 1);\n    ...\n\n\n\nIt detects \":\" in the value and so it thinks it's a per-round property, thus stripping \"d:\" from the value ... fix is very simple:\n\n    if (sval.indexOf(\":\") < 0) {\n      return sval;\n    } else if (sval.indexOf(\":\\\\\") >= 0) {\n      // this previously messed up absolute path names on Windows. Assuming\n      // there is no real value that starts with \\\\\n      return sval;\n    }\n    // first time this prop is extracted by round\n    int k = sval.indexOf(\":\");\n    String colName = sval.substring(0, k);\n    sval = sval.substring(k + 1);\n\n\n\nI'll post a patch w/ the above fix + test shortly.",

If I run the tests in eclipse they pass. So I'm guessing it's a problem w/ my env. or build.xml?\n\nI also tried 'ant clean test' from within benchmark, but it didn't help. I then tried 'ant clean' from root, and 'ant test' from benchmark, but the test just keeps waiting on WriteLineDocTaskTest, on this line:\n    [junit] ------------> config properties:\n    [junit] directory = RAMDirectory\n    [junit] doc.maker = org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks.WriteLineDocTaskTest$JustDateDocMaker\n    [junit] line.file.out = D:\\dev\\lucene\\lucene-trunk\\build\\contrib\\benchmark\\test\\W\\one-line\n    [junit] -------------------------------\n\nI think this can go in (if it passes on someone else's machine, while I figure out what's wrong in my env. separately.

Please have a look there at a patch I've posted which forces benchmark tests to run in sequential mode. Additionally, you can 'ant test -Drunsequential=1' from the command line, benchmark's root folder, to achieve the same.\nAnd it'd be great if you post the above on LUCENE-1709 as well \u2013 because now I know I'm not the only one running into this .
