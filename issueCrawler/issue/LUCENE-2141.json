    "description": "Once flex has landed and LUCENE-1990 is done, we should improve the RAM efficiency of String and StringIndex.\n\nThe text data can be stored in native UTF8 (saves decode when loading), and as byte[] blocks (saves GC load and high RAM overhead of individual strings).\n\nAnd with packed unsigned ints we can save alot for cases that don't have that many unique string values.",
