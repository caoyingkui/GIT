    "description": "BooleanScorer2, derived from scorer, has two inner classes both derived, ultimately, from Scorer.\nAs such they all define doc() or inherit it.\necj produces an error when doc() is called from score in the inner classes in the methods\n        countingDisjunctionSumScorer\n    and\n        countingConjunctionSumScorer\n\nThe error message is:\n    The method doc is defined in an inherited type and in an enclosing scope.\n\nThe affected lines are: 160, 161, 178, and 179\n\n\nI have run the junit test TestBoolean2 (as well as all the others) with\n        doc()\n    changed to\n        BooleanScorer2.this.doc()\n    and also to:\n        this.doc();\nThe result was that the tests passed for both.\n\nI added debug statements to all the doc methods and the score methods in the affected classes, but I could not determine what it should be.",
