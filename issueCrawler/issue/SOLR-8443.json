    "description": "When passing in a Streaming Expression to the /stream handler you currently use the \"stream\" http parameter. This dates back to when serialized TupleStream objects were passed in. Now that the /stream handler only accepts Streaming Expressions it makes sense to rename this parameter to \"expr\". \n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/collection1/stream?expr=search(...)",
