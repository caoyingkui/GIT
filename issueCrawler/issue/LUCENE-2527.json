    "description": "When we cutover FieldCache to use shared byte[] blocks, we added the boolean fasterButMoreRAM option, so you could tradeoff time/space.\n\nIt defaults to true.\n\nThe thinking is that an expert user, who wants to use false, could pre-populate FieldCache by loading the field with false, and then later when sorting on that field it'd use that same entry.\n\nBut there's a bug \u2013 when sorting, it then loads a 2nd entry with \"true\".  This is because the Entry.custom in FieldCache participates in equals/hashCode.",

            "content": "Yes, LUCENE-2649 puts fasterButMoreRAM= true or false in the same entry.  Whatever is called first is what gets used (without warning)\n\nOne option is to 'upgrade' the cache value \u2013 but I'm not sure which one is the upgrade.  Perhaps the last one that you ask for?  If that is the case, would we need another option that says \"I would like it fasterButMoreRAM unless you already have it cached different\"\n\nI think documenting that the setting needs to be used consistently is good.  If we have an error stream, then this would be an appropriate place to log an error/warning. ",
