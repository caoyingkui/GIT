    "description": "Currently Streaming Expressions select shards using an internal ZooKeeper client. This ticket will allow stream sources to except a shards parameter so that non-SolrCloud deployments can set the shards manually.\n\nThe shards parameters will be added as http parameters in the following format:\n\ncollectionA.shards=url1,url1,...&collectionB.shards=url1,url2...\n\nThe /stream handler will then add the shards to the StreamContext so all stream sources can check to see if their collection has the shards set manually.",
