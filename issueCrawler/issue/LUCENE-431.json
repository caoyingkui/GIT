The latter would probably be simpler. \n\nEnd of quote. \n\nI made version (b) of RAMInputStream. \nUsing this RAMInputStream, TestTermVectorsReader failed as the only \nfailing test.",

            "content": "We should fix both, RAMInputStream and RAMOutputStream to subclass IndexInput and IndexOutput directly. That saves a lot of unnecessary array copies.\n\nI'm attaching a new patch that changes both classes. Unlike Paul's patch this one keeps the current buffer in a local variable (as Doug suggested). \n\nAll unit tests pass including TestTermVectorsReader. The reason why this test failes in Paul's patch is that RAMInputStream does not throw an IOException in case EOF is reached.\n\nI did some quick tests in which I used a RAMDirectory to build an index. With this patch the test runs 170 secs, the old version takes 236 secs, which is an improvement of about 28%.\n ",
