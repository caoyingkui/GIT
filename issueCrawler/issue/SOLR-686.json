            "content": "I guess because I don't see any use-case or reason for using NoLockFactory other than some kind of testing.\nIf an index is truly read-only then a real lock factory won't have any overhead.\nBut a real lock factory is a nice backup in the event that the configuration is incorrect and it becomes writable.  People may also mistakenly believe that using \"none\" is more efficient somehow on read-only indexes.\n\nSo since I'd never recommend using \"none\" in any scenario, it doesn't seem like it should even be listed as an option in the example schema.  One could make the case that \"none\" should be removed altogether, but I didn't go quite that far. "

If \"single\" is just as good, then i'm totally on board with you... and the SEVERE makes sense.\n\nwe should tweak the example config to mention \"single\" as the recommended option for read only indexes in that case.
