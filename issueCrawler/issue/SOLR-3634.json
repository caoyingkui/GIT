            "content": "quick patch with all the major functionality and some tests.\n\nlots of nocommits in here, basicly all falling into three categories:\n\n\n\trefactoring - the changes to CoreContainer are all complete and relatively trivial, but involved renaming create/reload to doCreate/doReload which are wrapped in new stub methods that call them in try blocks where the \"finally\" does all the real work.  This was just for convinience to keep the patch easy to read w/o a lot of re-indenting, and these methods should be refactored away before committing.\n\tmore tests - the key stuff is already covered in the patch, and i did manual testing with CoreAdminHandler, but i definitely want more tests before committing.\n\t\"Directory not closed\" - something about this test is causing MockDirWrapper to complain it's never closed -  buti don't think this is a bug in the new code or the test.  I suspect we have an existing bug where SolrCore initialization failures after the Directory has already been opened aren't closing the Directory \u2013 so we should get to hte bottom of that (probably in a new issue if i'm correct)\n\n "
