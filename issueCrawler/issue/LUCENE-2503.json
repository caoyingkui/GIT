    "description": "The snowball stemmers are very aggressive and it would be nice if there were lighter alternatives.\n\nSome applications may want to perform less aggressive stemming, for example:\nhttp://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/5d16391e21ca6faf/plural_only_stemmer\n\nGood, relevance tested algorithms exist and I think we should provide these alternatives.",
