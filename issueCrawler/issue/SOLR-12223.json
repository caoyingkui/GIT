Also, is that paragraph applicable to both uni-directional or bi-directional? Or just uni-directional? It's placement suggests it applies to both types. ",

We can safely remove the entire note, as BOOTSTRAP is an internal operation which doesn't require human intervention. We can keep this information abstracted from the users, or at least this is not the right spot where this information should be listed. ",
