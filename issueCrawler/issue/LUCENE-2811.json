    "description": "Today SegmentInfo doesn't know if it has vectors, which means its files() method must check if the files exist.\n\nThis leads to subtle bugs, because Si.files() caches the files but then we fail to invalidate that later when the term vectors files are created.\n\nIt also leads to sloppy code, eg TermVectorsReader \"gracefully\" handles being opened when the files do not exist.  I don't like that; it should only be opened if they exist.\n\nThis also fixes these intermittent failures we've been seeing:\n\n\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError: IndexFileDeleter doesn't know about file _1e.tvx\n       at org.apache.lucene.util.LuceneTestCase$LuceneTestCaseRunner.runChild(LuceneTestCase.java:979)\n       at org.apache.lucene.util.LuceneTestCase$LuceneTestCaseRunner.runChild(LuceneTestCase.java:917)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.filesExist(IndexWriter.java:3633)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.startCommit(IndexWriter.java:3699)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.prepareCommit(IndexWriter.java:2407)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.commitInternal(IndexWriter.java:2478)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.commit(IndexWriter.java:2460)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.commit(IndexWriter.java:2444)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.TestIndexWriterExceptions.testRandomExceptionsThreads(TestIndexWriterExceptions.java:213)",

Your patch is a good indicator that we need to push stuff into codecs and let codecs decide if a feature is present in a segment. BW code should be handled in PreFlexCodec and new stuff like hasVector should be something a codec holds or rather segmentCodecs encodes really. Accessing the filename extensions outside a codec seem to be very odd (I know TV and Stored fields are not yet exposed - just sayin) \n\nAlso all the CFS and Compound Doc Store stuff should be pushed to codecs.\n\nI looked at the patch and it looks good to me though except of the one System.out.println:\n\n\n    System.out.println(\"SI READ 2\");\n\n\n\nsimon ",
