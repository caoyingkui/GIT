    "description": "The Solr admin UI as of now does take Slice state into account.\nWe need to have that differentiated.\n\nThere are three states:\n\n\tThe default is \"active\"\n\t\"construction\" (used during shard splitting for new sub shards),\n\t'recovery' (state is changed from construction to recovery once split is complete and we are waiting for sub-shard replicas to recover from their respective leaders), and\n\t\"inactive\" - the parent shard is set to this state after split is complete\n\n\n\nA slice/shard which is \"inactive\" will not accept traffic (i.e. it will re-route traffic to sub shards) even though the nodes inside this shard show up as green.\n\nWe should show the \"inactive\" shards in a different color to highlight this behavior.",

It may help put things in perspective.\n\nAfter a shardsplit Collections API call completes, the parent shard goes inactive i.e. stops receiving any requests (documents/queries/...), however on the admin UI it still shows up as a green slice.\nIt should switch to a different color on the UI.
