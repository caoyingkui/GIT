    "description": "AnalyzingInfixSuggester should clear its index in build() before adding new documents from the input.  This would bring it in line with other Lookup implementations. Currently it appends any suggestions to those already in the index. Note the javadoc which says \"Builds up a new internal \n{@link Lookup}\n representation\".  Alternatively, it could expose a clear() method, but this wouldn't be called by the existing Solr logic.\n\nI've had to work around this limitation now by using reflection to get a\nhandle on AIS.writer to clear it before calling build().",
