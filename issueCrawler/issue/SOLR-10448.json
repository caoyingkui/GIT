    "description": "We have different type of features, and their nature is different :\nSolrFeature -> can be query dependent / query independent\nFieldValueFeature -> query independent\nValue Feature -> query level\nOriginalScoreFeature - > query dependent\n\nIntuition\nLet's see when the extracted value for a feature change :\n\nQuery independent ( document level features) -> indexing time, every commit may change the feature value and possibly invaldiate the cache entry\n\nquery dependent -> both request parameters and index can change the feature value\n\nquery level -> only request parameters can change the value, it is not affected by the index\n\nCaching\nlet's see the benefits of having 3 separate caches ( so the feature vector components will be separated) :\n\nQuery independent feature Cache -> simply changing the request parameters will not invalidate the cache entry, only a commit will cause the autowarming\n\nQuery Dependent Feature Cache -> this will behave like the current cache, so changing params you will cache a different feature vector\n\nQuery level Cache ->the index is not involved at all\n\nI have not yet investigated how caching internally works in the LTR plugin so i don't know how much effort would imply.",
