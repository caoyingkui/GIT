    "description": "If a search query has many adjacent asterisks (e.g. fo**************obar), I can get my webapp caught in a loop that does not seem to end in a reasonable amount of time and may in fact be infinite. For just a few asterisks the query eventually does return some results, but as I add more it takes a longer and longer amount of time. After about six or seven asterisks the query never seems to finish. Even if I abort the search, the thread handling the troublesome query continues running in the background and pinning a CPU.\n\nI found the problem in src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/WildcardTermEnum.java on Lucene 3.0.1 and it looks like 3.0.2 ought to be affected as well. I'm not sure about trunk, though. I have a patch that fixes the problem for me in 3.0.1.",

            "content": "I took a look at this, and the worst-case behavior in 3x etc is, in my opinion, definitely bug territory.\n\nwhen 3x's wildcardEquals() encounters a '*', it does this:\n\nfor (int i = string.length(); i >= s; --i)\n          {\n            if (wildcardEquals(pattern, p, string, i))\n            {\n              return true;\n            }\n          }\n\n\n\nThis is itself already inside a loop in wildcardEquals, so its a disaster.\n\nI added a test for this, and Nick's fix (with one needed length check) and the tests pass.\nbut if you run the test without the change, you will see what Nick is experiencing.
