    "description": "Kstem is an open-source stemmer similar to Porter. Many people, including myself believe it does a better job than Porter. It was written by Bob Krovetz at Umass, Amherst.  Sergio Guzman-Lara adapted it to work with Lucene. I wrapped that code into an extension to work with Solr. More info here:  http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/cgi-bin/downloads/downloads.cgi \n\nWe use it now in two implementations and are satisfied with it. A number of people have asked about it so it would probably make a good candidate for inclusion into the base. I sent Yonik the code sometime back but would be ahppy to provide that again. Let me know.: wagnerh@oclc.org",
