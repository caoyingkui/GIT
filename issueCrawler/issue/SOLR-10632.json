If another instance is started these logfiles are moved to archived, eventhough the other server is still running.\nSolution could be to give every logfile a name with the portnumber it belongs to. Or check if a logfile is still in use and quit with an error before moving to archived.",

I think this is a far better, and already supported, solution, segregating logs for each instance 100%.\n\nThis is also documented in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Taking+Solr+to+Production#TakingSolrtoProduction-Logsettings, and when you install Solr using install script, logs for each instance is automatically set relative to $SOLR_VAR_DIR.\n\nI can see that if someone is developing and starting several instances from the same installation folder without specifying SOLR_LOGS_DIR, then what you describe will be happening. We could of course default to sending logs to server/logs as today if port==8983, else change log dir to logs_<port>? ",

If a user installs only one copy of Solr, but chooses port 8080, why should the logs folder be /var/solr/logs_8080? I think the refGuide about \"Taking Solr to Production\" is quite clear on the SOLR_LOGS_DIR already, but feel free to suggest different wording to make it even better. ",

Then look for a $SOLR_LOGS_DIR/solr-$PORT-console.log file, do NOT rotate those logs, and either refuse to start or yell a big fat warning in the logs of the new instance that you're using same log directory as a running instance and give a hint about changing SOLR_LOGS_DIR?
