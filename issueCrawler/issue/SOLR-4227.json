    "description": "org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.StreamingUpdateSolrServer line 112 is:\n  OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(out, \"UTF-8\");\nand then we call\n  req.writeXML( writer ); \nBecause the writer is not buffered, this causes the XML writer to call the UTF-8 encoder for each atom being written, like in org.apache.solr.common.util.XML.writeXML:\n  out.write('<');\nThis causes the stream encoder to allocate a char array to hold it, and \nsun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder.implWrite allocates a CharBuffer to wrap it.  All just for one character.\n\nThis is particularly a problem when you have a lot of threads (100?) writing to the SOLR server, they rapidly eat up all the CPU.\n\nIt would be helpful to allocate the writer as a BufferedWriter, so encoding only happens when you flush.  JavaDoc for OutputStreamWriter recommends this: \"For top efficiency, consider wrapping an OutputStreamWriter within a BufferedWriter so as to avoid frequent converter invocations.\"",
