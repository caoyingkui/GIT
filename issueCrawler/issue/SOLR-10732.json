    "description": "spin off of SOLR-10727...\n\n\n...why not (also) optimize it slightly higher up and completely avoid the construction of the Query objects? (and in some cases: additional overhead)\n\nfor example: the first usage of SolrIndexSearcher.numDocs(Query,DocSet) i found was RangeFacetProcessor.rangeCount(DocSet subset,...) ... if the first line of that method was if (0 == subset.size()) return 0 then we'd not only optimize away the SolrIndexSearcher hit, but also fetching the SchemaField & building the range query (not to mention the much more expensive getGroupedFacetQueryCount in the grouping case)\n\nAt a glance, most other callers of SolrIndexSearcher.numDocs(Query,DocSet) could be trivially optimize this way as well \u2013 at a minimum to eliminate Query parsing/construction.",
