    "description": "The issue is to provide build/makefile support for a 3rd Java compiler. \n\nTo add a new directory named \"vjc\" under the \"src\" directory,  following the pattern of the \"gcj\" directory\nwhich provides build/makefile support for the GNU Java compiler.\n\nThe \"vjc\" folder would include a readme.txt file describing particular compiler and platform issues\nand specific build notes. It would also contain the \"solution\" and \"project\" files needed to build\nfrom the standard Java Lucene sources. Any platform-specific source code would also be contained\nin this folder. A platform-specific patch file is also contained here, which ideally would be automatically\napplied by the build process.\n\nWork along these lines so far is available at http://alum.mit.edu/www/gjc/lucene-java-vjc.html",
