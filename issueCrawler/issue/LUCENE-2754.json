    "description": "I set fix version: 4.0, but possibly we could do this for 3.x too\n\nCurrently, we have a special SpanRegexQuery in contrib, and issues like LUCENE-522 open for SpanFuzzyQuery.\nThe SpanRegexQuery in contrib is a little messy additionally.\n\nFor any arbitrary MultiTermQueries to work as a SpanQuery, there are only 3 requirements:\n\n\tThe un-rewritten query must extend SpanQuery so it can be included in Span clauses\n\tThe rewritten query should be SpanOrQuery instead of BooleanQuery\n\tThe rewritten term clauses should be SpanTermQueries.\n\n\n\nInstead of having logic like this for each query, i suggest adding two rewrite methods:\n\n\tScoringSpanBoolean rewrite\n\tTopTermsSpanBoolean rewrite\n\n\n\nas a start i wrote these up, and added a SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper that can be used to wrap any multitermquery this way.\nthere are a few kinks, but I think the MTQ policeman can probably help get through them.",

Phantastic \n\nAbout the nocommit and more problems related to this:\n\n\n\tI would remove separate boosts for wrapped and wrapper query. The wrapper should simply delegate get/setBoost(). We have other examples in Lucene that do the same (somewhere...). So the boost does not need to be set in rewrite() and toString() may not show two different boosts. toString() should not print any boost at all (only the wrapped query will do).\n\tThe same should be done in the rewrite method, it should simply delegate. In ctor, it could set the rewrite mode initially to a span default. We should only document this.\n\n\n\nWhen we respect both things, why do we need the wrapper at all? Wrapping and setting a rewrite mode is the same work. And the SpanRegExQuery in contrib could simply set the rewrite mode in the ctor (like Fuzzy or NRQ does) and maybe override toString() for nice output. ",
