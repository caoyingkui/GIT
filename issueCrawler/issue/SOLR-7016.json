After a few random fixes I was try to get Solr to run in standalone mode in a directory named 'Test Dir' i.e. with a space but I am not confident with what I did.\nI'll try working on it more but I think it'd be way more productive for someone else (who is happy working on and understands windows) to take it up.

I would like to maybe restore this in Solr trunk, too. I have no idea why this was only committed to build.xml in trunk.\n\nThanks, Uwe ",

So all you can really do is start the server, unless I'm missing something? The script can't run an example in the foreground since it needs to execute commands (create core and post docs) after the server starts. Why don't we just get rid of the run-example target as doing: ant server && bin\\solr -e techproducts is the same.\n\nNot sure about why that fix didn't get ported to the other branches ... most likely my fault.

I think perhaps going back to the jar way of starting is not such a bad idea. \n\nStarting with a collection is not a priority, making it easy to add one is, in which case I just want to start solr via ant in eclipse, and it doesn't need to auto create anything.

The run-example is a convenience target for developers to quickly start a new instance and see the log output inside the ANT log. Also you can kill with Ctrl-C when you are done. This target is not intended to be used by endusers.\n\nWhat we can do: We can use a <parallel> ant task to start a parallel task (parallel to the start.jar) execution, that creates and imports the techproducts example. I can help with that. Just give me the REST commands to send or a script to execute (synchronously) to setup the techproducts example on a running server. ",
