We should check to see if svnversion exists before attempting the command at all, if possible.\n\nThe message looks something like:\n [exec] Execute failed: java.io.IOException: java.io.IOException: svnversion: not found\n\nWhich is understandable, but it is not clear what the ramifications are of this missing.",
