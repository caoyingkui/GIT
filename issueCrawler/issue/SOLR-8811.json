    "description": "I've been trying to cut some tests over to use SolrCloudTestBase, and have found that DeleteInactiveReplicaTest won't work in non-legacy mode.  This is because the \"don't start up if you've been unregistered\" logic relies on a coreNodeName not being present, but if the collection has been created via the Collections API then coreNodeName is always set.",

            "content": "Here's a patch illustrating the problem.  DeleteReplicaTest.deleteDeadReplicaTest() fails, because the core doesn't notice that it has been unregistered and comes online when it's parent node comes back up.\n\nI'm not sure if this is actually fixable, but I'm also not sure that it should work in the first place in ZK-is-truth mode.  If a node hosting a replica is down, then I think it's reasonable to just return an error when trying to delete that node.\n ",
