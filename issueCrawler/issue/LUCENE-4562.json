    "description": "It would be useful to have an FST utility method to do a compare() operation between a key in one FST and a key in a second FST, by ords instead of the keys.  So the input is the ord for FST1 and an ord for FST2 and the output is -1, 0, 1.  The result is the same as if you were to do a Util.getByOutput for both ords against their respective FSTs then compare the resulting byte arrays.\n\nThe point of this is to speedup LUCENE-3729 further, which impact sorting across segments.  I would be surprised if it doesn't have applicability to other problems.",
