I restarted the Solr servers and they refuse to recover.\nI am not even able to delete the collections and create them afresh.\nIt seems the only way out is to do an rm -rf and re-install\n\nNote that it is not related to network as I can ssh to the Solr machines and send messages to other Solr machines using nc\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2:\nI had a 24 node cluster with 2 collections.\nEach collection used  6 nodes and had 2 shard, 3 replica configuration.\nSo 12 nodes used out of 24 nodes.\nRest 12 nodes had Solr running with same zookeeper but no collections/cores.\nAfter the above errors begin to happen, Solr-UI of all 24 nodes became unresponsive!\n\nSo I tried the delete-collection API from the command line - no response.\nUltimately I ran the delete-collection from the command line in a loop and it deleted a part of the collection.\nThen I had to manually delete the <coreName>/data/index/write.lock file on some nodes to purge those bad collections.\nIts been a few hours since then. There are no collections and still few nodes are unresponsive with following messages in the logs:\n\nINFO  - 2017-06-03 06:40:51.308; org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore; Core sync-status_shard1_replica2 is not yet closed, waiting 100 ms before checking again.\nINFO  - 2017-06-03 06:40:51.408; org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore; Core sync-status_shard1_replica2 is not yet closed, waiting 100 ms before checking again.\nINFO  - 2017-06-03 06:40:51.508; org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore; Core sync-status_shard1_replica2 is not yet closed, waiting 100 ms before checking again.\nINFO  - 2017-06-03 06:40:51.608; org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore; Core sync-status_shard1_replica2 is not yet closed, waiting 100 ms before checking again.\n\nIt looks like a serious stability problem to me.",

            "content": "This seems to be a very low level Lucene problem, possibly caused by building an index with one schema, then trying to change the schema and use it with an existing index.  You're indicating that this is happening during collection creation ... so I'm wondering if perhaps you have some existing core/index directories left over from a previous version of the collection, and Solr is trying to recreate a core with a directory that already exists and contains an index, and finding that the existing index isn't compatible with the new schema.\n\nGenerally speaking, most schema changes require a reindex, and sometimes the entire index must be completely wiped out before starting the reindex, because of problems like this.\n\nhttps://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToReindex\n\nLow-level Lucene problems are very difficult for Solr to handle cleanly.  You're right that this shouldn't cause everything to grind to a halt, but it may be challenging to achieve a reasonable outcome when there is a very low-level Lucene problem.  We should try, I'm just warning you in advance that it might not be easy. ",

We were using data-driven schema and our theory is that one of the shard guessed some field to be as long while the other shard guessed the same field to be as integer.\n\nIf that is true, then its a pretty bad problem IMO which is difficult to reproduce (because each shard should simultaneously guess the type of the same field to be different). Also this is a problem that may not show up in several test-runs but may show up directly in production because it depends on race conditions between the shards.\n\nAnd it still does not answer why the Solr UI is becoming unresponsive. Why is the thread running Solr UI getting blocked due to any low-level problems? ",
