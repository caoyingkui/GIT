For these uses, I've just moved the existing Token implementation into the test framework.\n\tin PrefixAwareTokenFilter and PrefixAndSuffixAwareTokenFilter.  These are a bit hacky, and could do with replacing with a proper ConcatenatingTokenFilter, but for now I've duplicated Token as a package-private class in analysis.miscellanous.\n\tIn the solr spellcheck API.  Here, I've copied Token into the solr.spelling package and undeprecated.\n\n ",
