    "description": "A spinoff from LUCENE-2294. Instead of asking the user to specify on IndexWriter his requested MFL limit, we can get rid of this setting entirely by providing an Analyzer which will wrap any other Analyzer and its TokenStream with a TokenFilter that keeps track of the number of tokens produced and stop when the limit has reached.\n\nThis will remove any count tracking in IW's indexing, which is done even if I specified UNLIMITED for MFL.\n\nLet's try to do it for 3.1.",

The cost of creating the filter is neglectible, as the filter has no initialization cost (it uses no attributes, does not create attribute maps,...)\n\toverride tokenStream that does the same, but instead delegates to inner analyzers tokenStream method.\n\tMake this analyzer final, else we need VirtualMethod (also the TokenFilter, of course)\n\tOverride the rest of the methods in Analyzer and simply delegate. Don't forget the posIncr Gap methods and so on!\n\n\n\nI will supply a patch with filter and analyzer later. ",

This could be fixed (if really needed, as the MaxFieldLength in IW should be deprecated) by moving the check up and dont even try to index the field and create the TokenStream.\n\nI just wanted to add this difference here for further discussing.

In this model, if you then appended the new LimitTokenCountFilter to the end, I think it'd result in the same behavior as maxFieldLength today.\n\nBut, even before we eventually switch to that model... can't we still deprecate (on 3x) IW's maxFieldLength (remove from trunk) now?  I realize the limiting is different (applying the limit pre vs post concatenation), but I think the javadocs can explain this difference?  I think it's unlikely apps are relying on this specific interaction of truncation and multi-valued fields... ",
