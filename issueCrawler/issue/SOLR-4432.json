On the other hand, make sure also that there are no documents in the example directory before making copies.\"",

Solr has a lot of those fiddly little things that more modern engines take care of automatically.\n\nAnd if we know we need it, then why not just do it automatically? "

            "content": "And if we know we need it, then why not just do it automatically?\n\nBecause the only way to do it automatically in a webapp world is to put it in the Solr dist unzipped already - meaning we either stop shipping the war file as well (which some people use), or we balloon the size of the dist.\n\nMaking people put in a one liner to unzip it before using the zkcli tool seemed preferable to me.\n\nI suppose you could make the argument that it's better we ship it exploded and force those using the war to zip it up into a war themselves. I'd be open to that. "

The only sane way I've ever managed a SolrCloud cluster is minimally using shell scripts and ssh. I write one script, and it runs on all the nodes.\n\nYou also don't need to extract the war on all 4 machines - just the machine you are going to run the zkcli script on - you need to access the class files to run it. The other nodes will auto extract the war when you start jetty/solr. "
