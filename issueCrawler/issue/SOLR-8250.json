Attaching patch to illustrate and describing in words here also.\n\n#1 OverseerElectionContext.runLeaderProcess has a local variable id that shadows the id member in the ElectionContext base class.\n\n#2 So i went and renamed id to coreNodeName (the ElectionContext constructor uses that as its argument name already and thus this.id = coreNodeName; becomes this.coreNodeName = coreNodeName;, so far, so good.\n\n#3 Next then i noticed that the ShardLeaderElectionContext.startLeaderInitiatedRecoveryOnReplicas local variable coreNodeName is now shadowing ElectionContext's coreNodeName member and that on the preceding line local variable shardId already shadows the shardId member in ShardLeaderElectionContextBase class.\n\n#4 So then to remove the shadowing i renamed the local variables giving cloudDescCollection (formerly coll), cloudDescShardId (formerly shardId) and cloudDescCoreNodeName (formerly coreNodeName) as the local variables with ShardLeaderElectionContextBase's members still being called collection and shardId plus the coreNodeName member from the ElectionContext base class.\n\n#5 This then highlights when the local variables are used and when the (now no longer shadowed) class members are used and we have a mix with\n\n-      String znodePath = zkController.getLeaderInitiatedRecoveryZnodePath(coll, shardId);\n+      String znodePath = zkController.getLeaderInitiatedRecoveryZnodePath(cloudDescCollection, cloudDescShardId);\n\n\nand\n\n-          final Replica.State lirState = zkController.getLeaderInitiatedRecoveryState(coll, shardId, replicaCoreNodeName);\n+          final Replica.State lirState = zkController.getLeaderInitiatedRecoveryState(cloudDescCollection, cloudDescShardId, replicaCoreNodeName);\n\n\nusing the local variables but\n\n             List<ZkCoreNodeProps> replicaProps =  \n-                zkController.getZkStateReader().getReplicaProps(collection, shardId, coreNodeName);\n+                zkController.getZkStateReader().getReplicaProps(collection, cloudDescShardId, cloudDescCoreNodeName);\n\n\nand\n\n        \n               zkController.ensureReplicaInLeaderInitiatedRecovery(cc,\n-                  collection, shardId, coreNodeProps, core.getCoreDescriptor(),\n+                  collection, cloudDescShardId, coreNodeProps, core.getCoreDescriptor(),\n                   false /* forcePublishState */);\n\n\nusing the collection member but the shard id and core node name local variables.",
