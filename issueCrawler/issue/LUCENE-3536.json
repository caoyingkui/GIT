In lucene/contrib/contrib-build.xml (included in most modules' build.xml files), it is defined as ../../dist/maven.  Modules that are only one level up from where dist/ should go, e.g. all non-analysis modules under modules/, have to define maven.dist.dir to be ../dist/maven before importing lucene/contrib/contrib-build.xml, so that the local property definition takes precedence.  This is not done in either modules/join/build.xml or modules/facet/build.xml. ",
