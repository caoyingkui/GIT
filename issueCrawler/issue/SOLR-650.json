This behaviour is inconcistent with the other parameters which accept field names as arguments \u2013 they allow specifying multiple field names either as a comma- or space-separated list or by specifying the parameter multiple times.",

Using field names with whitespace in them breaks almost everywhere else (retrieving fields, highlighting...) \u2013 I don't think that many people are using fields with whitespace in them at all. Obviously I can only speculate about this though, so do correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThe only way i'm going to be on board with something like this is if it's a customization via some sort of general field name aliasing/globing configuration mechanism...\n\nI think making the way parameters like this are handled consistent is a first step in that direction. It's going to be much easier to design and implement general field configuration parameters when they are handled in a uniform way.\n\nWouldn't your approach be inconsistent with the way multi-valued parameters are handled in HTTP?\n\nSort of, but so is the rest of Solr.\n\nI'd say put multiple parameters separated by comma only when order is important (e.g. sort).\n\n...which is also inconsistent with multi-valued parameter handling in HTTP \n\nI think it doesn't really matter that Solr is inconsistent with HTTP parameter handling as long as it's consistently inconsistent.
