While zookeeper is down, the log shows connection failures as expected.  When zookeeper comes back, the log shows:\n\nINFO  - 2013-08-09 15:48:41.528; org.apache.solr.common.cloud.ConnectionManager; Client->ZooKeeper status change trigger but we are already closed\n\nAt that point, Solr (admin UI and all other functions) does not work, and won't work until it is restarted.",
