If it is determined this is a bug, we can re-open this issue with the additional information you have gathered by that time. ",

If an escape is specified, the encapsulator is not used unless also explicitly specified since most formats use either encapsulation or escaping, not both\"\n\nSo just set escape to backslash and you should be good (that will disable encapsulation processing) ",
