            "content": "ShingleMatrixFilter is a very complicated filter. It seems that it is implemented in a very inefficient way, it does lots of cloning. While I was able to fully convert ShingleFilter in a way, so that it is now much more efficient now, I'm not going to do that with the ShingleMatrixFilter.\nI don't know the code well enough to even try and with 1000 LOC it's very complex.\n\nThe drawback of not fully converting it is that if someone uses custom Attributes, i. e. ones that are not in core Lucene, it is undefined what the filter will do with those Attributes. However, I don't even know what the behavior should be. If only core Attributes are used, everything is working fine, as the passing junits show.\n\nI added a corresponding comment to the javadocs of that class. ",

            "content": "This ShingleMatrixFilter is really a pain!\n\nI think the ShingeMatrix is very \"special\" and only produce tokens with few correlation to the original input stream, so it is not so bad, if the extra attributes get lost.\n\nYou could use a simple AttributeSource instead of EmptyTokenStream and create it with the same AttributeFactory as the filter isself. Because of this, you could copyTo the extra Tokens (currently implemented by the Token instance). This reuseableToken could also be an AttributeSource? For me it is not really clear what all this copying between the attributes and the Token instance does, but it seems that it could be converted to Attributes, too. If you do it that way, would it be not work also with custom attributes? One possibility would be to copyTo the Tokens around (or use States) and then modify the shingle speicfic things. ",
