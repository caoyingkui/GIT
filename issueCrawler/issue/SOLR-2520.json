    "description": "Please see http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset.\n\nIf a stored field contains Unicode characters that are valid in Json but not valid in Javascript, and you use the query option to ask for JSONP (json.wrf), solr does not escape them, resulting in content that explodes on contact with browsers. That is, there are certain Unicode characters that are valid JSON but invalid in Javascript source, and a JSONP response is javascript source, to be incorporated in an HTML script tag. Further investigation suggests that only one character is a problem here:  U+2029 must be represented as \\u2029 instead of left 'as-is'.",

This demands 'jsonp' instead of json, which results in the result being treated as javascript, not json.  wt=json&json.wrf=SOME_PREFIX will cause Solr to respond with\n\n     SOME_PREFIX(\n{whatever it was otherwise going to return})\n\ninstead of just\n\n     {whatever it was otherwise going to return}\n\nIf there is then an interesting Unicode character in there, Chrome implodes and firefox quietly rejects.\n "
