            "content": "Well, it's sad to see the stuff I came up with (and Mike implemented) go away...  But more seriously \u2013 this does seem to impact large automata. Can you recode the existing automata and see how much we lose by removing packing? Looking at the patch target addresses are still vint-encoded; if I recall right the compression ratio gained by packing was significant (compared to baseline fst), but a small fraction of overall input size. So a fst gain of a few megabytes for data size that is several hundred megabytes is indeed worth cutting the additional complexity of fst construction.\n\n+1 to remove it, but some stats on dictionary sizes before/after would be nice.

But I'd like to clean up PackedInts a bit, and FST packing is one user of this API. And I noticed there is nothing in the code base that enables packing on FSTs, except the kuromoji dictionaries, which are smaller with packing disabled than with packing enabled. "

Anyway, I don't think this is that crucial, really. \n\nexcept the kuromoji dictionaries, which are smaller with packing disabled than with packing enabled.\n\nThis should never happen, something is wrong. The way automata compression was implemented in Morfologik would nearly always decrease the size of the automaton, especially in the first few optimization/ reshuffling steps.
