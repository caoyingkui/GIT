In order to do so, I think we should rethink the page a bit, and perhaps have only a single text area and have check boxes to be able to multselect of those three (index, query, multiterm) current analysis chains.\n\n\n\n\n\tHighlighting index terms matching from the query text analysis... this is a very misleading/confusing thing to work with unless you really understand that this is purely analysis and no query parsing is involved.  Somehow we should integrate query parsing into a trouble-shooting / exploratory / introspection tool like this, perhaps separately from the analysis page, but maybe somehow optionally integrated such that a query text box is truly parsed.\n\n\n\nI'd really like to see a multiterm analysis view.

What I was envisioning was a series of checkboxes above the output that controls what is shown.  With the text of the token being the default, but other unchecked options for \"raw bytes\", \"positions\", \"offsets\", etc.  To do this with arbitrary attributes, the output would need to be processed to get the dynamic set of attributes represented.

            "content": "OK, I will make a comment or two... But understand that my UI design skills are legendary... legendarily bad.\n\n> Let's not default to verbose. That's real intimidating for someone seeing it for the first time.\n\n> Let's remove one of the entry fields. 99% of the time I really want to see the same input go through at least the index and query chains. I'd rather put different text in a single entry field on those rare occasions when I want different index and query terms analyzed than copy all the time.\n\n> I think it's extremely valuable to have side-by-side display. When someone just starting looks at, say, WDFF on a side-by-side screen, it gives them information that they'd never notice otherwise. If this is only in non-verbose mode, fine.\n\n> I think that having the sliders for long input when side-by-side is preferable to stacking anything vertically. Most of the time, I'm only worried about a few terms anyway and the usually fit side-by-side.\n\n> Putting on my newbie hat, it's not obvious that the really cool display of the class when you hover over the abbreviations for the tokenizers/filters is available. Perhaps a note somewhere \"hover over abbreviations to see the definition\"? What'd be really cool is to show the complete definition in the hover box (e.g. the catenateWords, catenateNumbers from WDFF). Don't quite know how to get it to the UI, but.. <G>....\n\n> I thought a bit about MultiTermAware stuff, and it's a sticky wicket for the same reasons it's always been one, this bypasses parsing. Can we cheat here? I have in mind some weird bit where we detect wildcards on input, and somehow send all the wildcard terms through the multiterm chain and put them back in the display in place of the wildcards that went through the whole chain. I like making Stefan work hard <G>... OK, maybe I can help. Perhaps we can colorize this switch with a note about it somehow to signal that \"something you may not have expected happened\".\n "

I think that what needs to happen is that the background color of the index section needs to be visually distinct from the background color of the query section, and both need to be different from the white UI background and the purple highlight background.  The same colors should be used as the backgrounds for the text input boxes.\n\nI'm OK with the query section dropping down below the index section when the index section is really wide.  I'd also be OK with it being to the right, but only if a visual indicator is displayed (other than the horizontal scrollbar itself) that makes it clear you have to scroll right to see more. "
