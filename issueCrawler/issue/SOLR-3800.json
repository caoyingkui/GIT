    "description": "Federated request support in SearchHandler could look similar to current DistributedSearch support: design based on STAGE flags and optional requests sending to collections (shards). The main difference would be in supported stages and in additional request available (request to collections representation module). Something like:\n\navailable stages:\n\n\tCOLLECTION SELECTION\n\tPREPARE MERGE RULES\n\tGET DOCUMENTS\n\n\n\navailable actions:\n\n\tsend search requests to shards (to adapters and solr instances)\n\tsend requests to indexes representation\n\n\n\ninvoked Component's methods:\n\n\tfederatedProcess()\n\thandleFederatedResponses()\n\thandleCollectionRepresentationResponses()\n\n\n\n\nAny suggestions welcome!",
