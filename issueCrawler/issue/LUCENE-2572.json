The artifacts are correctly produced (http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Lucene/job/Lucene-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/maven_artifacts/lucene/).\nHowever, the artifacts which should be stored under the path \"org/apache/lucene/\" are currently stored under \"lucene\" which prevents a project using maven to correctly download the Lucene 4.0 artifacts.\n\nThanks again for your help.",
