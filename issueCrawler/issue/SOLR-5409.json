    "description": "The core.properties file is renamed to core.properties.unloaded when a core is unloaded. However if the core is reloaded a new core.properties file is created. This can put a core in a state where it cannot be re-loaded without removing the core.properties file.\n\nSteps to reproduce using the web admin UI:\n\n\tCreate a core\n\tUnload the core\n\tCreate the core again\n\tUnload the core\n\tCreate the core again\n\n\n\nExpected Results:\nThe core should be created after the last step.\n\nObserved Results:\nThe last step fails because core.properties already exists and has not been renamed to core.properties.unloaded since that file already exists. This puts the core in a between state of being unloaded but unable to be re-loaded.",
