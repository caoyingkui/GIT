Are you sure that stacktrace is related to the hang?\n\nI agree w Erick...if you can submit the triggering file, that'd be best..\n\nWe're aware of one potential xml hang: TIKA-1401.\n\nUnfortunately, Tika will hang permanently.  I would be really surprised if this were a Solr problem.  Permanent hangs w Tika happens rarely, and we try to fix problems when they happen.  It is best to run Tika in a separate jvm either via tika-server, ForkParser, tika-batch or role your own hadoop-wrapper, or stay tuned for: SOLR-7632 ",

            "content": "1) Right.  That's the problem with how Tika is currently being used within DIH.  If it hangs, you'll never get an exception.  If the xlsx file is causing the hang and given the vintage of Tika you're using, it might be a custom fraction format (TIKA-1132)???\n\n2) ummm...the pdcidfont issue sounds like a pdf problem, not an Excel problem.  Does the excel file have an embedded PDF?  Will send email privately.\n\n3) I can't quite tell what behavior you'd like.  Please give more info.\n\nAs a side note, for debugging purposes, you might try grabbing the relevant version of tika-app, and dropping potential problem files into that. If it hangs, you've found your problem.\n\nAnother option is to run tika-app ( >= 1.8) in batch mode against an input directory.  If your logging is set up correctly, you'll be able to tell which file caused the hang.  The commandline for that is: java -jar tika-app-xx.jar -i <inputdir> -o <outputdir>, but see the tika-batch wiki for advanced usage on configuring logging.
