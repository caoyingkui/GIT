I see an import of the pooling client in there, but no other changes?\n\nDo you have something in mind? It seemed it was fairly well behaved - eg one poolingconectionmanager and one http client.\n\nI figure it should be a separate http client from update since you can do different timeouts.\n\nI'm certainly open to sharing the connection manager across both ...\n\nI just wanted to get jenkins take on these changes, but ready to do some iteration if you have some thoughts.
