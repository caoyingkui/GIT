            "content": "The test failures were occurring due to faulty shutdown behavior in the DaemonStream.\n\nThis patch makes the following changes:\n\n1) Removes the interrupt on shutdown. The interrupt was just faulty and causing the internal thread to exit during unsafe times. Now shutdown just flags the internal thread so that it will exit it's loop after completing a full run of the internal stream. \n\n2) Adds a shutdown method to the DaemonStream. When the DaemonStreams internal queue is enabled for continuous pull streaming, the contract for shutdown is:\n\n *a) call DaemonStream.shutdown(). This signals the internal thread to shutdown after it finishes it's run.\n  *b) call DaemonStream.read() until the EOF Tuple is read. This will clear the internal queue and unblock the internal stream if it's blocked on the queue.\n    *c) Call DaemonStream.close();\n\nIf the internal queue is not enabled, in the continuous push streaming use case, calling close()  will suffice.
