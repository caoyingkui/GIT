I think I have to disappoint you that the main point has not changed since ever. The main motivation is 0-dependency in Lucene core so I think we not gonna move forward on this issue. ",

As a user I'd get 80% of the benefit from having this available in Solr, which already depends on SLF4J, so maybe it would be better for me to resubmit this as a config option in Solr? lucene/misc also has no external deps at the moment.
