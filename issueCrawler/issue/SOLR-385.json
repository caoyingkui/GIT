In the best way there should be some coefficient to multiply Scores or some function.\nIs it possible to implement such a behavior for facet sort?",

For the 'ungeneralized version' - sorting against the maximum of the score (or any field?)- we can use the group-feature!\n\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/FieldCollapsing\n\nThe Solution - I think - would be the following request:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=hard&group=true&group.field=manu_exact&group.limit=1&debug=true&fl=*,score\n\nthe collapse groups are ordered by the maxScore I think + hope  \n\nSo it is the same as we want:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=hard&facet=true&facet.field=manu_exact&debug=true&fl=*,score&facet.stats.sort=max(score) desc\n\nNow one remaing task could be to extend this feature with max, min and mean functions ...\n\n\nhere is the 'group' result:\n\n\n<lst>\n<str name=\"groupValue\">Maxtor Corp.</str>\n\u2212\n<result name=\"doclist\" numFound=\"1\" start=\"0\" maxScore=\"0.70904505\">\n\u2212\n<doc>\n<float name=\"score\">0.70904505</float>\n\u2212\n<arr name=\"cat\">\n<str>electronics</str>\n<str>hard drive</str>\n</arr>\n\u2212\n<arr name=\"features\">\n<str>SATA 3.0Gb/s, NCQ</str>\n<str>8.5ms seek</str>\n<str>16MB cache</str>\n</arr>\n<str name=\"id\">6H500F0</str>\n<bool name=\"inStock\">true</bool>\n<str name=\"manu\">Maxtor Corp.</str>\n<date name=\"manufacturedate_dt\">2006-02-13T15:26:37Z</date>\n\u2212\n<str name=\"name\">\nMaxtor DiamondMax 11 - hard drive - 500 GB - SATA-300\n</str>\n<int name=\"popularity\">6</int>\n<float name=\"price\">350.0</float>\n<str name=\"store\">45.17614,-93.87341</str>\n</doc>\n</result>\n</lst>\n\u2212\n<lst>\n<str name=\"groupValue\">Samsung Electronics Co.
