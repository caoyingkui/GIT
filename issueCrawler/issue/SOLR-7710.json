    "description": "github pull request with proposed changes to follow shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\tMotivation is addition of a test case for an unrelated change (not yet uploaded) and not wishing to add literally \"async\" in that test case. Using CommonAdminParams.ASYNC instead of \"async\" can also make code base 'navigation' a little easier e.g. locating of existing test cases.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe proposed change also adds a little CommonAdminParamsTest to test the backwards compatibility of CommonAdminParams parameter constants i.e. if someone accidentally changes those constants then the test will flag that up.",
