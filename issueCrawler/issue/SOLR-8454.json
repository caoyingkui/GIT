The usage of LOG vs log is kind of split in the code base and I don't have a strong opinion on that so that's ok.\n\nI see you've capitalized log messages i.e. upper case starting char, at all places but here\n\nLOG.debug(\"server older than client {}<{}\", collection.getZNodeVersion(), version);\n\n\n\nThe rest all looks good to me to commit.

We should however explicit mention that in the ticket summary that we are not only improving the logging here but also cleaning up code.\n\nHere are the things that I have changed:\n\n\tRemoved unused import for ThreadFactory\n\tRemoved the unwanted path param from addSecuritynodeWatcher() method. The path is always SOLR_SECURITY_CONF_PATH and so it makes sense to just directly use it.\n\tIn addSecuritynodeWatcher.process() removed the following code as those conditions are never true. The code block doesn't throw KeeperException or InterruptedException:\n\nif (e instanceof KeeperException) throw (KeeperException) e;\nif (e instanceof InterruptedException) throw (InterruptedException) e;\n\n\n\tCapitalized the log line I mentioned in my last comment.\n\n ",
