    "description": "The JSONResponseWriter handles two purposes:\n\n\twriting JSON responses (wt=json)\n\twriting JSONP responses, namely JSON responses wrapped by a JavaScript function (wt=json&json.wrf=myFunction)\n\n\n\nThe response writer returns the same Content-Type in both cases. (default: application/json)\nBut for JSONP the correct Content-Type would be \"application/javascript\".\n\nThe response type is configurable, but it is currently not possible to return the correct Content-Type in both cases with one configuration at the same time.\n\nThe attached patch changes the default Content-Type to application/javascript; charset=utf-8 for responses with wrapper functions (JSONP). If param content-type is configured, this Content-Type will be returned for both JSON and JSONP to ensure backward compatibility.",
