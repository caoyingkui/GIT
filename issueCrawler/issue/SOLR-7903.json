    "description": "This ticket adds the FacetStream class to the Streaming API and wires it into the SQLHandler. The FacetStream will abstract the results from the JSON Facet API as a Stream of Tuples. This will provide an alternative to the RollupStream which uses Map/Reduce for aggregations.\n\nThis ticket will also wire the FacetStream into the SQL interface, allowing users to switch between the RollupStream (Map/Reduce) and the FacetStream (JSON Facet API) as the underlying engine for SQL Group By aggregates.  SQL clients can switch between Facets and Map Reduce with the new aggregationMode http param.",
