    "description": "See the discussion at the related SOLR-8131. The suggestion there is to make managed schema the default in 6.0. To make the new-user experience much smoother in that setup, it would be great if the admin UI had a simple wrapper around the managed schema API.\n\nIt would be a fine thing to have a way of bypassing the whole \"find the magic config set, edit it in your favorite editor, figure out how to upload it via zkcli then reload the collection\" current paradigm and instead be able to update the schema via the admin UI.\n\nThis should bypass the issues with uploading arbitrary XML to the server that shot down one of the other attempts to edit the schema from the admin UI.\n\nThis is mostly a marker. This could be a significant differentiator between the old and new admin UIs.",
