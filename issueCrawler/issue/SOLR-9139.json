    "description": "ReplicationHandler has volatile class member snapShootDetails.\nThe variable is not reset on new submission.\n\nUsecase:\nOn Core1 running a JVM1, submit a replication request. \nI poll this thread to check the replication status invoking the handler passing \"command=details\".\nIssue:\nI submit request1 on core1 to create replication. Poll the status using details. \nOnce the replication is complete, i submit the replication request2 on core1 again. When when we poll using handler for replication details, it still has request1 details.\n\nI think on new submission, the previous request details(request1 in this eg) should be reset (meaning snapshotdetails= null) on new request. \n\nThe getDetails should be returned the status of request2 instead of request1 details. This doesn't happen untill request2 either succeeds or fails.",
