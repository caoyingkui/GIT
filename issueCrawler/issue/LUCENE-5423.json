    "description": "In org.apache.lucene.util.OpenBitSet the hashCode method might return different hash codes for equal bitsets. \nThis happens when there are bits set in words right of wlen. This might happen through a getAndSet call (the documentation states that getAndSet may only be called on positions that are smaller than the size - which is the length of the array not wlen - this might be another issue).",
