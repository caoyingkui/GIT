            "content": "Notes from SOLR-2894 about the root of the issue...\n\n\nFrom what I can tell, the gist of the issue is that when dealing with sub-fields of the pivot, the coordination code doesn't know about some of the \"0\" values if no shard which has the value for the parent field even knows about the existence of the term.\n\nThe simplest example of this discrepency (compared to single node pivots) is to consider an index with only 2 docs...\n\n\n[{\"id\":1,\"top_s\":\"foo\",\"sub_s\":\"bar\"}\n {\"id\":2,\"top_s\":\"xxx\",\"sub_s\":\"yyy\"}]\n\n\n\nIf those two docs exist in a single node index, and you pivot on top_s,sub_s using mincount=0 you get a response like this...\n\n\n$ curl -sS 'http://localhost:8881/solr/select?q=*:*&rows=0&facet=true&facet.pivot.mincount=0&facet.pivot=top_s,sub_s&omitHeader=true&wt=json&indent=true'\n{\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":2,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[]\n  },\n  \"facet_counts\":{\n    \"facet_queries\":{},\n    \"facet_fields\":{},\n    \"facet_dates\":{},\n    \"facet_ranges\":{},\n    \"facet_intervals\":{},\n    \"facet_pivot\":{\n      \"top_s,sub_s\":[{\n          \"field\":\"top_s\",\n          \"value\":\"foo\",\n          \"count\":1,\n          \"pivot\":[{\n              \"field\":\"sub_s\",\n              \"value\":\"bar\",\n              \"count\":1},\n            {\n              \"field\":\"sub_s\",\n              \"value\":\"yyy\",\n              \"count\":0}]},\n        {\n          \"field\":\"top_s\",\n          \"value\":\"xxx\",\n          \"count\":1,\n          \"pivot\":[{\n              \"field\":\"sub_s\",\n              \"value\":\"yyy\",\n              \"count\":1},\n            {\n              \"field\":\"sub_s\",\n              \"value\":\"bar\",\n              \"count\":0}]}]}}}\n\n\n\nIf however you index each of those docs on a seperate shard, the response comes back like this...\n\n\n$ curl -sS 'http://localhost:8881/solr/select?q=*:*&rows=0&facet=true&facet.pivot.mincount=0&facet.pivot=top_s,sub_s&omitHeader=true&wt=json&indent=true&shards=localhost:8881/solr,localhost:8882/solr'\n{\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":2,\"start\":0,\"maxScore\":1.0,\"docs\":[]\n  },\n  \"facet_counts\":{\n    \"facet_queries\":{},\n    \"facet_fields\":{},\n    \"facet_dates\":{},\n    \"facet_ranges\":{},\n    \"facet_intervals\":{},\n    \"facet_pivot\":{\n      \"top_s,sub_s\":[{\n          \"field\":\"top_s\",\n          \"value\":\"foo\",\n          \"count\":1,\n          \"pivot\":[{\n              \"field\":\"sub_s\",\n              \"value\":\"bar\",\n              \"count\":1}]},\n        {\n          \"field\":\"top_s\",\n          \"value\":\"xxx\",\n          \"count\":1,\n          \"pivot\":[{\n              \"field\":\"sub_s\",\n              \"value\":\"yyy\",\n              \"count\":1}]}]}}}\n\n\n\nThe only solution i can think of, would be an extra (special to mincount=0) stage of logic, after each PivotFacetField is refined, that would:\n\n\titerate over all the values of the current pivot\n\tbuild up a Set of all all the known values for the child-pivots of of those values\n\titerate over all the values again, merging in a \"0\"-count child value for every value in the set\n\n\n\n...ie: \"At least one shard knows about value 'v_x' in field 'sub_field', so add a count of '0' for 'v_x' in every 'sub_field' collection nested under the 'top_field' in our 'top_field,sub_field' pivot\"\n\nI haven't thought this idea through enough to be confident it would work, or that it's worth doing ... i'm certainly not convinced that mincount=0 makes enough sense in a facet.pivot usecase to think getting this test working should hold up getting this committed \u2013 probably something that should just be committed as is, with an open Jira that it's a known bug.\n\n\nSOLR-2894 includes a commented out test case related to using mincount=0 in distributed pivot faceting in DistributedFacetPivotLargeTest (annotated with \"SOLR-6329\") "
