    "description": "We know we need _nest_path_\u00a0in the schema for the new nested documents support, and we loosely know what goes in it.  From a DocValues perspective, we've got it down; though we might tweak it.  From an indexing (text analysis) perspective, we're not quite sure yet, though we've got a test schema, schema-nest.xml with a decent shot at it.  Ultimately, how we index it will depend on the query/filter use-cases we need to support.  So we'll review some of them here.\n\nTBD: Not sure if the outcome of this task is just a \"decide\" or wether we also potentially add a few tests for some of these cases, and/or if we also add a FieldType to make declaring it as easy as a one-liner.  A FieldType would have other benefits too once we're ready to make querying on the path easier.",
