            "content": "Took a look at the patch, here are my thoughts:\n\nLike:\n\n\trename of handleResponse\n\tfluent style for addMetadata (returning the command)\n\tcreate and delete sections of results \n\tNice cleanup in invokeAction, especially collecting and propagating the exception earlier.\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\tWhy is remoteInvoke on RouedAliasCreateCollectionCommand when it's only used from TimeRoutedAliasUpdateProcessor?\n\tRename field on zkstateReader aliasesHolder to aliasesManager?\n\tYou added 2 parseSolrDateToInstant() methods with different params, but neither seems to be used?\n\tin your cleanup of invokeAction etc, you seem to have dropped some conditionals looking for null or -1 error codes, which was added by MarkMiller in 2013... (bottom of handleResponse, which is now sentToOCPQueue) Any idea what that was trapping? Why is it not needed now?\n\n\n\nThought about:\n\n\tThinking about the validation in TimeRoutedAlias ... Does seem that if an alias metadata gets messed up causing validation issue, all operations sending data to that alias will start failing. This worried me initially, but is probably ok. Must not get used in ModifyAlias in the future, since that would make it impossible to repair broken metadata. Not something we are doing now, but a potential pitfall. In constructor validation of values often worries me due to the inability to model busted state if state becomes busted.\n\tWe seem to rely on applyModificationandExportToZk to ensure that the alias is updated before deleting collections, but I think that's a little risky given the need for zookeeper watches to update. If we delete collections quickly after that nodes that have not processed watch notifications may send to the deleted shard? Do we need another (ugly, but magic) 100ms wait\n\tI think we can worry about making deletion async if that becomes a pain point later. Simple to start as you have it now is good.\n\n\n\nSuggest:\n\n\tJavadoc for deleteCollectionsAndUpdateAlias() - especially explanation of the correct notion for the \"from\" parameter.\n\tSimilarly doc for autoDeleteBeforeTime property on TimeRoutedAlias... time stuff is always fiddly, helps to have some doc. Not sure why it's not autoDeleteAfterInterval? Maybe you mean autoDeleteIfBefore?\n\n ",

            "content": "Why is remoteInvoke on RouedAliasCreateCollectionCommand when it's only used from TimeRoutedAliasUpdateProcessor?\n\nI thought it might be nice to have a static method on the command with typed arguments so that it's (a) easy to invoke remotely, and (b) keeps details of composing & writing the message in one class.  Do you think this is worse?\n\nRename field on zkstateReader aliasesHolder to aliasesManager?\n\n+1 will do\n\nYou added 2 parseSolrDateToInstant() methods with different params, but neither seems to be used?\n\nWhoops. I'll delete them; they are one-liners any way.\n\nyou seem to have dropped some conditionals looking for null or -1 error codes\n\nThat moved to a new method on SolrResponse: getException().  I appreciate it's complicated to follow this in the diff; I found the original code being refactored difficult to understand.\n\nThinking about the validation in TimeRoutedAlias...\n\nGood commentary... yeah something to be mindful of in ModifyAlias in the future.\n\nWe seem to rely on applyModificationandExportToZk to ensure that the alias is updated before deleting collections, but I think that's a little risky...\n\nThe code here is running on the node that has the Overseer, and thus issuing an admin command to delete the collection from the same node \"sees\" the same state (I think).  If I'm wrong, what you describe doesn't sound serious?  deleteOldestCollectionsAndUpdateAlias() will not throw an exception (thus won't prevent creating next collection), it will return errors in the overseer message response if there are any (results.add(...)).  If this comes to pass, we could modify DeleteCollectionCmd to ensure it's aliases is up to date first.\n\nJavadoc/doc\n\n+1 will do. ",
