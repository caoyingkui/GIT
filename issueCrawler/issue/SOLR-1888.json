    "description": "As I stumbled over a lot of copy pasting while creating java annotated beans representing a schema.xml, i decided to make a shortcut and create a maven plugin.\n\nThink about it as source generation similar to castor/jaxb code generation from an xsd. You just point to a schema.xml and connect to the generate-sources phase. This leads to a java bean in target/generated-sources/solr that contains all fields from the schema well annotated. \n\nThe mapping reads the <fields> section and maps field=\"string\" to solr.StringField to java.lang String etc. Multivalured fields generate lists, dynamic fields Maps. Currently the code generation is plain simple, just a fileWriter with some intends. The getValidJavaName(String name) may act more professional than now.\n\nJust install the plugin contained in the zip using mvn install and connect it to an existing solrj project:\n\n{{\n<plugin>\n\t     <groupId>org.apache.solr</groupId>\n\t     <artifactId>maven-solr-plugin</artifactId>\n\t     <configuration>\n\t       <schemaFile>test-data/solr/conf/schema.xml</schemaFile>\n\t       <qualifiedName>org.test.MyBean</qualifiedName>\n\t     </configuration>\n\t     <executions>\n          <execution>\n            <phase>generate-sources</phase>\n            <goals>\n              <goal>generate</goal>\n            </goals>\n          </execution>\n        </executions>\n </plugin>\n}}\n\nThe generated fiels will be automatically added to the classpath after the first run of mvn generate/compile. So just execute mvn eclipse:eclipse once after that. After every change in the schema, generate again and your bean will be updated and fields and getters and setters will be present.",
