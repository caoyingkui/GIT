I think it would be, via the MDCLoggingContext stuff added later under SOLR-7590.\n\nSo +1 for RecoveryStrategy not being a Thread then. ",

I thought about setting the name of the current thread inside run(), however, the executor where this is ran from already handles thread names (added with MDC logging changes as you say). ",
