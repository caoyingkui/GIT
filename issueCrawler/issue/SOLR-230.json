    "description": "SOLR-86 create post.jar which eliminated the need for post.sh ... but as noticed in \nSOLR-164 there are still some cases in the tutorial that require direct use of curl (deleting) and there are some nice things about post.sh that post.jar doesn't support (defaulting the URL)\n\nthis issue is to tackle some of the ideas Bertrand and I posted as a comment in SOLR-86 after it was resolved....\n\nBertrand Delacretaz [19/Feb/07 12:35 AM] ...\nConsidering the tutorial examples (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html), it'd be useful to allow this to POST its standard input, or the contents of a command-line parameter: ...\n\nHoss Man [19/Feb/07 11:50 AM]\nyeah ... i think we should hardcode http://localhost:8983/solr/update with a possible override by system prop, then add either a command line switch other another system prop indicating to use the command line as filenames or as raw data, and another op for stdin.\n\njava -jar -Ddata=files post.jar *.xml\njava -jar post.jar *.xml ... data=files being the default\necho \"<delete><query>name:DDR</query></delete>\" | java -jar -Ddata=stdin post.jar\ncat *.xml | java -jar -Ddata=stdin post.jar\njava -jar -Ddata=args post.jar \"<delete><query>name:DDR</query></delete>\"\njava -jar -Durl=http://localhost:8983/solr/update post.jar *.xml",

            "content": "patch that tackles all of these changes ... modifies SimplePostTool a well as the tutorial.\n\nnote two small differences between what i proposed and what I implemented...\n  1) \"cat *.xml | post -Ddata=stdin -jar post.jar\" does not work because when reading from stdin we have 1 and only one stream to post, and the examples files themselves contain the <add> blocks.  \"cat *.xml | post -Ddata=stdin -jar post.jar\" does work however\n  2) i added a \"commit\" system prop and defaulted it to \"yes\" ... this is needed because when deleting in the tutorial it wants to show off the pending dleetes and the fact that the doc is still there until you commit.\n\nfor what it's worth there is now also simple support for  \"-help\" option, but i don't know if we should advertise it ... if anyone is using post.jar beyond what is described in theetutorial, they should relaly look at the code itself.
