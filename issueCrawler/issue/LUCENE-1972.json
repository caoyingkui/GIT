            "content": "This patch removes ExtendedFieldCache bw layer. It also removes the AUTO and CUSTOM caches.\n\nBecause of that, also lot's of SortField logic was also changed and deprecations removed (not yet complete, HitCollector is still there). But with this patch most of the deprecated sort logic is removed (old Collectors, old sorting collectors, legacy search,...)\n\nI also converted the Sort() ctors/setSort methods to varargs and changed the tests. It's now easier to use.\n\nWill commit, when all tests were run again and nobody complains. This patch may miss to remove some dead code, but this should be done later, when the inventors of the new Search API look closer over it. ",
