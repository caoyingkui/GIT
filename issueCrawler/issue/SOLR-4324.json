And deleteAll will call IDF#refresh which removing newly created unreferenced files.\n\nBut when IndexWriter#deleteAll is running, solr is add docs to the slice at the same time. So IDF#refresh could delete a segment which is a newly created after call of IDF#refresh before it published to IndexWriter, and after publishFlushedSegment this segment will added to IndexWriter's segmentInfos, and this could cause indexing failed when do IndexWriter#applyAllDeletes or some operation else.",
