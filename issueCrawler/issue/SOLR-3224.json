Can you provide a shorter more concise title for the issue, and fill in more info in the description?\nIn order to verify whether this is a bug we'd need to reproduce locally. Please attach schema.xml along with a few example documents of both \"from\" and \"to\" type.\n\nAlso, how current (date) is your solr4.0?\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tDoes it work if you put the price range query as part of \"q\"?\n\tDo you experience problems with other simple non-range filters as well?\n\tWhat do you mean with \"as its result does not highlights the given range\"? Are you talking about result highlighting?\n\n "
