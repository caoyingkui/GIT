    "description": "Triggers determine whether to generate events by measuring if the time since the last event is greater than waitFor or not. That is not the intended purpose of waitFor. They should actually keep checking whether the violation remains for the duration of the waitFor time, and only then generate events.\n\nThis is further complicated by the fact that all triggers are paused whenever an event is being processed (SOLR-11747). It seems that instead they should not be paused but continue running to properly track the cluster state - they just should not generate any events, or their events should be IGNORED.",
