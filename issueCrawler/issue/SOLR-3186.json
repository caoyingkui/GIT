    "description": "If you are bootstrapping a multi-core setup, you currently have to settle for the same numShards for every core. We really should support a way of specifying this per core without having to use the CoreAdminHandler to dynamically create the cores. Currently I am thinking we just add numShards to what you can specify per core in solr.xml. I know it's a little odd because the param is only used once on the very first node for the collection - but as long as we doc it correctly, I don't think its much of a problem.",
