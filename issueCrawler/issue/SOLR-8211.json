    "description": "Currently atomic update is supported only on unique id field. It becomes painful when we have to update bulk of documents which matches a criteria. Currently we have to run a query to fetch all the unique ids and then submit update query for each one of them. It would be great if atomic update also supports <query></query> similar to delete request.",

I agree it would be convenient, but between the unexpected work you could do (i.e. re-indexing your entire corpus) and the difficulty I suspect there would be in making this robust in a distributed environment, I rather doubt it'll generate much interest.
