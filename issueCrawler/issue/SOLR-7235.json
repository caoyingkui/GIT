    "description": "I tried using solr.TruncateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory in my local environment and tried to truncate one string to 5000 character but it did not work because my php client is using solarium as solr client and it sends data as a map, for example  my field name is xyz and solarium is sending its value as \"set:<required value>\" where \"set\" is the key and \"<require value>\" is the value of map. According to this factory code it checks if this \"xyz\" field's value is a CharSequence or not, if it is then it truncates that string. But because it is not a char sequence then it is not even trying truncating. To make it work in my  instance I had to override solr.TruncateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory.",
