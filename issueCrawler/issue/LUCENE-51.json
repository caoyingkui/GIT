I made the following \nchanges to QueryParser.jj, and it seems work fine.  I am not sure if there is \nany side effect though.  Can someone verify this?\n\nChange from:\n\n\n\n\n <WILDTERM:  <_TERM_START_CHAR> \n              (<_TERM_CHAR> \n ( [ \"\", \"?\" ] )) >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n\n\n\n\n <WILDTERM:  (<_TERM_CHAR> \n ( [ \"\", \"?\" ] )) >",
