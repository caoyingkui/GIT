    "description": "SOLR-4189 added sensitivity to sysprop tests.jettyConnector to allow setting test mode Jetty to use Socket connector instead of the default SelectChannel connector.\n\nNew module lucene/replicator is running into the same problem, failing 100% of the time when running under 'ant nightly-smoke' on ASF Jenkins on FreeBSD.\n\nAt present there's no way from smokeTestRelease.py, or from \"ant nightly-smoke\", to pass through this sysprop (or any other).\n\nRobert Muir wrote on dev@l.o.a about one of the replicator module's failures on FreeBSD:\n\n\nThis is a jenkins setup/test harness issue.\n\nthere needs to be a way for the jetty connector sysprop to be passed\nall the way thru to ant test running from the smoketester.",
