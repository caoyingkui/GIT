    "description": "I'm a little out of my comfort zone, so mostly posting this for discussion. If, for any reason, ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient doesn't get a response from a replica (say a network glitch or the like), it seems to initiate a LIR on the replica. This is around line 243 in 5.3.2, and the corresponding code in 6x looks unchanged on a quick perusal.\n\nThis is fragile in the sense that a simple retry could avoid the replica going into recovery if the problem is transient.\n\nWhether there is retrying higher in the stack I'm not quite sure, but we're seeing this behavior in the field so I'm posting this here for discussion, I've had a back-channel discussion already so a JIRA seems in order.\n\nThe other thing I'm not entirely sure of is whether retrying at this point in the process is something that will avoid versioning problems.",
