    "description": "This patch adds a trivial option to allow for query slop within the DisMaxRequestHandler. Now it is possible to allow for out-of-order characters within query phrase tokens. This uses the same syntax as the phrase slop option. To use this, use the 'qs' option as an argument. (This addition made with Hoss's guidance).",
