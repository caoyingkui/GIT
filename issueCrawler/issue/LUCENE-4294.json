    "description": "The main test methods in checkindex can just work on AtomicReader, so expose these as static methods, and add _TestUtil.checkReader (similar to checkIndex).\n\nThis would allow for us to verify consistency of things like ParallelReader/SlowWrapper (and thus Multi*) or whatever.\n\nIts a simple patch, but I'm not sure where to inject the check so we do it automagically (or at least sometimes automagically)",
