    "description": "It would be really great if we could get feedback to contributors sooner on many things that are basic (tests exist, patch applies cleanly, etc.)\n\nFrom Nigel Daley on builds@a.o\n\n\nI revamped the precommit testing in the fall so that it doesn't use Jira email anymore to trigger a build.  The process is controlled by\nhttps://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-Admin/\nwhich has some documentation up at the top of the job.  You can look at the config of the job (do you have access?) to see what it's doing.  Any project could use this same admin job \u2013 you just need to ask me to add the project to the Jira filter used by the admin job (https://issues.apache.org/jira/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/12313474/SearchRequest-12313474.xml?tempMax=100 ) once you have the downstream job(s) setup for your specific project.  For Hadoop we have 3 downstream builds configured which also have some documentation:\nhttps://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/\nhttps://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/\nhttps://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/",
