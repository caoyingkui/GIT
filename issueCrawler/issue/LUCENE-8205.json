I'd be lovely for this part to be pluggable and have gradually more complex implementations (like simple text in codecs)... \n\nFor example, I always lacked the \"big picture\" overview of how things in indexing work (DWPT, deletes, generations with respect to commits, etc.). The code is an ultimate resource, of course, but it'd be nice to have better docs for this. ",
