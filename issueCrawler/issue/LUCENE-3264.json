            "content": "Patch looks very good. All tests pass for me (I've applied on trunk only).\n\nFew things I've noticed:\n\n\tPreviously the tests took 1m20s to run, now they take 2m55s. I guess it's because previously we only created RAMDirs, while now newDirectory picks FSDir from time to time (10%?).\n\n\n\n\n\tFacetTestUtils.close*() can be removed and calls replaced by IOUtils.closeSafely. This is not critical, just remove redundant code.\n\n\n\n\n\tYou added a TODO to CategoryListIteratorTest about the test failing if TieredMP is used. In general TieredMP is not good for the taxonomy index, which relies on Lucene doc IDs, and therefore segments must be merged in-order. LTW uses LMP specifically because of that. I will look into the test to understand why would it care about doc IDs, since it doesn't using the taxonomy index at all.\n\n\n\n\n\tThere are few places with code like: assertTrue(\"Would like to test this with deletions!\",indexReader.hasDeletions()), and assertTrue(\"Would like to test this with deletions!\",indexReader.numDeletedDocs() > 0) which you removed. Any reason?\n\n\n\n\n\tYou added a TODO to TestScoredDocIDsUtils (about reader is read-only) \u2013 you're right, the comment can be deleted.\n\n\n\nWhile I reviewed, I was thinking that RandomIndexWriter is used to replace the IndexWriter for content indexing. While this is good, this does not cover the 'taxonomy' indexing. So I wonder if we should have under facet/test/o.a.l.utils a RandomTaxonomyWriter which opens RIW internally?\n\nThis is very impressive progress Robert, thanks for doing it !\n\nI am +1 to commit, after we resolve the tiny issues I raised above. We can add RandomTaxonomyWriter as a follow-on commit. ",

Anyway, as said in the issue summary, for a number of reasons, I don't want to address this on this issue, I want to address the coverage first.\n\n\nFacetTestUtils.close*() can be removed and calls replaced by IOUtils.closeSafely. This is not critical, just remove redundant code.\n\nah, you are right. let's change this.\n\n\nYou added a TODO to CategoryListIteratorTest about the test failing if TieredMP is used.

I will look into the test to understand why would it care about doc IDs, since it doesn't using the taxonomy index at all.\n\nRight, as you said this is for the main index, not the taxonomy index. So I think the test just relies upon lucene doc ids, but I didnt want to just change the test without saying why.\n\n\nThere are few places with code like: assertTrue(\"Would like to test this with deletions!\",indexReader.hasDeletions()), and assertTrue(\"Would like to test this with deletions!\",indexReader.numDeletedDocs() > 0) which you removed. Any reason?\n\nMostly to prevent the tests from failing. RandomIndexWriter randomly optimizes some times, so occasionally there are no deletions. I think this is fine (actually better) as far as coverage... then the deleted docs is occasionally null, etc.\n\n\nYou added a TODO to TestScoredDocIDsUtils (about reader is read-only) \u2013 you're right, the comment can be deleted.\n\nOK, I'll nuke this.\n\n\nWe can add RandomTaxonomyWriter as a follow-on commit.\n\nYes, lets do this separate.

I was just asking, since all you've done is move to use newDir, newIWC and RandomIW, how come the tests running time got that much longer? If it's not FSDir, do you have any idea what can cause that?

Will RandomIW stall indexing randomly, or maybe it's newIWC which chooses to flush more often?\n\nI think the slowdown is basically linear (the tests run 2x or 3x as slow). Let me explain some of the reasons why you have this slowdown over just normal indexing without using randomiw/mockdirectorywrapper/etc:\n\n\twe call checkIndex on every directory we create after its closed. I think this is the right thing to do always... it does slow down the tests a bit.\n\twe do sometimes get crappy indexing params, crazy merge params, ridiculous IndexReader/Writer params (e.g. termIndexInterval=1). I think sometimes these non-optimal params slow things down.\n\toccasionally we do things like randomly fully or partially optimize, yield(), etc.\n\n\n\nSo while Lucene's defaults are pretty good, we are testing a bunch of non-default parameters and doing a bunch of other crazy things... so these slow down the tests!\n\nThat being said, I'm working on the speed issue at least a little here, because I really want to get this test improvements in,  although I really didn't want to work on this here (I think 1 minute extra temporarily to the build is no big deal for the additional coverage).
