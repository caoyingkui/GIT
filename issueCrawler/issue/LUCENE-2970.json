    "description": "in an application of mine, i experienced some very slow query times with finite automata (all the DFAs are acyclic)\n\nIt turned out, the slowdown is some terrible runtime in SpecialOperations.isFinite <-- this is used to determine if the DFA is acyclic or not.\n\n(in this case I am talking about even up to minutes of cpu).",

So, I keep \"visited\" for this.\n\nAdditionally I changed it to use a Bitset instead of a HashSet, which helps the speed (but just a constant-time speedup).\n\nI took the old code, dumped it into AutomatonTestUtil as \"isFiniteSimple\" and the test just generates random automata and compares this versus the new implementation.\n\nI'd appreciate any reviews/suggestions any automaton-hackers want to give here.

Their description of DFS colors the nodes \u2013 white is unvisited, black is visited, gray is \"being visited\" (ie on my current path).  A DFA then has a cycle if every you recurse and find a gray node.\n\nIn your patch, the combination of \"path\" and \"visited\" maps to these colors, and you detect a cycle when path is set and visited is not.\n\nMaybe rename the test-only isFiniteSimple to isFiniteSLOW or something?\n\nDoes the new random test case tend not to hit the super-slow cases...?

Though i'm not sure how \"great\" of NFAs AutomatonTestUtil.randomAutomaton generates?\nif all else fails we can det as a side effect (this won't hurt lucene), but I'd like to know for sure, and to send the patch upstream.\n\n\nMaybe rename the test-only isFiniteSimple to isFiniteSLOW or something?\n\nDoes the new random test case tend not to hit the super-slow cases...?\n\nThe test definitely got faster, but maybe the type of DFAs i generate are not represented fairly by the random generator? In other words they are \"worst-case\" for the old method, but they are \"reasonable\" as far as queries, finite and contained as far as the number of terms they accept.\n\n ",
