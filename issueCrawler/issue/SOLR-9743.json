            "content": "Interesting. We've always been \"collection centric\", where the hardware is left \"as an exercise for the reader\". This seems more operations wide, \"I just got some new hardware, here Solr, make use of it\". Cool!\n\nI'm not sure I see the use-case for the version without the collection name, doubtless you have something in mind here. My immediate reaction though is that if the version that adds replicas to all collections is at all difficult I could live without it and have collection be required (and perhaps multiValued?). Although I supposed if you allow a multivalued collection parameter the leap from there to doing it for every collection is trivial code-wise, it'd just be whether you read the list from the param or got a list of collections from ZK...
