    "description": "I would like to propose a TwoPhaseCommit interface which declares the methods necessary to implement a 2-phase commit algorithm:\n\n\tprepareCommit()\n\tcommit()\n\trollback()\n\n\n\nThe prepare/commit ones have variants that take a (Map<String,String> commitData) following the ones we have in IndexWriter.\n\nIn addition, a TwoPhaseCommitTool which implements a 2-phase commit amongst several TPCs.\n\nHaving IndexWriter implement that interface will allow running the 2-phase commit algorithm on multiple IWs or IW + any other object that implements the interface.\n\nWe should mark the interface @lucene.internal so as to not block ourselves in the future. This is pretty advanced stuff anyway.\n\nWill post a patch soon",

I don't\nreally understand what it takes to be \"XA capable\", but I assume it\nmeans building the right wrapper around IW's existing transactional\nAPIs (like this).\n\nShouldn't TwoPhaseCommit be @lucene.experimental instead (not\ninternal)?  Ie, the idea is an app can also impl this interface, and\nthen use execute to commit all resources.\n\nJavadocs should maybe state that on rollback the writer will have been\nclosed?  (rollback closes the writer)\n\nOne possible issue: if exceptions are hit in .commit(), which ought to\nbe rare since prepareCommit does all the \"hard work\", we go and\n.rollback() all resources, even those that had successfully .commit'd,\nright?  But, in general, this is tricky for a resource to handle\n(rolling back when commit had succeeded).  EG, IndexWriter won't do\nthis correctly \u2013 rollback will be a no-op in this case since it rolls\nback to the last successful commit.\n\nThis is actually correctable, but it requires some more work to\nproperly wrap the IndexWriter.

I'll fix !\n\nJavadocs should maybe state that on rollback the writer will have been closed?\n\nThis is mentioned in IndexWriter.rollback().

This way caller can differentiate this case?\n\nGood idea. So instead of throwing IOE, we'll throw (Prepare)CommitFailException which takes a Throwable 'cause' and TPC 'obj'. We can make the two sub-class IOE for convenience (in case someone does not want to differentiate the two, it's easier to handle both cases in one catch block).\n\nI'll add these and upload a new patch by tomorrow.
