You can use _TestUtil#randomSimpleString(Random, int maxLength).\n\nIn fact, using random segment suffix is very difficult to achieve, as we cannot ensure that the codec instantiated through SPI will get the same segment suffix as the codec instantiated in the TestCompressingStoredFieldsFormat#setUp(), and therefore the _TestUtil#checkIndex(Directory dir) will fail. The segment suffix must be deterministic, e.g., similar to the current solution using the formatName as segment suffix. ",
