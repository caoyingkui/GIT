    "description": "Currently there's no way for an app to upgrade a taxonomy index to the newest index format. The problem is, that unlike search indexes which may merge segments often, the taxonomy index is not likely to do many merges. At some point, most taxonomies become fixed (i.e. new categories are not/rarely added), and therefore it could be that some old segments will never get merged.\n\nWhen we'll release Lucene 5.0, support for 3x indexes will be removed, and so taxonomies that were created w/ 3x won't be read anymore.\n\nWhile one can use IndexUpgrader (I think) to upgrade the taxonomy index, it may not be so trivial for users to realize that, as it may not be so evident from DirTaxoWriter/Reader API that there's a regular Lucene index behind the scenes.\n\nA tool, like TaxonomyUpgraderTool, even if simple and using IndexUpgrader, may make it more convenient for user to upgrade their taxonomy index.\n\nOpening as a placeholder for 5.0. Also marking as blocker, so we don't forget about it before the release.",
