    "description": "As noted by J\u00f8rgen Trosby on the solr mailing list (subj: \"SolrEventListeners are instantiated twice\", \"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 18:11:07 +0200\") there is a problem with how SolrEventListeners are being created and initialized\n\nthe bug is two fold: \n\n\n\tthe UpdatedHandler and the SolrCore both independently loop over all SolrEventListeners looking for the two classes of use cases they directly care about (postCommit/postOptimize vs newSearcher/firstSearcher) \u2013 in both cases they construct every declared listener even if it is not a type they care about\n\teven when UpdatedHandler is finding a postCommit it cared about, it throws it away and constructing it again.",
