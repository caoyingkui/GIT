    "description": "I'd like to refactor all the ResponseWriters to be a bit less brittle. ResponseWriters should follow a standard interface with more existing methods than is currently present in the interface, and with lots of refactored utility code and more concrete control/data flow. I'll take a hard look at the existing response writers and try to generalize.\n\nSee this thread for background:\n\nhttp://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/e8bb6cac84c1f520/namespaces_in_response_solr_1586#cc50ba9e9d8fe2dc",
