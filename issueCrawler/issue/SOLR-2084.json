It seems to be making some odd decisions about when to use a multi-part request, and if it decides it doesn't need a multipart request, then it assumes there is exactly one ContentStream \u2013 there is no accounting for the possibility of an UpdateRequest that has zero streams.\n\n(I'm not sure why UpdateRequest works even when no documents have been added ... it must tickle some change in the code path)\n\nIt's seems like we should just simplify the code to always use multipart when doing POST requests, and then a simple loop over the list of ContentStreams should work just fine.
