If BSD is an approved license, it would be nice if RAT would recognize it and then we could just add it to these files. But RAT doesn't appear to. It just looks for \"http://dojotoolkit.org/community/licensing.shtml\" and \"TMF854 Version 1.0 - Copyright TeleManagement Forum\" - which it considers modified BSD. Weak.\n\nAnyway, NOTICE should also state the license for Snowball along with the copyright as well. (reads weird - i know the copyright is there with a link - but it should state the license as well) ",
