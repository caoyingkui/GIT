In general, it could be useful to get the minimum and maximum from any field type that can be compared, though that's of less importance.",

But that toObject method isn't available in branch_3x as he pointed out, so the whole FieldType to SchemaField change is probably not needed there. Much of the diff stems from this.\n\n(b) generalized class DoubleStatsValues extends AbstractStatsValues<Double> to class NumericStatsValues extends AbstractStatsValues<Number>\n\n(c) made DateStatsValues extend AbstractStatsValues<Date> (as it should) instead of AbstractStatsValues<String>, with the simplifications that allowed.\n\n(d) fixed some indentation bloopers from me.\n\nI've updated my branch_3x SVN patch with changes (b), (c) and (d), attaching.
