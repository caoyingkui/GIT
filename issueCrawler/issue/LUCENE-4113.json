    "description": "This patch contains: \n\n\n\tFieldTermStack.TermInfo has now a field TermInfo.weight (float), which holds the index-weight (IDF) of the corresponding term\n\tFieldPhraseList.WeightedPhraseInfo has now a field WeightedPhraseInfo.termsInfos (ArrayList<TermInfo>), which provides  information about the contained terms within the corresponding phrase\n\tWeightedPhraseInfo.addIfNoOverlap() no longer dumps the second part of a hyphenated word (for example: social-economics)\n\tFieldQueryTest has been updated\n\n\n\nRegarding test-cases: \nTermInfo.toString() wasn't modified, thus, test-cases remain pretty much the same except the additional parameter for TermInfo-constructor. \n\nThis is the third (see LUCENE-4091, LUCENE-4107) patch aiming at the introduction of another method for weighting fragments (see LUCENE-3440).",
