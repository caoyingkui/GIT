    "description": "Session aggregation can be hard to do at scale. MapReduce of course makes this easy. Now that we have MapReduce it would be good to add some session aggregations to the base library. \n\nThe Path reduce operation can be used with the reduce function to concatenate the path taken in a session into a single field. These path records can then be added to another SolrCloud collection using the update stream. Once they have been consolidated in another collection aggregations can be run on the paths using the RollupStream.\n\nA HashRollupStream could also be developed to aggregate the paths as they are reduced. The HashRollupStream would keep all the paths in a hash map during the aggregation so it would not require the paths to be received in order.\n\nsample syntax:\n\n\nreduce(search(logs, q=\"*:*\", sort=\"sessionId, timestamp\", ...),\n       by=\"sessionId\",\n       path(field=\"pageId\"))\n\n\n\nThis would work great in parallel by partitioning on the sessionId.",
