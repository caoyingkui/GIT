    "description": "SearchComponents that use a previously computed document set should have an option to specify which document set to use. SearchComponents that output a document set should have the option to overwrite the default document set.\n\nFor example, when using a FacetComponent after a MoreLikeThisComponent, you should be able to tell the FacetComponent to use either the document set created by the QueryComponent or by the MoreLikeThisComponent. You should also be able to tell the MoreLikeThisComponent to overwrite the QueryComponent's document set.\n\nRelated discussion:\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Faceting-MoreLikeThisComponent-results-to19206833.html",
