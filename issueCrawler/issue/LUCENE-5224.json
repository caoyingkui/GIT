    "description": "There are some Hunspell dictionaries that need to emulate Unicode normalization and collation in order to get the correct stem of a word. The original Hunspell provides a way to do this with the ICONV and OCONV lines in the affix file. The Lucene HunspellDictionary ignores these lines right now.\n\nPlease support these keys in the affix file.\n\nThis bit of functionality is briefly described in the hunspell man page http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man4/hunspell.4.html\n\nThis functionality is practically required in order to use a Korean dictionary because you want only some of the Jamos of a Hangul character (grapheme cluster) when using stemming. Other languages will find this to be helpful functionality.\n\nHere is an example for a .aff file:\n\n\nICONV \uac01 \u1100\u1161\u11a8\n...\nOCONV \u1100\u1161\u11a8 \uac01\n\n\n\nHere is the same example escaped.\n\n\nICONV \\uAC01 \\u1100\\u1161\\u11A8\n...\nOCONV \\u1100\\u1161\\u11A8 \\uAC01",

So this patch adjusts those to reality.\n\nLater, I'll make a second @Ignore'd test similar to my current \"TestAllDictionaries\" but using the list from thunderbird, which has much newer ones than the one referenced from the old openoffice link. This way I can ensure newer dictionaries like this one are working, too. ",
