It could be that this was also caused by the mentioned issues.\n\nIf all is fine on Linux, I'd change the common-build.xml and remove the Java 9 special case and leave HDFS with Windows disabled only.

So I have no idea, but in my Linux VM at that time I have seen tons of failures primarily on Hadoop tests, so I disabled them.\n\nBe sure to check again with build 158, as there were some changes, including SecurityManager.\n\nOtherwise +1 to revert the above 2 commits done by me. Hoss Man: Should I do it, or will you do it? I'd take the issue in that case. ",
