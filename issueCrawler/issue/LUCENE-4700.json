    "description": "Today these two are per FacetIndexingParams, which means that once defined, they affect all category lists. This prevents for example to index one category list with OrdinalPolicy.NO_PARENTS and another with OrdinalPolicy.ALL_PARENTS. Especially now that we know NO_PARENTS is faster (see LUCENE-4600), it will be good if users can control this setting per CategoryListParams, and index only the few facets which a document has more than once (e.g. Author) in a separate category list.",

            "content": "Following the recent facets work, I think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things (in addition to what I described above):\n\n\n\tMake OrdinalPolicy an enum with two constants (ALL/NO_PARENTS). It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600), and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide.\n\t\n\t\tRather, if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below, he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder.\n\t\tFor the search side, he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tNuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one, but it looks like we can get rid of it too.\n\n ",
