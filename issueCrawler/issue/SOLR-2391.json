Also the XSLTResponseWriter incorrectly parses media-type + encoding <xsl:output> properties (exaples are not 100% correct). 100% correct examples would set media-type to application/xml and encoding to UTF-8 in xsl:output.",

            "content": "Here some fixes to the XSLs and Content-Types:\n\n\tReplaced text/xml by application/xml everywhere\n\t<xsl:output media-type=.... should never contain charset, this is put into <xsl:output encoding=... - problem was XSLTRequestHandler ignoring this property, which is fixed now\n\tping.jsp is broken because it used deprecated and already removed methods - removed.\n\tXMLRequestHandlers stylesheet parameter for browser-side XSL transform was restricted to a not-working absolute /admin folder, that was hardcoded as /admin. Removed that completely and made the XSL parameter totally unparsed. In my opinion, this should be removed, client side XSL is a no-go. Also the escaping was missing!\n\n "
