            "content": "Interestingly the test sometimes passes, so it cannot be a general problem on Java 9. Does anybody have an idea why this fails.\n\nFYI: It fails more badly with Java 9 module system (I opened a separate issue about that), because it tries to get access to private (security) APIs of the JVM that are shielded in Java 9 (similar to Unsafe). So we have to do something about this, otherwise people won't be able to use Kerberos on Java 9, once it is out.\n\nThe current builds on Jenkins are not running on Jigsaw module system, but in the future when the module system is mature and gets merged into Java 9 mainline, it may get horrible.

            "content": "I think the problem is this test may be caused by changes in date parsing: There were some bugs in Java 9, but they are fixed now. Maybe thats another one. The reason for parsing failures maybe the change of timezone and locale databases to use CLDR (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository). It could be that the underlying library uses default locale... (which would explain why it does not fail all the time). ",
