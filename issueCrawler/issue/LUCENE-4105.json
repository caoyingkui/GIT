    "description": "LUCENE-4104 documents the limit for maximum number of documents in a single index, but it is highly desirable to have Lucene detect when this limit is reached and throw a sensible exception for the user.\n\nI am not sure of the implementation details, but it seems as if IndexWriter.addDocument, addDocuments, addIndexes, and updateDocuments would be the APIs from which a new exception, call is MaxDocumentException would be thrown.",

            "content": "To facilitate testing, I would propose an expert/testing method that would bump the internal document number for a segment arbitrarily so that it could be set to say Integer.MAX_VALUE - k so that the limit could be hit by adding only a relatively small number of documents.\n\nI am not sure of the ramifications to existing code of such a gap, but since document numbers within a segment are per-segment anyway, I suspect it should be feasible, at least if it is done before any docs are added to the segment.
