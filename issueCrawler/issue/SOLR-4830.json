            "content": "Hi Johannes.\n\nAfter discussing this issue last week I asked you to report it as a bug. But looking more closely at the config, the behavior appears to have another reason.\n\nThe solution is simply to define persistent=\"true\" on the <solr> tag in solr.xml for each of the nodes.\n\nWhat happens if persistent=false, is that the node will happily host the new collection/core initially, but will never persist knowledge about it to solr.xml. So at next startup it will still only startup the \"yp\" core which was pre-defined in solr.xml.\n\nNote that the practice of persisting the list of cores in solr.xml will disappear in Solr 4.4, when a new solr.xml format with auto core-discovery is taking over.\n\nI will close this issue, unless you still believe there is a bug somewhere "
