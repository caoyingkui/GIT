    "description": "Currently, to write a custom FragListBuilder implementation or custom highlighter, it probably will have to be placed in the org.apache.lucene.search.vectorhighlight package so that it has access to the fields in FieldPhraseList and its inner class WeightedPhraseInfo. It seems that in recent releases, getters were added for fields in many other classes in vectorhighlight, and I think it makes sense to add them for fields in FieldPhraseList as well to support such custom implementations.",

This should return List<WeightedPhraseInfo> instead?\n\twould you mind adding one or two doc strings to those getters?\n\twhile you are on it feel free to add more reasonable names etc. to that class\n\n\n\n\n ",
