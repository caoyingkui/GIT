            "content": "I think you shouldn't be worried about Virtual size. Please take a look at column which shows 1095M. Is it \"RES\" size? This would mean your heap is only 1G and maybe you send some huge document packages which causes OOM. Please let know how big is your document pack sent to /update resource.\n\nBTW I see your machine is 8GB RAM. Please remember that you can use bigger heap (-Xmx parameter for jvm). 4GB seems to be good (half of system memory). ",
