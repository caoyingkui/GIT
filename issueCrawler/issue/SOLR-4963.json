(keeping in mind the general nature of the Schema Browsing UI \u2013 we can't really add anything too specific about any one time of field (Trie or otherwise)\n\nIs there some general verbage we could add to the screen to help make it clear what you were looking at?\n\n\n "

Compared to the term splitting behavior that is evident in the schema for various text fields, the creation of additional terms in Trie fields just isn't intuitive. While this histogram output is accurate according to the details of the field contents, it differs greatly in appearance in comparison to tokenized text fields or fields that don't process their inputs. Now that I better understand what a Trie field does behind the scenes, the apparently incorrect output seems reasonable. However, it is impossible to derive much useful distribution information from the stats of a Trie field.\n\nIt comes down to comprehension of what the schema browser displays and what a Trie field adds to the index. Not properly understanding both and their relationship made this appear like a bug, with no help from my use of randomly generated dates. "
