The correct way is now to override idfExplain to change scoring for phrase queries (even it does some unneeded work like filling a StringBuilder with explanations). ",

I found it strange that a query would leverage the Explanation stuff to\n     derive scoring\nIn PyLucene, I undeprecated the idf(Collection terms, Searcher searcher) and \nimplemented it via the IDFExplanation.idfExplain() hack so that extenders of \nSimilarity don't have to see this:\n\n     public IDFExplanation idfExplain(final Collection<Term> terms,\n                                      final Searcher searcher)\n     {\n         return new IDFExplanation() {\n             public float getIdf()\n             {\n                 return idfTerms(terms, searcher);\n             }\n\n             public String explain()\n             {\n                 return null;\n             }\n         };\n     }\n\nI guess, I'm wondering why this method was deprecated since it's come back \nthrough an IDFExplanation backdoor ?
