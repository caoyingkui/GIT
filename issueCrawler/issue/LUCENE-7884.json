            "content": "Catching throwable and then trucking on in the face of whatever happened is a very dangerous pattern. What happens if you get an OOM there? The rest of your application could be in a bad state and I don't think we want to continue as we are. Better to explicitly catch NCDFE.\n\nThat said, are you running in the \"standard\" environment with Java 7, or the \"flexible\" environment with Java 8? Lucene requires Java 8, and running on 7 would get you this error. So I suspect it might be a setup issue. ",

I am using the latest Lucene version (5.5.4) that supports java 7.\n\nThe problem is actually accessing nio `Paths` results a NCDFE since google disabled it.\n\nHere is a snippet of stacktrace, thx!\n\n\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.nio.file.Paths is a restricted class.
