Thus, the update is still forwarded to the down replica and fails, and the leader then sets the replica in LiR. In a cluster where there are lots of deleteByQuery requests, this can flood the /overseer/queue.",

There might be edge cases / bugs which could lead to a replica being in down state even on a live node.\n\nThe tests pass with Jessica's original patch. \nMark Miller or Yonik Seeley any suggestions on how we can add a test case for this or is it just safe to commit the patch without an explicit test case for it?
