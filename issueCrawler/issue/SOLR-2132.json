    "description": "I think it would be useful to have the option of specifying shard \"sets\" in the shards parameter. Such that if all shards in a set are replicating from the same master (and thus have the same documents) the HTTPCommComponent will honor the first shard to respond and not wait for the subsequent shards in the same set. This will improve performance in the use case when one shard is occasionally slow and holds up the entire response. I'm not sure if this is a feature that other people want, but I thought I'd post the code none the less.\n\n-Mike",
