    "description": "Spinoff from java-user thread \"question about Scorer.freq()\" from Koji...\n\nBooleanScorer2 uses DisjunctionSumScorer to score only-SHOULD-clause boolean queries.\n\nBut, this scorer does too much work for collectors that never call .score, because it scores while it's matching.  It should only call .score on the subs when the caller calls its .score.\n\nThis also has the side effect of messing up advanced collectors that gather the freq() of the subs (using LUCENE-2590).",

Maybe this can even done without recursive calls. ",

TestSubScorerFreqs of LUCENE-2590 calls BooleanScorer2.freq() and it returns expected freq count. In my program, I get TermScorer from BooleanScorer2 via ScorerVisitor and try to call TermScorer.freq() in collect() method:\n\n\npublic void collect(int doc) throws IOException {\n  int freq = 0;\n  for( TermQueryScorer tqs : tqsSet ){\n    Scorer scorer = tqs.scorer;\n    int matchId = scorer.docID();    // matchId isn't expected\n    if( matchId == doc ){\n      freq += scorer.freq();              // this line is never executed\n    }\n  }\n  docCounts.put(doc + docBase, freq);\n  collector.collect(doc);\n}\n\n\n\nbut TermScorer.docID() returns unexpected id and TermScorer.freq() isn't executed (even if I remove \"matchId == doc\" condition, TermScorer.freq() returns unexpected number anyway).

            "content": "So... the good news is I made a new scorer (basically copied DisjunctionMaxScorer and then tweaked from there) that scores the OR-only case.  All tests pass w/ this new scorer.\n\nAnd more good news is that if you don't score (I sort by doctitle to do that), you get a speedup \u2013 7.7% in my simplistic test (prefix query unit*, expands to 988 terms, but I force it to do a scoring BQ rewrite, plus force it to use BS2 not BS \u2013 the nocommits in the patch).\n\nBut the bad news is with scoring on it's 22.7% slower!\n\nAnd, the weird news is, I discovered accidentally that BS2 is much (> 2X) faster for this one query.  I think we need to modify the criteria that decides whether to use BS or BS2...  maybe when there are lots of lowish-docFreq terms, BS2 is better? ",

            "content": "New patch attached.\n\nI added Koji's test as a unit test, that fails on trunk but passes now\nwith the patch.\n\nThe new scorer is definitely slower if you do want scoring, however,\nit's actually uncommon for this scorer to be used... because BQ will\nuse BS when the query is all SHOULD clauses (plus up to 32 NOT).\nOnly if there is also 1 or more MUST clauses will this scorer be used,\nor, if the collector does not support out-of-order scoring.  I had to\nhack BQ to temporarily turn off BS to test this.\n\nInsanely, the constant score BQ rewrite does use this scorer, because\nwhen ConstantScorer invokes the sub-scorer it requires in-order\nscoring.  So ConstantScoreQuery and constant score BQ rewrite for the\nMTQs will always see the speedup from this patch.\n\nSo given that it's rare to actually use the scorer, I think ~8% gain\nas seen by \"default\" usage makes it worthwhile net/net.\n\nLonger term... we should probably change the Weight.scorer API so that\nyou notify it up-front if you need to do scoring.  This way\nwe can specialize (manually or automatically) the best class, instead\nof waiting to see whether the .score() method is invoked per hit. ",
