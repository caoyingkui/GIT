    "description": "It'd be wonderful if I could use the \"commonness\" of one term, say the contents of a document, to power a search across both the document and its title.  Continuing the metaphor, I'd like be able to build a query like this:\n\"the first\"\nthat is rewritten into: \n(title:the OR body:the) +(title:first OR body:first)\nwith the help of the CommonTermsQuery logic.  Essentially, I'd like CommonTermsQuery to soften the implicit AND for \"the\" into and OR because it is common.",
