While this technically deviates from some of the APIs, I don't care, this is our tests, and we need to be able to debug them (not return false or no results silently).\n\nI also removed SecureDirectoryStream in these wrappers (its optional anyway, and quite complicated: we don't need any more of that), and fixed the hacky filesystem in TestIOUtils to be well-behaved. I fixed failures in the new tests if it got extrasfs as well. "
