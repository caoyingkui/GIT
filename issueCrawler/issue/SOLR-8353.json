    "description": "It would be useful to be able to specify a regex for license checksums to skip in the build.  Currently there are only two supported values:\n1) skipChecksum (i.e. regex=*)\n2) skipSnapshotsChecksum (i.e. regex=SNAPSHOT)\n\nA regex would be more flexible and allow testing the entire build while skipping a more limited set of checksums, e.g.:\na) an individual library (i.e. regex=joda-time*)\nb) a suite of libraries (i.e. regex=hadoop*)\n\nWe could make skipChecksum and skipSnapshotsChecksum continue to work for backwards compatbility reasons.",

For the same reason that I am against having license headers easy to skip, I can see it easily leading us down a road to developer sloppiness if this is allowed.\n\nI guess this makes testing an upgrade to a dependency much easier, and there would still be Jenkins builds to enforce the rules.

(eg it's just a local option - you can't make it a default or official jenkins override)\n\nTwo, every developer can make all kinds of optional changes to the build - they can even override the version via sys prop! But they all happen to know that if they change the build params, they can't really expect the official build to pass anymore and if they forget, like other deviations, jenkins will admonish them. ",
