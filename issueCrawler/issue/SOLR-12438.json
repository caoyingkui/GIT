    "description": "In an offline conversation with Jan H\u00f8ydahl we identified the following areas of improvement to the metrics history API in order to increase its user-friendliness and provide more details about its status.\n\u00a0\n\n\tthere are three possible states for the API: inactive (when not in cloud mode), in-memory only (when .system collection doesn\u2019t exist), and persisted when it\u2019s both active and persisted in Solr. The /admin/metrics/history endpoint should give some hint about this status, such as \"mode\":\"memory/index\", \"active\": true|false. Or a separate action=status just to poll status? Currently when the API is inactive it simply returns 404 Not Found.\n\twhen in \"memory\" mode a call to /admin/metrics/history on a non-overseer node should forward the request to the overseer, so that the client does not need to care what mode it is in - kind of like how a query works in distributed mode.\n\tbetter documentation for the API behavior in each mode.\n\tperhaps if mode=memory, there could also be a \"message\":\"Warning, metrics history is not being persisted. Please create the .system collection to start persisting history\"",

When in \"index\" mode the source node is always the one where the request was submitted to.\n\n ",
