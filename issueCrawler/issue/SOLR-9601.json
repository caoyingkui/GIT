    "description": "Solr DIH examples are legacy examples to show how DIH work. However, they include full configurations that may obscure teaching points. This is no longer needed as we have 3 full-blown examples in the configsets. \n\nSpecifically for Tika, the field types definitions were at some point simplified to have less support files in the configuration directory. This, however, means that we now have field definitions that have same names as other examples, but different definitions. \n\nImportantly, Tika does not use most (any?) of those modified definitions. They are there just for completeness. Similarly, the solrconfig.xml includes extract handler even though we are demonstrating a different path of using Tika. Somebody grepping through config files may get confused about what configuration aspects contributes to what experience.\n\nI am planning to significantly simplify configuration and schema of Tika example to *only* show DIH Tika extraction path. It will end-up a very short and focused example.",

So, for ease of testing, I just created it as a separate tika2 core that can be dropped next to the other DIH cores.\n\nI removed all of the unused gunk, so the remaining files are tiny. I wish I could remove the infoStream section, but the default is false and I am not sure I should.\n\nI've also added a prototype-oriented demo of wildcard, renamed and simplified text field definition and did other minor cleanup in what is left.\n\nI am not sure if I need to worry about docValues here. \n\nAlso, I have commented out uniqueKey section, but the corresponding id field definition is missing. But it was missing in the original example too, so I am not sure it is worth adding in the commented out section. \n\nThis is a big change (even if with tiny results files), so I would appreciate people commenting on it before I actually commit it.

The nearest one is resourceName but it is not made available when parsing through DIH, as - I suspect - we abstract the filesystem too well.\n\nI could rename title into id and change type to string but that's a bit too far bending over I think. I could I guess map it to id and copyField to title. Would that be reasonable?\n\nOk on removing infoStream, though we have a logging setting that uses it for all examples globally; but I could add a comment in that file I guess.\n\nsolrconfig.xml already has a long comment about the example being minimalistic.
