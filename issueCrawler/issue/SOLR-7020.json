That way no manual edits to jetty.xml will be required.",

            "content": "Patch against branch_5x implementing the idea.\n\nI chose the name jetty-https-ssl.xml for the alternative jetty config file, to avoid collision with the Jetty 9 changes on trunk (SOLR-4839) that will eventually be backported to branch_5x.  (Trunk has files named jetty-ssl.xml and jetty-https.xml.)\n\nbin/solr start will choose to use jetty-https-ssl.xml instead of the default jetty config file when $SOLR_SSL_OPTS is defined - just like already happens when it chooses the url scheme used to address running instances - so no explicit options are required to choose the SSL jetty config file.
