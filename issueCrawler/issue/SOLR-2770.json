This artifact was part of the 3.3.0 release.  The build system changes under SOLR-2452 are the cause.\n\nDawid Weiss indicated on SOLR-2428 that this Solr-specific jdk1.5-compiled artifact will continue to be required for the remainder of the 3.X release line.",

I mean, if we can't change (add to in this case) a release under this circumstance, then there likely are no circumstances in which an exception would be made to the read-only policy.\n\nI'll work on adjustments to the build to enable properly producing the artifact; we'll need this regardless of the targeted release.
