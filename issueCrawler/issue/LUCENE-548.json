            "content": "It looks like problems could also happen with a MultiSearcher too.\nIn general, don't use sort type AUTO... always explicitly specify how to sort.  Different searchers may come back with different sort types, and then there isn't a good way to merge the results.\n\nThis could probably be fixed in the straight MultiSearcher case by getting the sort type from the first searcher that returns results, and using that for all the other searchers.  Not sure if it's worth the fix though... ",
