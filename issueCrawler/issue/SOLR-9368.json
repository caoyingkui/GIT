    "description": "The documentation for FileDictionaryFactory states that \"Blank lines and lines that start with a '#' are ignored\". This is not the case. When loading a dictionary file with '#' prefixed lines, they just get interpreted as terms and show up in suggestion results. \n\nThis causes additional confusion when trying to use payloads. As stated in https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_1_0/suggest/org/apache/lucene/search/suggest/FileDictionary.html : \"In order to have payload enabled, the first entry has to have a payload\". However, if you happen to have a \"comment\" as the first line in a dictionary file (that doesn't happen to have two instances of the fieldDelimiter in it...), payloads are disabled.",

So the easiest is to treat this as a documentation bug in the RefGuide: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Suggester#Suggester-FileDictionaryFactory and change that.\n\nIf not, this should be changed into a LUCENE issue for code changes, but then it must be a feature request and not a Bug, since the Lucene documentation (Javadoc) is fully in line with the code...
