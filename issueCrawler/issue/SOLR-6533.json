    "description": "There are a bunch of properties in solrconfig.xml which users want to edit. We will attack them first\n\nThese properties will be persisted to a separate file called config.json (or whatever file). Instead of saving in the same format we will have well known properties which users can directly edit\n\n\nupdateHandler.autoCommit.maxDocs\nquery.filterCache.initialSize\n\n   \n\nThe api will be modeled around the bulk schema API\n\n\ncurl http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/config -H 'Content-type:application/json'  -d '{\n\"set-property\" : {\"updateHandler.autoCommit.maxDocs\":5},\n\"unset-property\": \"updateHandler.autoCommit.maxDocs\"\n}'\n\n\n\n\n\n//or use this to set ${mypropname} values\ncurl http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/config -H 'Content-type:application/json'  -d '{\n\"set-user-property\" : {\"mypropname\":\"my_prop_val\"},\n\"unset-user-property\":{\"mypropname\"}\n}'\n\n\n\nThe values stored in the config.json will always take precedence and will be applied after loading solrconfig.xml. \n\n\n\tAn http GET on /config path will give the real config that is applied .\n\tAn http GET of/config/overlay gives out the content of the configOverlay.json\n\t/config/<component-name> gives only the child of the same name from /config . example:  /config/requestHandler , /config/searchComponent",
