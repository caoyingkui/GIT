See patch.\n\nWhen combined with the cache improvements from SOLR-2382 this allows you to join a flat file entity with other entities (sql, etc).",

Should this issue be considered for committing without SOLR-2382, the class could be renamed and included here by itself.  This is the only dependency on SOLR-2382.\n\nThis patch includes unit tests for Delimited & Fixed Width files. "

            "content": "A long time ago someone on the users' list asked for better support for delimited files.  This version supports most of the same features as the CSVRequestHandler, using the same csv parser and most of the same parameter names.  \n\nThe reason for using DIH instead for CSVRequestHandler would be cases where the flat file needs to be joined to other entities, if the data needs to be cached, and/or if transformers need to be applied.\n\nThis patch also retains the same support for fixed-width files.\n\nThe unit tests have been enhanced to test these new possibilities.

This is particularly helpful when joining to SQL data sources as DIH requires the join keys be the same type.  It might be beneficial to rename the enum to \"DIHType\" or something more generic, should either issue become a candidate for commit. "
