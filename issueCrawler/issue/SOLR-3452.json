    "description": "Storing all content in Solr and encoding in base64 binary per solr specification. When using shards to search another core none of the binary is returned properly. It looks like it is returning the address where the binary code is stored. When using Solr to search the primary core for an index, all the binary is returned properly. To test this further, I made the 4 cores share an instance directory, and whenever a shard was search, the binary was not returned properly. There is something happening when the Shard builds and returns search docs, I think that it is failing to decode the encoded byte[]. The returned content always follows the following format: [B:[B@26b8320f \nIt should be noted, only the binary is returned improperly when searching across shards, all other content returns as expected.",
