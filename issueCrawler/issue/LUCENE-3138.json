    "description": "Today IW.addIndexes (both Dir and IR versions) do not check the format of the incoming indexes. Therefore it could add a too old/new index and the app will discover that only later, maybe during commit() or segment merges. We should check that up front and fail fast.\n\nThis issue is relevant only to 4.0 at the moment, which will not support 2.x indexes anymore.",
