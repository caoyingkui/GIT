    "description": "The Ref Guide currently only has a single page with what might be generously called an overview of the v2 API added in 6.5 (https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/v2-api.html) but most of the actual APIs that support the v2 approach do not show an example of using it with the v2 style. A few v2-style APIs are already used as examples, but there's nothing consistent.\n\nWith this issue I'll add API input/output examples throughout the Guide. Just in terms of process, my intention is to have a series of commits to the pages as I work through them so we make incremental progress. I'll start by adding a list of pages/APIs to this issue so the scope of the work is clear.\n\nOnce this is done we can figure out what to do with the V2 API page itself - perhaps it gets archived and replaced with another page that describes Solr's APIs overall; perhaps by then we figure out something else to do with it.",

            "content": "The commits in earlier comments adds V2 API examples to a chunk of pages, specifically:\n\n\n\n\n Page \n Old API endpoint \n\n\nadding-custom-plugins-in-solrcloud-mode.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nbasic-authentication-plugin.adoc \n /admin/authentication \n\n\nblob-store-api.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\nconfig-sets.adoc \n /admin/cores \n\n\ncontent-streams.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\ngetting-started-with-solrcloud.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nmajor-changes-in-solr-7.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nrealtime-get.adoc  \n /<collection>/get or /<core>/get \n\n\nrequestdispatcher-in-solrconfig.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nrunning-solr-on-hdfs.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\ntransforming-and-indexing-custom-json.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\n\n\n\nThe model for these is to use the tab layout approach we added in SOLR-11584. In the HTML pages, these will appear as tabs for users to click on to select the example; in the PDF these will appear sequentially with the same labels that appear in the HTML as the tab labels. A good example of how this looks/works is this page: https://builds.apache.org/view/L/view/Lucene/job/Solr-reference-guide-master/javadoc/transforming-and-indexing-custom-json.html\n\nIn addition to the above list, I made a few other changes to other pages, notably about-this-guide.adoc, to which I added a section to describe what \"V1\" and \"V2\" mean, with a link to further context for the V2 approach. Other changes were mostly typos I noticed as I went along.\n\nSteve Rowe pointed out to me privately that calling the \"old\" way of doing API calls \"V1\" is really a misnomer, but when I started it I couldn't figure out what to call them that was accurate and would be meaningful to people, so in that context it might be the best we can do. He also thought it may be confusing to call the \"new\" way \"V2\" since the path to the new endpoints doesn't include \"v2\", but again, that's what we call it so it's the most apt name I've come up with so far. If someone has a compelling suggestion for an alternative I could pretty easily fix the labels so this doesn't have to be set in stone yet.\n\nI discovered a few pages on my original list that don't really need to updated:\n\n\n\n\n Page \n Old API endpoint \n Notes \n\n\nconfiguring-logging.adoc \n /admin/info/* \n Doesn't accept POST requests to modify \n\n\nfilter-descriptions.adoc \n /<collection>/schema \n POST 'schema/analysis' endpoint not supported in v2 \n\n\nmanaged-resources.adoc \n /<collection>/schema \n POST 'schema/analysis' endpoint not supported in v2 \n\n\ncollections-core-admin.adoc \n /admin/collections \n False positive example \n\n\nlearning-to-rank.adoc \n /<collection>/schema \n Doesn't support v2 yet \n\n\n\n\n\nI probably (quite likely) will not have time to finish the rest of the pages before 7.2 Guide needs to be published, but it wasn't ever my intention to do them all at once anyway (I said it would be a series of commits). I left myself all the hardest ones yet to do. The remaining list of pages to review/update:\n\n\n\n\n Page \n Old API endpoint \n\n\nblob-store-api.adoc \n /.system/blob\n\n\ncollections-api.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\nconfig-api.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nconfigsets-api.adoc \n /admin/configs \n\n\nconfiguring-solrconfig-xml.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\ncoreadmin-api.adoc \n /admin/cores \n\n\nenabling-ssl.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\nimplicit-requesthandlers.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nmaking-and-restoring-backups.adoc \n /admin/cores \n\n\nother-parsers.adoc \n /<collection>/update \n\n\nrequest-parameters-api.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nrule-based-authorization-plugin.adoc \n /admin/authorization \n\n\nrule-based-authorization-plugin.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\nschema-api.adoc \n /<collection>/schema \n\n\nschemaless-mode.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nschemaless-mode.adoc \n /<collection>/schema \n\n\nschemaless-mode.adoc \n /<collection>/update \n\n\nsolr-tutorial.adoc \n /<collection>/config \n\n\nsolr-tutorial.adoc \n /<collection>/schema \n\n\nsolr-tutorial.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\nsolrcloud-autoscaling-api.adoc \n /autoscaling/* \n\n\nsolrcloud-autoscaling-auto-add-replicas.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\nsolrcloud-autoscaling-fault-tolerance.adoc \n /autoscaling/* \n\n\nsolrcloud-autoscaling-overview.adoc \n /admin/collections \n\n\nsolrcloud-autoscaling-overview.adoc \n /autoscaling/* \n\n\nupdating-parts-of-documents.adoc \n /<collection>/update \n\n\nuploading-data-with-index-handlers.adoc \n /<collection>/update \n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, lots of duplicate pages there because I wanted to list out the endpoints that need to be changed. I also missed something in blob-store-api.adoc that I figured out after I'd started my commit, but I'll swing back and do another batch when I have a stretch of time to work on it. ",

Might be worth changing, I'll think about it some more when I get back to this (hopefully soon-ish, but I left the hardest APIs for last so I'm dragging my feet a bit on it). ",
