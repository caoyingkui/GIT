    "description": "Can we add a build option (-Dpendantic=true) that is more anal?\n\nE.g. on backporting a change from trunk (java 8) to 5.x (java 7) I very rarely remember to \"use java 7\" to compile/test.  Sure, we set javac.source/target to 1.7, but that's not perfect (e.g. an interface w/ a default method as of java 8).\n\nWith this option set we could do things like require you are using java 7 on 5.x, fail on warnings, etc.\n\nCasual users/developers can then still use java 8 to run tests, etc. (the option would default to off).",
