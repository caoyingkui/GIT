    "description": "The discussion on SOLR-3358 has many threads, so I will break this out in its own issue.\n\nCurrently we use SLF4j to define logging and the war file distributes the the JUL binding.  To improve the out-of-the-box logging experience, I think we should switch to log4j.  I suggest we:\n\n\tkeep using SLF4J (especially in solrj)\n\treplace the JUL log watcher with a log4j version\n\tthis will let us have the admin UI logging stuff work against a single Appender rather then the root loggers",
