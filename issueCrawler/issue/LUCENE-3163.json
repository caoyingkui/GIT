It really pisses me off when I look at release notes and nothing anchors the releases to dates.  Having to look elsewhere sucks big time.  Release numbers plus relative time between releases contains information that's helpful to people when they decide what release to choose.  You removed useful information.\n\nI'm guessing your motivation, Robert, was to reduce release friction.  I support that motivation.  But I didn't say that the missing date should block the release, so as far as I'm concerned, release friction reduction doesn't cut it as motivation for this change.\n\nI want to put back the release dates.\n\nI'm open to other opinions.

The only thing the dates do is create another thing to update, with no clear benefit to anyone.\nOur goal here is to create open source releases... not maintain a historical record... these dates make releasing harder.\n\nIf we must have dates in CHANGES.txt, then I vote to remove CHANGES.txt completely rather than make releasing so difficult!!!!
