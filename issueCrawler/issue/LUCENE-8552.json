Admittedly this is speculative; may not be worth the bother.",

No new FieldInfos (or FieldInfo) need to be created.   If zero LeafReaders then we can return FieldInfos.EMPTY \u2013 a recent addition.\n\nFieldInfos.Builder takes FieldInfo not FieldInfos; maybe this was a typo on your part.\n\nI propose ignoring the 2nd part of my description concerning equals/hashCode.
