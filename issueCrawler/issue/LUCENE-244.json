Second, the \ntopic_title and msg_body fields are not indexed and thus cannot be searched. Also, a \nquery like \"+a OR b\" is problematic, as the mixing of +/- and AND/OR will only lead to \nconfusion. It seems there are several broken characters in your index. Please look at \nit with Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke/). I'll close the bug report, please open a new \none if you have a reproducible test case of a bug. \n ",
