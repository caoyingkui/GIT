    "description": "Creating this spin off of SOLR-12343 - the fix in that issue addresses the most common cases, but does not help when processEmpty:true is used...\n\n\nin getRefinement() you've got returnedAllBuckets taking into consideration processEmpty:true - so that even if a shardA doesn't say it has more:true we will still send it candidate bucketX for refinement if we didn't explicitly saw bucketX on shardA. so far so good.\n\nbut then, once all the refinement is done, and we have a fully refined bucketX it might now sort \"lower\" then an incomplete bucketY ... and isBucketComplete doesn't pay any attention to processEmpty:true ... so it sees that shardA does not have more:true and thinks (the incomplete) bucketY is ok to return.",
