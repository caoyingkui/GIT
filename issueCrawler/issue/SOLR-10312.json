Needs some final cleaning, comments, formatting. Maybe updating HSQLDB.\n\nA very big discovery was that the implicit lib directory shipped with both Derby and HSQLDB database engines. Why I have no idea, as nothing used Derby and it is rather large. I removed it and everything just keeps on chugging.\n\nI also discovered some messy auto-matching rules when I tried to use dynamicField * combined with SQLEntityProcessor automatic population of fields. It would check for existing fields case sensitive and match dynamicField before pre-defined lowercase field. Not sure if that's a big deal or not, but it is something. ",
