    "description": "Every DOWNNODE command enqueues N copies of itself into queue-work, where N is number of collections affected by the DOWNNODE.\n\nThis rarely matters in practice, because queue-work gets immediately dumped-- however, if anything throws an exception (such as ZK bad version), we don't clear queue-work.  Then the next time through the loop we run the expensive DOWNNODE command potentially hundreds of times.",

That and your patch solve all problems nicely i.e. \n\n\tDOWNNODE creating multiple work queue items\n\tExceptions not clearing work queue\n\tOverseer executing same item twice from work queue and state update queue on an exception\n\n ",

            "content": "On second thought, creating a batch enqueue command is not so straightforward and the callback is called once per enqueue as per the contract of ZkWriteCallback so it is technically not a bug. So I am fine with your solution as it exists. +1 to commit. Please make sure it is backported to the branch_7x and branch_7_0 so that it makes it into the 7.0 release. ",
