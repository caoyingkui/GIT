    "description": "Hey, I got an idea that I'm pretty sure it is not supported.\n\nLet's assume the schema in solr has at least the following fields:\ntransaction_id,\nproduct_id,\ncompany,\nprice\n\nLet's imagine we are Amazon, and we want to analyze the top 10 companies that have sold more than US$ 100,000,000. \nNowadays, the filters are only applied to each solr record and not over aggregated data, so there is no way to achieve this (at least natively) from solr.\nIt is more like a BI Tool capability.\n\nIt would be nice to have this feature in the subfacets module, for example:\ncompanies: {\n  type: terms,\n  field: company,\n  limit: 10,\n  offset: 0,\n  sort: \"price desc\",\n  facet: \n{ price: \"sum(price)\"}\n,\n  aggfilter:\"price > 100,000,000\"\n  }\n}\n\nAnd it would be even better to support logic expressions in the \"aggfilter\" field. For example:\ncompanies: {\n  type: terms,\n  field: company,\n  limit: 10,\n  offset: 0,\n  sort: \"price desc\",\n  facet: \n{ price: \"sum(price)\"}\n,\n  aggfilter:\"price > 100,000,000 OR other_measure < 100\"\n  }\n}",
