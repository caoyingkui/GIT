I dont want such controversy: I care about keeping things stable and bad bugs. I can EASILY see such a warning turning into \"we should change the solr default\" and spinning totally out of control and somehow breaking the example.\n\nI waited extra time for SOLR-6182 because it looked like a really bad bug.
