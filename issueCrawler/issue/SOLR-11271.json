It pulls all tuples from json.facet\n\tI have no idea how to implement all possible aggregations, but it doesn't sounds promising. Is it possible to use one of json.facet classes inside of StreamingExpressions?\n\tjust a note: I suppose even if facet merging is implemented in StreamingExpression, it hardly makes possible to merge 100M facet values from 30 shards, since I tried it with plain Java.\n\n ",
