Then you might\nbe able to figure out when that file was created, modified etc.\n\nDo you ever have two IndexWriters open on the index at once?  Locking should\nmake that impossible, but, if locking is broken (e.g., if you're accessing the\nindex over NFS) or disabled then you might be able to corrupt an index in this way. ",
