    "description": "Forking off discussion in SOLR-6121\n\nBy default, cursorMark requires an unique sort key as not having one can in general can potentially lead to infinite loops of requests. But in cases where the sort key is unique but just not the schema uniqueKey (or in some other usage patterns where an infinite loop is not possible), it would be good to have an expert option which bypasses this check.\n\nBonus: It should be possible to add information to the cookie to detect when things are looping and return an error in such a case. This would make it safe even if this option is specified (at the cost of leaving the error to a later indefinite point when this condition happens depending on the data, so still not preferable as the default).",
