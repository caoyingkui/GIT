    "description": "While working on SOLR-10493 I discovered that the test was failing because a config change had been made. That test goes on to delete collections, but the config change is still sending out reload commands. The sequence is something like this:\n\n1> config change request is made.\n2> call returns, but various core reload commands are still being sent out\n3> collection is deleted\n4> one of the reloads from <2> arrives\n\nTest fails because the core (and descriptor) is gone.\n\nThis was succeeding before SOLR-10007 because (I think) there was a copy of the coreDescriptor being held in several places and one of the un-deleted ones was being used.\n\nIt would be good if there were a way to be sure that that config and schema calls had been propagated to all replicas in all affected collections.",
