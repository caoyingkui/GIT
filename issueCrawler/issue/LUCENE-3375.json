    "description": "If you do a phrase search on a field derived from a fieldtype with the synonym filter which includes a synonym, the term following the synonym vanishes after synonym expansion.\n\ne.g. http://host:port/solr/corename/select/?q=desc:%22xyzzy%20%20bbb%20pot%20of%20gold%22&version=2.2&start=0&rows=10&indent=on&debugQuery=true   (bbb is in the default synonyms file, desc is a \"text\" fieldtype)\n\noutputs\n....\n<str name=\"rawquerystring\">desc:\"xyzzy  bbb pot of gold\"</str>\n<str name=\"querystring\">desc:\"xyzzy  bbb pot of gold\"</str>\n<str name=\"parsedquery\">PhraseQuery(desc:\"xyzzy bbbb 1 bbbb 2 of gold\")</str>\n<str name=\"parsedquery_toString\">desc:\"xyzzy bbbb 1 bbbb 2 of gold\"</str>\n....\n\nYou can also see this behavior using the admin console analysis.jsp\n\nSolr 3.3 behaves properly.",
