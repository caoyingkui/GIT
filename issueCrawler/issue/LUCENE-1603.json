    "description": "This is a patch, that is needed for the MultiTermQuery-rewrite of TrieRange (LUCENE-1602):\n\n\tMake the private members protected, to have access to them from the very special TrieRangeTermEnum\n\tFix a small inconsistency (docFreq() now only returns a value, if a valid term is existing)\n\tImprovement of MultiTermFilter.getDocIdSet to return DocIdSet.EMPTY_DOCIDSET, if the TermEnum is empty (less memory usage) and faster.\n\tAdd the getLastNumberOfTerms() to MultiTermQuery for statistics on different multi term queries and how may terms they affect, using this new functionality, the improvement of TrieRange can be shown (extract from test case there, 10000 docs index, long values):\n\n[junit] Average number of terms during random search on 'field8':\n[junit]  Trie query: 244.2\n[junit]  Classical query: 3136.94\n[junit] Average number of terms during random search on 'field4':\n[junit]  Trie query: 38.3\n[junit]  Classical query: 3018.68\n[junit] Average number of terms during random search on 'field2':\n[junit]  Trie query: 18.04\n[junit]  Classical query: 3539.42\n\n\n\n\n\nAll core tests pass.",

            "content": "This is also another idea. The sum is interesting, too, but not so helpful, if the segments share the same terms. But for the number of seeks in TermDocs its interesting. Even if it sums up, the numbers in the Trie tests are the same, because index is optimized. So the note could be: For real numbers to analyze your query, use a optimized index, for real seek counts on a complex index/query structure, do not optimize.\n\nBy the way: Are queries also rewritten per segment with the new Searchers? If not, one could use the BooleanQuery variant, if he wants to have real term numbers on unoptimized index.\n\nI am +/- 0 about the change. In case of a change, the method should be called getCurrentNumberOfTerms() or something like that \u2013 naming is the hardest one. ",

            "content": "I was thinking that this count is a good way to measure how much net work was done, hence the switch to sum.  EG you could compare that count vs the count you get after having optimized the index to get a sense of how much you gained by optimizing.\n\nWhereas now, with the count only showing the # terms from the last segment searched, is not really useful at all.\n\nAre queries also rewritten per segment with the new Searchers? If not, one could use the BooleanQuery variant, if he wants to have real term numbers on unoptimized index.\n\nThey are rewritten at the MultiReader level, so you're right one could use that to get \"number of unique terms\" vs \"amount of work (seeks) done\".\n\nIf we do change it, ow about \"get/clearTotalNumberOfTerms()\"?
