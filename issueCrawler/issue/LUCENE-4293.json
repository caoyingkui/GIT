    "description": "ArabicRootsAnalyzer is using an index of Arabic terms associated with its roots. each Arabic word has a root. There is no automatic way of deciding the root.\n\nThis Analyzer will match any term with its root, searching/indexing will be based on roots. It gives me great results in my application.\n\nattached all the required files with the db. the problem with it is the size of the db (16MB). number of terms is around 300,000. I have another db with 600,000 but the attached one is summarized and better i believe.",
