At the same time, if we provide an option to not fill fields in LUCENE-1483 (perhaps there is a better way to allow this though), the tie is already there, and its harder to argue against  this (my natural inclination being to not open up things publicly).\n\nIn either case, this should wait for LUCENE-1483 as both the mentioned classes will likely be deprecated.
