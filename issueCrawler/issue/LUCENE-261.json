Without seeing the code and various other things,\nI cannot tell where the problem is.\n\nI can tell you that I use StandardAnalyzer under Jetty, and my memory usage is\nmuch lower, and the application stays up for weeks and processes many more\nqueries.  That's why this report sounds a bit strange to me.\n\nCan you reproduce this problem outside Tomcat, using a stand-alone application\n(class with main())? ",
