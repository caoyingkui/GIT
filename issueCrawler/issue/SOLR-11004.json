    "description": "As Anshum Gupta pointed out in SOLR-10456, the Builder code for each SolrClient has a lot of duplication in it.\n\nFor example, each SolrClient allows configuration of the connection timeout: all 4 builders have a field to store this value, all 4 builders have a withConnectionTimeout method to set this value, and all 4 builders have very similar Javadocs documenting what this value can be used for.\n\nThe same can be said for 5 or 6 other properties common to most/all SolrClient's.\n\nThis duplication could be removed by creating an abstract SolrClientBuilder class, which each of the specific Builders extend.",

            "content": "Patch attached; a few notes:\n\n\n\tall SolrClient Builders now extend SolrClientBuilder\n\twas able to move 4 setters: withHttpClient, withResponseParser, withConnectionTimeout, and withSocketTimeout.  This number will grow pretty quickly though as the SolrClient setters gain Builder equivalent methods (see SOLR-8975)\n\tA naive implementation would have the SolrClientBuilder setters return a SolrClientBuilder reference.  This introduces limitations on the order that setters can be called in.  This appears to be a well documented problem when creating Builders.  So I implemented the solution detailed here, which involves using generics to allow SolrClientBuilder to return a reference typed as the concrete class.\n\n\n\nTests and precommit pass. ",
