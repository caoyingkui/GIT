    "description": "Set the context as IOContext.READ / IOContext.READONCE where applicable\n\n\n\nMotivation:\n\nCustom PostingsFormat may want to check the context on SegmentReadState and branch differently, but for this to work properly the context has to be specified correctly up the stack.\n\nFor example, DirectPostingsFormat only loads postings into memory if the context != MERGE. However a better condition would be context == Context.READ && !context.readOnce.",

Except, the changes in IndexWriter and BufferedDeletesStream are not quite right: because the reader pool may in fact pool (hang onto) the opened SegmentReader, READONCE is not necessarily correct.\n\nIe, a reader may be opened in order to apply deletes, and that caller thinks it will READONCE, but then the pool will hang onto it, and reuse that reader to open an NRT reader, or to do a merge, etc. ",
