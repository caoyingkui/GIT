    "description": "explain plan works as expected on single solr node, After moving to Solr Cloud, it does not show any explanation field in returned documents.\n\nThis is how we ask for explain output in our SolrQuery, as\n\n        SolrQuery sq = new SolrQuery();\n        ........................\n\n        if (args.getExplain()) \n{\n            sq.setParam(CommonParams.DEBUG_QUERY, true);\n            sq.addField(\"explanation:[explain style=text]\");\n        }\n\nI checked the logs at both single node and cloud, but request and its parameters are exactly the same.\n\nIs this a known issue or does it need some other configuration to make it work on solr cloud. We have one main node and one shard and using standalone zookeeper to manage solr cloud.",
