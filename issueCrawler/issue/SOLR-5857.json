    "description": "I have an EnumField called severity.\n\nWhen I run the following query:\nrows=0&q=:&fq=(severity:Critical OR severity:High)&fq=fieldB:[* TO *]&fq=severity:[* TO *]&stats=true&stats.field=fieldB&f.fieldB.stats.facet=severity\n\nI get the following response:\n  <result name=\"response\" numFound=\"1786\" start=\"0\"/>\n  <lst name=\"stats\">\n    <lst name=\"stats_fields\">\n      <lst name=\"fieldB\">\n        <str name=\"min\">Bej</str>\n        <str name=\"max\">dmfbsrvftu</str>\n        <long name=\"count\">1786</long>\n        <long name=\"missing\">0</long>\n        <lst name=\"facets\">\n          <lst name=\"severity\">\n            <lst name=\"`#8;#0;#0;#0;#5;\">\n              <str name=\"min\">Cfo Qbsbejtf )cfoq@be/difdlqpjou/dpn*!</str>\n              <str name=\"max\">Tiblfe Evobz )tiblfee*!</str>\n              <long name=\"count\">24</long>\n              <long name=\"missing\">0</long>\n              <lst name=\"facets\"/>\n            </lst>\n            <lst name=\"`#8;#0;#0;#0;#4;\">\n              <str name=\"min\">Bej Cbcbj )bejc*!</str>\n              <str name=\"max\">dmfbsrvftu</str>\n              <long name=\"count\">1762</long>\n              <long name=\"missing\">0</long>\n              <lst name=\"facets\"/>\n            </lst>\n          </lst>\n        </lst>\n      </lst>\n    </lst>\n  </lst>\n\nAs can be seen, the string representation of severity is invalid  \nSo I concluded there is a bug with displaying statscomponent facet value.\n  I attached a patch fixing the bug. It now returns the proper string   representation of the term.\n  I think StatsComponent facet value should be the Object itself and not the string representation, similar to all other stats values.\n  (For example, If it's an object, the facet field values can be sorted in case the field is a Number or EnumField)\n  I tried to change it, but statscomponent facet value is FieldStatsInfo's name and it gets it from NamedList element's name.\n  If someone can take a look and fix it, I think it will be great. \n\nThanks.",
