    "description": "JDK Logging is clunky at best and hard to configure.  It also does not play nice in web frameworks, since it requires a lot of hacking, or JVM level configuration.\n\nCommons-logging provides a mechanism for supporting several logging frameworks, so users can choose the appropriate logging mechanism.  Additionally, we are already using commons-logging in SolrJ.\n\nPatch to follow that converts Solr code to commons-logging.",

The jar file can be grabbed from clients/solrj/lib and put in ./lib.\n\nlogging.jsp has been mostly commented out and replaced with \"FIX ME\" or TODO comments.\n\nOtherwise, all tests pass and I did click around the Admin as well and it seems good.\n\nPatch also does an \"Optimize Imports\" on all source files, to remove stagnant imports for Loggers, etc. "
