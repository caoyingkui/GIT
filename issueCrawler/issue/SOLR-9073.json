I've had trouble getting things to work quite right though, mostly because I'm still trying to allow an old style, no core, conf layout to use as well as the new internally required one named core layout.\n\nThat's trickier than I thought it would be apparently. The hack I used in SOLR-9076 that gets around this is to simply submit something with both config layouts, but that is not a possible real solution. So we probably just have to work through whatever issues we need to to accept both layouts properly.\n\nIt sounds easy - if we see the old layout, just make a core folder and turn it into the new layout for internal use. Despite that, I hit some thorny issues last time I tried to fix this. ",
