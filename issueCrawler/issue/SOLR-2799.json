I don't have time to update the patch at this moment but the file has moved to /lucene/dev/trunk/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/cloud/CloudState.java.  Having done a quick diff on that file vs the version that I am working with they are identical.  I've updated the patch to point at the new directory "
