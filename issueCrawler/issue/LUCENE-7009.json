    "description": "In junit5, a neat assertion method is added which makes testing expected\nfailures a little more straightforward. The block of code that is\nexpected to throw is passed in with a lambda expression, and the caught\nexception returned for inspection. The usage looks something like this:\n\n\nIOException e = expectThrows(IOException.class, () -> {\n    throw new IOException(\"some io error\");\n});\n// assert stuff here about the exception\n\n\n\nWe should add this to LuceneTestCase until junit5 is available.",
