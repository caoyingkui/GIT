And in many cases the queries coming in to Solr will be different from and less interesting than the queries entered in the User's search application. That's perhaps why most people implement search analytics logging on the application level (their web front end) instead of at solr-level. ",

            "content": "With latest Solr's default configurations, overrides, property sets, etc, the only place the real query is known is deep within the bowls of Solr after everything is resolved. And it is logged in some fashion if appropriate TRACE is enabled.\n\nAnd if that's enabled, the output goes to the log, which is displayed in the Admin UI.\n\nSo, I think there is not much for the Admin UI specifically here.\n\nWhat would be nice is to have somehow a debugging component that will log a final query in a way that shows all the layers contributing to it. But that would be a very different JIRA.\n\nThis one, I believe, can be closed. ",
