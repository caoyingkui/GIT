I think someone who doesnt understand what tokenizers and filters do, likely isnt looking at their log files either.\n\nIn my opinion, Solr should be more picky about its configuration. Often times if i havent had enough sleep i will type tokenFilter instead of filter, and it simply ignores it completely, instead of an error.\n\nand i can't be the only one that does this, its not obvious that tokenizer = Tokenizer, charFilter = CharFilter, analyzer = Analyzer, but filter = TokenFilter.

Users rarely see/do something about the warnings.\n\nI think this would be a good service to those users who trip the hard error on upgrade: it means Solr is not doing what they thought they asked it to do.
