            "content": "it ocured to me last night that instead of just dealing explicitly with indexConfig here, we could probably help improve the validation of a lot of config parsing with a relatively simple change to Config.getNode: throw an error in any case where Solr is looking for a single Node/String/Int/Boolean and multiple values are found instead.\n\nI wasn't sure how badly this might break things, but i've been testing it out today and except for a few cases where the text() xpath expression was getting abused (instead of a simple node check), it seems fairly straight forward.\n\nSo here's a patch that broadens the scope of the issue to fail hard if any \"single valued\" config option is found more then once in the config.
