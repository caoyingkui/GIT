    "description": "In multicore scenario, if I have \".\" in instance directory name - it is not able to find it in solr UI or even not able to ping it due to which I'm not able to get the statistics regarding that particular index like last modified time etc..\n\nExample:\n\nTry giving an instance directory name as \"vempap.public.message\" - you can see the core loaded in the UI, but when you click on it - it says \"vempap.public.message\" Not Found .. I spent a lot of time debugging & now, when I just replace \".\" with \"_\" - it works fine & well..\n\nPlease let me know if it is intended to be like that or it is a bug. Sorry it is already mentioned earlier - couldn't find related bug when I did a quick search.",
