Currently, all other response writers(JSON and XML at least) return non-stored docvalue true field if specified explicitly with fl=(i.e, fl=,non_stored_doc_field). Without the new public API in ReturnFields I couldn't find a better way to handle this in CSV response writer. Also, to handle SOLR-7414 I was thinking of using this. Other than these cases I can't think of any other cases where this Public API would be required.
