    "description": "Thinking about alternative approaches to the problem outlined in SOLR-2010, it occurs to me that there are many cases where it would be useful to be able to control copyField behavior rather than having to fully populate or omit document fields.  In regards to spellcheck, I could then have a few different spellcheck indexes each built from a different field  and indicate for each document whether it's text should be added to each of the different spellcheck fields.\n\nI'm imagining a general syntax like this:\n\n\n <copyField source=\"body\" dest=\"teaser\" maxChars=\"300\" controlField=\"populate_teaser\"/>\n\n\n\nIf not sure if Solr would could use the value of a control field only matches the \"ignored\" field type, but that's what I'm thinking about as one possibility.  In other words, I can pass index-time flags into the document that are reflected in the terms of what's indexed but not explicitly stored in the document.",
