    "description": "It looks like the intention in ChaosMonkey is that, unless explicitly set, it should randomly cause session expiration and connection loss:\n\n    if (EXP != null) {\n      expireSessions = EXP; \n    } else {\n      expireSessions = chaosRandom.nextBoolean();\n    }\n    if (CONN_LOSS != null) {\n      causeConnectionLoss = CONN_LOSS;\n    } else {\n      causeConnectionLoss = chaosRandom.nextBoolean();\n    }\n\n\nbut EXP and CONN_LOSS are defined as:\n\n  private static final Boolean CONN_LOSS = Boolean.valueOf(System.getProperty(\"solr.tests.cloud.cm.connloss\", null));\nprivate static final Boolean EXP = Boolean.valueOf(System.getProperty(\"solr.tests.cloud.cm.exp\", null));\n\n\nWhich makes them \"false\" (not null) unless those properties are set. \nThe fix is trivial, but we should see how it affects our tests before submitting",

I think at the time the tests did not beast fully though and so I didn't want to add any new complications before fixing the current issues. AFAIK, they are in a lot better shape now, but we would want to beast well before enabling this stuff. ",
