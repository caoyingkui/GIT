    "description": "Upgrade ICU4J to the latest version - 50.1.1 at the moment.\n\nDictionaryBasedBreakIterator was eliminated by the upgrade, so some very small code changes were required.  All tests (including nightly and weekly) passed with patch.  I did not try running tests multiple times.  The branch_4x tests were run on Windows, where I run eclipse.  The trunk tests were run on Linux, the platform where I actually use Solr.\n\nI have no idea whether the ICU tests are comprehensive enough to detect problems with version upgrades.\n\nIt is possible that I don't have enough knowledge to complete this upgrade properly.  I did my best.\n\nA couple of javadocs mentioned the removed class.  I changed one (hopefully correctly), but didn't know what the other should say.",
