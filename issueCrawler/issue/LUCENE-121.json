    "description": "When I use an Anaylizer with the PorterStemFilter for indexing \nand the same Anaylizer  for searching, I am unable to find stemmed words.\nExample: I have a document with the word \"running\" or the\nword \"values\".  I think it is getting indexed correctly ( \"ing\" and \"es\"\nbeing removed), however when I enter the same word in the search \"values\", \nfor example, it is not found.  But, if I then enter \"valu\" as a search\nparameter, it is found.   So, I am guessing that the stemming is not\nbeing done by the QueryParser.  Also, I have the same problem with the\nGermanStemFilter as well.",
