    "description": "Starting from solr 7.2 there is stream.body with default false, but you can configure it via solrconfig.xml except one case - EmbeddedSolrServer. In this case SolrRequestParsers always got null instead of solr core config. That means you can't configure some parameters in case of EmbeddedSolrServer.\n\npublic EmbeddedSolrServer(CoreContainer coreContainer, String coreName) {\n  if (coreContainer == null) {\n    throw new NullPointerException(\"CoreContainer instance required\");\n  }\n  if (Strings.isNullOrEmpty(coreName))\n    throw new SolrException(SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR, \"Core name cannot be empty\");\n  this.coreContainer = coreContainer;\n  this.coreName = coreName;\n  _parser = new SolrRequestParsers(null);\n}\n\n\u00a0\n Here is a pull request - https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/340\u00a0, with some basic tests.",
