I've been considering adding a new \"norms\" field at document level for a couple of years now. 8 more bits at document level would allow for moving general document boosting to move it out the norms-boost-per-field-blob and increase the length normalization and per field boost resolution quite a bit at a low cost. \n\n(I hope that is not yet another can of worms I get to open.)

Karl have you tested that?  EG using\nfunction queries you could easily emulate \"per-document norms\". ",
