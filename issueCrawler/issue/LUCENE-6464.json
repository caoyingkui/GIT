    "description": "This is an enhancement to LUCENE-6050 \nLUCENE-6050 added\n\nlookup(CharSequence key, Map<BytesRef, BooleanClause.Occur> contextInfo, int num, boolean allTermsRequired, boolean doHighlight)\n\n\nwhich allowed to do something like\n\n(A OR B AND C OR D ...)\n\nIn our use-case, we realise that we need grouping i.e\n(A OR B) AND (C OR D) AND (...)\n\nIn other words, we need the intersection of multiple contexts.\n\nThe attached patch allows to pass in a varargs of map, each one representing the each group. Looks a bit heavy IMHO.\n\nThis is an initial patch.\n\nThe question to Michael McCandless and jane chang is:\nis it better to expose a FilteredQuery/Query and let the user build their own query instead of passing a map?\n\nExposing a filteredQuery will probably give the best flexibility to the end-users.",

            "content": "Please, have you also noticed the TODO\n\nOh I missed that, thanks for pointing it out.\n\nMaybe we should fix the lowest level lookup method to do this \"all MUST_NOT\" check?  I.e., it would handle taking the clauses of the sub-query and moving them up to the main query?  This is also cleaner for users, i.e. they should not be expected to know about this \"all MUST_NOT\" case.  And then toQuery doesn't need to handle it ...\n\nAnyway, I think the : should be better (faster) than doing context:, because :* doesn't visit any postings.  Also, the user may not have indexed any contexts ... "
