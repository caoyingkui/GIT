Can you take a look and see if it made it through the transformations OK?\n\nAnd any Git people out there; is there magic to make Git produce a SVN-compatibile patch? Seems like a good addition to the \"How to contribute\" page, lots of people seem to be using Git...\n\nBeyond that, I'll run the tests with it and report back if there's a problem.
