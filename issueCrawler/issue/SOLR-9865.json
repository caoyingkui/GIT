    "description": "Maybe I'm missing something, but I was just looking at RestoreCore and see that in some failure cases it removes the index properties file to roll back to the existing index. But as far as I know, you could have index index.timestamp1, index.timestamp2 and deleting that file would roll you back to index instead of index.timestamp1.\n\nIn SOLR-9859, I'm wondering if we should automatically find the latest index directory if no index.properties file exists, which I guess could be a solution here too if done right.",
