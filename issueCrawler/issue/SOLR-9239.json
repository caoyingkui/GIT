    "description": "In SOLR-5750 we added core backup/restore hooks via the core admin API . This was done at the time to leverage the backup/restore code from the cloud classes . A discussion on why we have two ways for core backup/restore came up in SOLR-7374 . \n\nCurrently we document core backup/restore only via the replication handler. I think we should move in favour of it being a core admin operations. Here are some of the reasons why I think thats a good idea :\n\n\tSolrCloud backup/restore is implemented as a collection api. The logical equivalent of it for standalone should be core admin and not replication handler .\n\tMore importantly core admin supports async calls. So using the backup/restore api will be a lot cleaner. We don't need a separate backup/ restore status API .",
