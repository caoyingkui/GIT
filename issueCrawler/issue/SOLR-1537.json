    "description": "Allows sharded search results to dedupe results by ID based on either the order of the shards in the shards param or by score.  Allows the result returned to be deterministic.  If by shards then shards that appear first in the shards param have a higher precedence than shards that appear later.  If by score then higher scores beat out lower scores.  This doesn't allow multiple duplicates because currently SOLR only permits a single result by ID to be returned.",

            "content": "That is correct.  Dupes is when more than one shard returns a values for the same uniqueKey.  Removal of dupes is by uniqueKey deterministically by either order of shards or by highest score.  Before there was no way to determine which dupe would show up because it was based on whichever shard returned first from the query broadcast to multiple shards.  In other words the fastest responding shard would give the first uniqueKey value and the rest with that uniqueKey would be ignored.  Fastest though could change between query requests. "

This patch also supercedes SOLR-1143 bringing all unit tests up to date and adding enhanced functionality to allow returning partial results when servers names are mispelled or there are other errors besides simple connection errors.  Headers have been added to show the number of shards failing and the names of those shards.  Unit test have been added to demonstrate dedup of search results by shard order.  This patch passes all current unit tests. "
