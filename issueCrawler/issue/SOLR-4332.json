    "description": "In SOLR-4321, it's documented that creating a collection via API results in some nodes having more than one core, while other nodes have zero cores.\n\nNot sure if this is desired behavior, but when a node doesn't know about a core, it throws a 404 on select/update.\n\nReproduction:\n-Create a 2 node SolrCloud cluster\n-Create a new collection with numShards=1. 50% of your cluster will have a core for that collection.\n-Do an update or select against the node that doesn't have the core. 404\n\nLike I said, not sure if this is desired behavior, but I would expect a cluster of nodes to be able to forward requests appropriately to nodes that have a core for the collection.",

            "content": "It's not necessarily desired behavior, but it is known behavior. We have talked about having a core act as a scatter-gather core in this case - and I've even played around along those lines once. Never finished it though - one tricky issue to deal with is if there are no cores...so should we just create a tmp core to do the search? \n\nIt's basically in the future improvement bucket. Patches welcome though. "
