            "content": "I've attached a patch with the changes I propose to make for this.  Here's the list of what I did:\n\n\n\tNew file named major-changes-in-solr-7.adoc, will be a child of solr-upgrade-notes.adoc (which is itself a child of getting-started.adoc). Includes major changes in Solr 7, including new features + deprecations, removals, etc.\n\tMoved major-changes-from-solr-5-to-solr-6.adoc to also be a child of solr-upgrade-notes.adoc\n\tEdited solr-upgrade-notes.adoc\n\t\n\t\tMoved list of changes for 6.x releases that was on solr-upgrade-notes.adoc to the end of major-changes-in-solr-7.adoc, as a semi-comprehensive list of major changes people might want to know about between 6.0 and 6.6.\n\t\tUntil 7.1 and further 7.x releases, pointed people looking at solr-upgrade-notes.adoc to major-changes-in-solr-7.adoc for detailed info about what they might expect when upgrading from whatever 6.x version to 7.0. My expectation is after 7.0 (for a 7.1 release, etc.) we'll go back to putting major changes on solr-upgrade-notes.adoc until it's time to do a major page for 8.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nThis is a bit of a departure from the way we've done this in the past, but hopefully it's easier for users.\n\nI'm also toying with the idea of reinstating the \"Major Changes from Solr 4 to Solr 5\" page...but have not convinced myself it's worth the hassle it would entail trying to wring it out of Confluence's archive.
