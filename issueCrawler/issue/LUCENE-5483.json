    "description": "I added a lot of tests and greatly refined this algorithm to match correct hunspell behavior. there were many bugs:\n\n\n\trecursionLimit was a hack: this is actually specified by the dictionary to be twofold suffix + one prefix, or if COMPLEXPREFIXES is specified, twofold prefix + one suffix. This patch removes cursion limit\n\trecursion didn't work correctly: it didnt validate multi-level continuation classes correctly.\n\tadd COMPLEXPREFIXES support.\n\tprobably other minor bugs fixed in the process.\n\n\n\nI validated all testing against hunspell",
