It seems now that close always calls rollback, but we shouldn't really count on that so I have changed things to assume that either may or may not call the other and SolrIndexWriter will still properly clean up.

You can close an IndexWriter with either rollback or close and one of those might internally call the other - so the CLOSE_LOCK just makes sure the SolrIndexWriter close logic happens once. We don't use the this lock just so that we don't end up conflicting with other uses.\n\n2) In DirectUpdateHandler2 why the change from writer.shutdown() to writer.close()? All the other changes go in the other direction, e.g. close -> shutdown.\n\nBecause shutdown will wait for merges and commit, etc and DirectUpdateHandler2 actually does that right above - optionally - it was actually a small bug that someone changed it to shutdown (that's just on branch 5x though). We didn't want to commit in all cases like shutdown was doing. \n\nI do see a problem though - we need to call waitForMerges before we close. "

Waiting for merges can take a long time - perhaps we should just bail on them on shutdown - you don't lose data from that. Or perhaps we should wait when we commit on shutdown and not when we don't.\n\nI almost favor not waiting in either case - when I want to shutdown, I want it to be fairly prompt. Perhaps it should be a configuration and default to off. I don't want to tie all that into this issue though. We should probably just wait for merges for now as I think it's been done for a long time. "
