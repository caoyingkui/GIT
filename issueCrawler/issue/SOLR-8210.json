The menu doesn't scroll though, meaning the only way to get to these entries is to use another screen, or change the text size in the browser temporarily.",

            "content": "Upayavira there is a function check_fixed_menu that tries to handle that:\n\n\ncheck_fixed_menu = function check_fixed_menu()\n{\n  $( '#wrapper' ).toggleClass(\n    'scroll', \n    $( window ).height() < $( '#menu-wrapper' ).height() + $( '#header' ).height() + 40\n  );\n}\n\n\nThe idea would be: check the height of the (browser)window and compare it to the height of the menu (wrapper) to decide if the menu could be a sticky one (that is what that kind of menu is typically called) or should scroll with the remaining content because there is not enough space on the screen.\n\ncheck_fixed_menu gets called once the application starts as well as on window.resize to catch up if the user resizes the browser window, in which case it might change either way (become sticky or not sticky anymore) ",
