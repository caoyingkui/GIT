    "description": "Result Grouping is a very useful feature: we can use it to find duplicate data in index, but it lacks of one feature-group.mincount. \n\nWith group.mincount, we can specify that only groups that has equal or more than ${mincount} for the group field will be returned.\n\nSpecially, we can use group.mincount=2 to only return duplicate data.\nCould we add this in future release? Thanks.",
