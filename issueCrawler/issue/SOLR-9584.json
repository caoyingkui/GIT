I think there are valid comments, that the handling of the routing should happen outside solr, but for me this is an argument, that the urls should be relative, because this allows any outer application to do this. Otherwise you force that solr is allways installed in hostname:port/solr/ and could not be hostname:port/<mypath>/solr/  ",
