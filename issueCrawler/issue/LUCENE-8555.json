    "description": "Instead of rewriting into a BooleanQuery, LatLonShapeBoundingBoxQuery should handle dateline crossing support directly in the IntersectVisitor. This feature issue will add support for splitting a LatLonShapeBoundingBoxQuery into an east and west box and comparing the indexed LatLonShape fields against each. INTERSECTS, DISJOINT, and WITHIN will all be handled by the LatLonShapeQuery IntersectVisitor.",
