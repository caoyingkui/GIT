            "content": "\nThe root cause of the AIOOBE is that when a doc is found in the UpdateLog, the RTG component explicitly passes -1 to DocTransformer.transform(), and currently ValueSourceAugmenter.transform() doesn't account for this possibility when using it's IndexReader to lookup the FunctionValues for the document.\n\nObviously, even if it did do some sanity checking for negative docids, that wouldn't really address the root of the problem \u2013 getting usable FunctionValues.\n\nThe RTG Component already has a code path where it sometimes uses ulog.openRealtimeSearcher() when doc are found in the update log, instead of returning the document directly from the ulog command \u2013 but that code path is currently confined to situations where fq params are included in the RTG request (so it can evaluate them against the Realtime Searcher to ensure the doc should really be returned)\n\n\n\nI'm attaching a straw man patch that:\n\n\n\trefactors the ulog.openRealtimeSearcher() logic in RTG Component to also apply when there are transformers\n\tAdds a new light weight (private) RTGResultContext class for wrapping realtime {{SolrIndexSearcher}}s for use with transformers.\n\tFixes ValueSourceAugmenter.setContext to use ResultContext.getSearcher() instead of the one that comes from the request\n\t\n\t\tIndependent of anything else, this seems like a bug (it certainly violates the javadocs of ResultContext.getRequest(), even if it was getting the same SolrQueryRequest via a more round about way)\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThis patch fixes all existing @AwaitsFix(SOLR-9285) tests, and doesn't seem to cause any new test failures in the code base, but i don't think we should commit it as is for the simple reason that it seems like it is overkill: Simple transformers like RenameFieldTransformer can operate just fine on docs from the UpdateLog w/o any need for a (realtime) SolrIndexSearcher.\n\nAs noted in the patch with a nocommit I think what would be best is to enahnce this patch by adding a boolean needsSolrIndexSearcher() method to the DocTransformer API, which defaults to false but any transformers like ValueSourceAugmenter that actually need access to a SolrIndexSearcher in their setContext method could ask for it, and the code in this patch that sets mustUseRealtimeSearcher = true anytime there is a transformer could be modified to instead use transformer.needsSolrIndexSearcher()\n\nQuestions/comments/concerns?\n\n\n\nReviewing the RTG Component code also makes me realize that in general we should have more RTG+transformer tests which:\n\n\n\tuse fq params\n\task for uncommited ids both immediately after adding them (before a realtime searcher may have been opened) AND \"after\" a realtime searcher has been opened (for whatever reason)\n\task for multiple ids in a single request (to ensure nothing broken in the looping logic)\n\t\n\t\tmixing commited, uncommited, and uncommited but in an already re-opened realtime searcher\n\t\tmixing them in various orders, since that affects when a realtime searcher might be opened\n\t\n\t\n\n\n ",
