    "description": "Currently we are using the ant task (http://sourceforge.net/p/jtidy/code/1261/tree/trunk/jtidy/src/main/java/org/w3c/tidy/ant/JTidyTask.java) built into jtidy itself.\n\nThis has a number of disadvantages:\n\n\tat least in the version we are using, creates a ByteArrayDataOutput that hides all the output. So if there is an error, its no good.\n\trequires creation of a temp directory: even though we disable the actual output with a parameter, this means it creates thousands of 0 byte files\n\n\n\nWe only pass 3 options to tidy today:\n\n\tinput-encoding=UTF-8\n\tonly-errors=true\n\tshow-warnings=false <-- this one is a OOM hack.\n\n\n\nIdeally i think we would:\n\n\tpass input-encoding=UTF-8, only-errors=true, quiet=true.\n\tsend all output to a single file or property.\n\tif this contains any contents, fail and print the contents.\n\n\n\nThis would mean we would fail on warnings too (I checked, this is a good thing, there would be some things to fix).\nSo as a start we could just set show-warnings=false temporarily so we only fail on errors like today.",
