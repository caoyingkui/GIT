    "description": "The proposed feature is to accept a URL parameter when using extract-only mode to specify an output format.  This parameter might just overload the existing \"ext.extract.only\" so that one can optionally specify a format, e.g. false|true|xml|text  where true and xml give the same response (i.e. xml remains the default)\n\nI had been assuming that I could choose among possible tika output\nformats when using the extracting request handler in extract-only mode\nas if from the CLI with the tika jar:\n\n   -x or --xml        Output XHTML content (default)\n   -h or --html       Output HTML content\n   -t or --text       Output plain text content\n   -m or --metadata   Output only metadata\n\nHowever, looking at the docs and source, it seems that only the xml\noption is available (hard-coded) in ExtractingDocumentLoader.java\n\nserializer = new XMLSerializer(writer, new OutputFormat(\"XML\", \"UTF-8\", true));\n\n\n\nProviding at least a plain-text response seems to work if you change the serializer to a TextSerializer (org.apache.xml.serialize.TextSerializer).",
