    "description": "I'm testing out a multi-server cluster in Amazon EC2 with a dedicated stand alone zookeeper. When I terminate one of the nodes, the cloud UI and zookeeper retains the information. It shows it as grey, but it never removes it from the list.\n\nI understand why this may be for setups that have hard coded machine addresses, but in EC2 I would end up with dead sessions that have no hope of ever being brought back to life. If I spin up instances based on demand, I'll end up with a lot of dead sessions.",
