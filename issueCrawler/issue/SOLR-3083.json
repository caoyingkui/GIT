    "description": "When trying to monitor our Solr instances with JMXtrans (https://github.com/lookfirst/jmxtrans), we discovered that all the Mbeans were identifying themselves as java.lang.String.   This breaks the GangliaWriter in JMXtrans because the software decides it's a string instead of a numeric values and you can't graph a string.   Other software we are monitoring with JMXtrans (e.g. Kafka) correctly identify their numeric values as numbers (doubles in this case).\n\nFor example, avgTimePerRequest in Solr is identified as a string which makes no sense.  This behavior makes Solr less interoperable with the rest of the Java ecosystem.\n\nThe problem code is in JmxMonitoredMap.java\n\nNamedList dynamicStats = infoBean.getStatistics();\nif (dynamicStats != null) {\n  for (int i = 0; i < dynamicStats.size(); i++) \n{\n    String name = dynamicStats.getName(i);\n    if (!staticStats.contains(name))\n      attrInfoList.add(new MBeanAttributeInfo(dynamicStats.getName(i),\n              String.class.getName(), null, true, false, false));\n  }\n\nI will try to attach a screenshot. \n\nThanks for Solr!  We use the heck out of it, it's awesome.",

Looks like that attribute is actually calculated into a String and so would have to be fixed by itself.  I'm not sure if this is still present in the latest builds though. "
