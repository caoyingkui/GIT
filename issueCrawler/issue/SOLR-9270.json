    "description": "The spatialContextFactory attribute (sometimes set on RPT field) is interpreted by a Spatial4j SpatialContextFactory and is expected to be a class name.  In the Solr adapter, for ease of use, it would be nice to accept simply \"JTS\".\n\nFurthermore the older value in 5x should be accepted with a logged warning.  That would make upgrading easier.",

            "content": "This patch file adds a \"JTS\" alias, and it also rewrites any attribute value containing \"com.spatial4j.core\" with \"org.locationtech.spatial4j\".  The spatialContextFactory isn't the only attribute this applies to, there are some others: https://locationtech.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/com/spatial4j/core/context/SpatialContextFactory.html\n\nThere is no test as I don't want to bring in a JTS dependency.  I tested manually, and observed the expected warnings when the old class name is referenced.\n\nI'll commit this Friday.  I plan to retroactively include a note in the CHANGES.txt under 6.0 migrating mentioning the change in package name and that going to 6.2 may be easier due to this change.  I'll also update the ref guide. ",
