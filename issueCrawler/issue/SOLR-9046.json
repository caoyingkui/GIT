    "description": "The Windows solr.cmd script makes the (incorrect) assumption that Solr will always be listening on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces). When you change the interface\naddress, say to 127.0.0.1, then the status and stop commands will fail.\n\nThis patch adds a property in solr.in.cmd, which is passed to SOLR_OPTS as -Djetty.host, and replaces the instances of 0.0.0.0 in solr.cmd.\n\nThe patch includes some changes in the netstat logic used in solr.cmd to find the correct Solr process(es). \n\nTested on Solr 5.5 on Windows 7 and 10. \n\nNote: Untested on Solr 6. Currently using Solr 5.5",

There are two thing that might not work - I am checking this, too:\n\n\tIt assumes that JETTY_HOST is an ip address. You can always also give a hostname. It should be documented in the new solr.cmd.in, that you have to use an IP address\n\tIt might not work with IPv6. As I am working in an IPv6 environment - IPv4 works, but is not preferred here anymore, I will report on bugs, too.\n\n ",
