As a workaround you can put the jar into <instance dir>/lib\n\nIt doesn't work for at least two reasons:\n1) The instance dir is added twice: once in initLibs, and another time in addToClassLoader\n2) When I fixed this, I found out that the filtering class for addToClassLoader doesn't work properly.\n\nA rough fix is as follows, but it, probably, can't make use of Solr variables such as solr.solr.home. This is code changed in initLibs, I commented out incorrect lines:\n\n\n        } else if (null != path) {\n          //final File file = FileUtils.resolvePath(new File(loader.getInstanceDir()), path);\n          final File file = new File(path);\n          loader.addToClassLoader(file.getParent(), new FileFilter() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean accept(File pathname) {\n              //return pathname.equals(file);\n              return true;\n            }\n          }, false);",
