    "description": "When a core starts up as part of a collection, and it's not a shard leader, it goes into recovery, part of which involves a 7 second wait (set in SOLR-7141) to ensure that updates being sent from the leader don't get missed in between buffering and replication.\n\nThis has the unfortunate side-effect of adding a 7-second pause to collection creation whenever the replication factor is 2 or more, which slows down tests massively - for example, DeleteReplicaTest takes about 54 seconds to execute on my machine, 28 seconds of which is just pauses - over 50% of execution time.  It's not actually possible to add documents to a collection before the creation request has returned, so the recovery stage here isn't strictly speaking necessary.  \n\nI think we could try adding a parameter to a CoreAdmin create request that says the core is being created as part of a new collection, so it doesn't need to try and recover from it's leader when it starts up.  Does this sound sensible, or am I missing something here?",
