    "description": "When searching across multiple shards with HTTP caching enabled, the Caching related headers (ETag, Cache-Control, Last-Modified)  in the response are based on the \"index\" of the coordinating solr core, and are not influenced by the properties of the shards. For example, take the query\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/core1/select/?q=google&shards=localhost:8983/solr/core2,localhost:8983/solr/core3\n\nETag should be calculated off of core2 and core3, instead it's being calculated from the index of core1.\n\nThis results in index modificaitons to to core2 or core3 being \"invisible\" to clients which query this URL using \"If-None-Match\" or \"If-Modified-Since\" type requests",
