This creates problems when trying to switch the logging implementation. \n\n1. org.apache.solr.core.ZkContainer\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/core/ZkContainer.java#L218\n\nI don't know the impact of this change, but shouldn't this call `org.apache.solr.logging.MDCLoggingContext.clear()` ?\n\n2. org.apache.solr.handler.component.RangeFacetProcessor and org.apache.solr.handler.component.RangeFacetRequest\n\nshould use slf4j instead of log4j\n\nI had a stab at it at\n\nhttps://github.com/oschrenk/lucene-solr/commit/025b4802caf0360c63a3554af82e9ed4c94ff5a3#diff-7d822e8ff8ff21d88437652bbc894739R28",

            "content": "We should certainly fix problems like this.\n\nAll is not lost even without the fixes, though:  If you're switching logging implementations, you should be adding the slf4j jar to intercept log4j calls and direct them through slf4j \u2013 log4j-over-slf4j-X.Y.Z.jar \u2013 and removing the actual log4j jar.  Some of Solr's dependencies (zookeeper being a prime example) use log4j directly. ",

Shai Erera - is this okay?\n\tThe usage inside SolrCLI was only because it changed log levels for ZK and solrj to reduce noise. On Timothy Potter's suggestion, I set the log levels inside solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/log4j.properties instead of code. Also the default log level for org.apache.zookeeper is changed to WARN instead of ERROR. This is because if ZK is not running, the ZK client retries a few times and this activity is logged in WARN. If we set the log level to ERROR then the zkcli script just hangs for a while (more than a minute).\n\n ",
