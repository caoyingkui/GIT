    "description": "Phrase queries with leading stopwords exhibit inconsistent behavior. For example, the phrase query \"the president of the united states\" matches \"hello president of the united states\", but not \"president of the united states\".\n\nAs far as I can tell, this issue arose in 4.0 when ExactPhraseScorer was re-implemented. In 3.0, \"the president of the united states\" matches both \"hello president of the united states\" and \"president of the united states\".\n\nA test case that triggers the bug is attached.",
