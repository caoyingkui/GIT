    "description": "IndexReaders are able to perform certain write operations on an index (setNorm(), deleteDocument()). This makes issues like LUCENE-743 more complicated and also duplicate code for acquiring locks and write transactions is necessary.\n\nTherefore we should make IndexReaders \"read-only\" in the future. However, we have to find a good solution to support setting norms and deleting documents by docid with the IndexWriter. See related discussions in LUCENE-743 and http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/52017.",
