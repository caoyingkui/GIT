    "description": "Spinoff from here:\n\n  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1095\n\nI think for 3.0 we should change the default so that:\n\n\n\tBy default, StopFilter increments the positionIncrement whenever\n    it skips stop words.  Add option to revert back to old way.  This is\n    just toggling the boolean default.\n\n\n\n\n\tBy default, when QueryParser adds terms to a PhraseQuery it should\n    include the position reported by the analyzer.  Add option to\n    revert back to old way.\n\n\n\nI'm just opening this now, marking as 3.0 fix, to remind us all to\nactually fix it for 3.0.",
