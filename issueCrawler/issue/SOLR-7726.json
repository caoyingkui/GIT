    "description": "During the SolrCore#initCodec initialization phase, it initializes the the CodecFactory by using ResourceLoader#newInstance, which will call inform(SolrCore), and then a few lines later it calls inform again.  The SchemaCodecFactory, for example, does not break due to this because it has no effect to inform it multiple times.  But any extensions or other CodecFactories may need to work around this by checking for a second inform call to prevent errors or just from running potentially complex init code twice.",
