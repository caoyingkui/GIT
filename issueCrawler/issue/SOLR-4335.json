    "description": "If you include illegal XML characters like U+FFFF in document in an UpdateRequest, they cause an error on the server.\n\n\njava.lang.RuntimeException: [was class java.io.CharConversionException] Invalid UTF-8 character 0xffff at char #1940, byte #127)\n\n\n\nOther Illegal XML characters are replaced by the code in org.apache.solr.common.util.XML. For instance U+0000 is replaced with \"#0;\". SolrJ should be consistent in how it handles illegal XML characters.\n\nFrom the source code it looks like this issue affects the most recent versions of Solr, but I did not attempted to reproduce on 4.0.",
