    "description": "We have a SolrCloud with Solr version 4.7 with Tomcat 7. And our solr index(cores) are big(50~100G) each core. \n\nWhen we start up tomcat, the solr webapp deployment is very slow. From tomcat's catalina log, every time it takes about 10 minutes to get deployed. After we analyzing java core dump, we notice it's because the loading process cannot finish until the MBean calculation for large index is done.\n\nSo we tried to remove the <jmx/> from solrconfig.xml, after that, the loading of solr webapp only take about 1 minute. So we can sure the MBean calculation for large index is the root cause.\n\nCould you please point me if there is any async way to do statistic monitoring without <jmx/> in solrconfig.xml, or let it do calculation after the deployment? Thanks!\n\nThe callstack.png file in the attachment is the call stack of the long blocking thread which is doing statistics calculation.\n\nThe catalina log of tomcat:\nINFO: Starting Servlet Engine: Apache Tomcat/7.0.54\nOct 13, 2014 2:00:29 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployWAR\nINFO: Deploying web application archive /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/solr.war\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:23 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployWAR\nINFO: Deployment of web application archive /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/solr.war has finished in 594,325 ms <---------------- Time taken for solr app Deployment is about 10 minutes -----------\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:23 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deploying web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/manager\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:26 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deployment of web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/manager has finished in 2,035 ms\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:26 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deploying web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/examples\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:27 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deployment of web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/examples has finished in 1,789 ms\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:27 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deploying web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/docs\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:28 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deployment of web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/docs has finished in 1,037 ms\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:28 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deploying web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/ROOT\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:29 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deployment of web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/ROOT has finished in 948 ms\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:29 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deploying web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/host-manager\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:30 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory\nINFO: Deployment of web application directory /opt/ibm/solrsearch/tomcat/webapps/host-manager has finished in 951 ms\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:31 AM org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol start\nINFO: Starting ProtocolHandler [\"http-bio-8080\"]\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:31 AM org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol start\nINFO: Starting ProtocolHandler [\"ajp-bio-8009\"]\nOct 13, 2014 2:10:31 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina start\nINFO: Server startup in 601506 ms",
