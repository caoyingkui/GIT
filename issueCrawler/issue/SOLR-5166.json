    "description": "I'd like to propose the idea of weighted load balancing in SolrCloud. The main need for this capability is for cases where a node is expected to be slower than others. Some examples: you're running a DIH import on 1 node, 1 node has less resources, etc.\n\nI feel static weights that can be modified online would cover most use cases, but there could be neat possibilities with dynamic weights based on metrics, an idea brought up by Mark Miller on the solr-users thread where this was quickly discussed: SolrCloud Load Balancer \"weight\".",
