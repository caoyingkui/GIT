            "content": "Here is a patch. It reserves an additional bit in the header to say whether the encoding should be \"inversed\" (meaning clean words are actually 0xFF instead of 0x00).\n\nIt should reduce the amount of memory required to build and store dense sets. In spite of this change, compression ratios remain the same for sparse sets.\n\nFor random dense sets, I observed compression ratios of 87% when the load factor is 90% and 20% when the load factor is 99% (vs. 100% before).

This would really simplify LUCENE-5101. ",
