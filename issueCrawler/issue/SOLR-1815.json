    "description": "Using Solrj, I wanted to sort the response of a range query based on some specific labels. For instance, using the query:\n\n\nfacet=true\n&facet.query={!key= Less than 100}[* TO 99]\n&facet.query={!key=100 - 200}[100 TO 200]\n&facet.query={!key=200 +}[201 TO *]\n\n\n\nI wanted to display the response in the following order:\n\n\nLess than 100 (x)\n100 - 200 (y)\n201 + (z)\n\n\n\nindependently on the values of x, y, z which are the numbers of the retrieved documents for each range.\n\nWhile Solr itself produces correctly the desired order (as specified in my query), SolrJ doesn't preserve it. \n\nRE: Yonik, a solution could be just to change\n\n_facetQuery = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\n    ...to...\n_facetQuery = new Linked HashMap<String, Integer>();",

I really can't think of a realistic reason why not. "
