    "description": "Uwe Schindler noticed what looked like a memory leak caused by the addition of SOLR-1972.  I don't believe it's actually a leak, but the additional memory required does appear to be causing problems for Solr test JVMs.  I think this is likely because there are a LOT of request handlers defined for even a very minimal test config, each of which ends up with the new objects.\n\nThis is an attempt to provide an option for turning on the new statistics only when required.  For most people, this will only be required for search handlers.\n\nIf this is not successful at fixing the test problems, we can remove metrics with this issue.",

I have a new idea \u2013 make RequestHandlerBase implement Closeable and add a call to close() everywhere that a handler should be destroyed.  If this issue is considered a good idea, I will do so as part of the new approach in SOLR-1972. "
