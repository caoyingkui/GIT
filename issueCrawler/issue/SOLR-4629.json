            "content": "\nAfter adding a lot of debug logs, and walking through the results of lots of failed tests compared to successful tests, and a lot of vigorous, physical consultation between my forehead and my desk i think i've finally tracked down the cause of all the \"expected 2 got 3\" failures from checkForSingleIndex.\n\nThe problem in a nutshell is one of concurrency. When the test thread makes a request to the master or to the slave those requests are handled by a jetty thread which (via SolrDispatchFilter) creates a SolrQueryRequest, which has a searcher ref, which has a Directory ref.  When the request is done, the SolrQueryRequest is closed, hich releases the searcher ref, which releases the directory ref \u2013 but by the time this happens, the response has already been returned to the \"client\" (the test thread), and the test thread may enter checkForSingleIndex to acquire the lock on the CacheDirectoryFactory (to check the list of cached paths) before the resources from a previos rquest have been completely released \u2013 so the test fails because an Directory from an old request still hasn't been released.\n\nExample...\n\n\nTime   Test-Thread              Jetty-Thread-N\n0      http request->jetty\n1                               accept http request\n2                               create solr query request\n3                               incref searcher, incref dir\n4                               process solr query request\n5                               test thread<-write http response\n6      process response\n7      ...    \n8      assert(2=num dirs)\n9                               decref seracher, decref dir, release dir\n\n\n\nI think the key change is to modify checkForSingleIndex so that instead of asserting exactly 2 paths in the cache, we assert that there are only 2 paths that are not \"done\" \u2013 allowing for the possibility of other paths still being tracked because of requests still being closed.\n\n\nThe attached patch makes this change \u2013 there are still some nocommits (in particular i completely commented out hte replication core reloading to rule that out as a possible cause, but there's also some excessively absurd logging) but even if you ignore all that, after replacing \"CachingDirectoryFactory.getPaths()\" with \"CachingDirectoryFactory.getLivePaths()\" I have yet to see \"expected:<2> but was:<3>\" in any test run.  If you tweak that method to eliminate the \"!val.doneWithDir\" dir check, you should start seeing the failures come back.\n\nI'll clean the patch up more tomorow and run some more exhaustive tests to be sure i haven't broken anything, but i wanted to post what i had in case i got hit by a buss (and to ensure Mark Miller doesn't see any flaw with my \"getLivePaths()\" change before i get too happy about it)\n "
