    "description": "The following schema config (adding postingsFormat) produces no changes in Solr's behavior.  If postingsFormat=\"BloomFilter\" is instead added to a new fieldType and that fieldType is used, then Solr's behavior changes.  In my pre-deployment tests, it results in SOLR-3950.\n\n<field name=\"did\" type=\"long\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" postingsFormat=\"BloomFilter\"/>\n\nHaving to add a new fieldType for an alternate codec leads to configuration duplication and the potential for confusing problems.  I would imagine that most people that are interested in alternate codecs will want to continue using an existing type.",
