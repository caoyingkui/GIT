I don't currently have a large enough index to test this.\n\nI will wait for a manual test by Murali (who reported this issue), and for at least one patch review. ",

            "content": "Previous patch apparently did not fix the bug - a casting problem in RAMOutputStream had to be fixed. \nUpdated patch adds a test imitating ramFile larger than maxint. \nFor this had to make the allocation of a new byte array in RAMFile overridable. \nThe new test fails before fixing RAMOutputStream (affecting RAMDirectory constructor from FS). However the issues in RAMInputStream in fact do not cause failures, yet they should be fixed. \n\nWith a test in place I now feel confident in this fix - will commit it in a day or two if there are no reservations.
