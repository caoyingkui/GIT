    "description": "Today maxShardsPerNode helps users ensure multiple replicas of the same shard don't get assigned to the same node.\n\nStarting 7.0 , the policy framework can express the same constraint.\n\nBoth can conflict today.\n\nIf a user creates a collection with maxShardsPerNode=1 here's the equivalent of it in the policy framework.\n\n\n{\"replica\": \"<2\", \"shard\": \"#EACH\", \"node\": \"#ANY\"}\n\n\n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/solrcloud-autoscaling-policy-preferences.html#limit-replica-placement\n\nWe should also change the default of maxShardsPerNode from 1 to -1 so that it doesn't fail commands when a user doesn't specify this parameter.",
