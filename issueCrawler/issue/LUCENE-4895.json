    "description": "The \"IsDisjointTo\" SpatialOperation is not implemented for RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy and some/all others. It has been very low priority because it is simply the inverse of \"Intersects\" which is universally implemented on the SpatialStrategy implementations.  \n\n\n\tShould spatial \"disjoint\" count documents that have no spatial data?\n\tArguably, there should be one implementation amongst the SpatialStrategies implemented in terms of \"Intersects\"; this way each strategy need not deal with it.",

So I'll do these things tomorrow. ",

That testing is what triggered my discovery of two spatial bugs I recently reported & fixed.\n\nI plan to commit this in a couple days. ",
