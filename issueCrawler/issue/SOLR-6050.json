    "description": "Make it easy to initialize (with a hyperlink) the Solr Admin UI query page with a given Solr query, to make \u201cOpen this query in Solr Admin Query UI\u201d links.\n\nIt is already partly possible to link to the Solr Admin UI query page with parameters to initialize the form fields, e.g.:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/#/mycore/query?q=foo&fq=bar:baz\n\nBut this support is pretty limited. Main limitations:\n\n1. Repeated parameters (e.g. fq=foo:bar&fq=baz:xyzzy) don't work. Workaround: convert them to a single parameter with + in front of each filter: fq=%21foo%3Abar%20%21baz%3Axyzzy \u2014 but of course that workaround yields a less convenient setup in the query page. Also doesn't work for all repeated fields, e.g. facet.field=foo%20baz is not valid in a Solr query.\n\n2. feature-enabling checkboxes don't get checked (e.g. by facet=on and hl=on)\n\n3. Field-specific overrides (e.g. f.cat_id.facet.limit=37) are not captured \u2014 these could be placed in \u201cRaw Query Parameters\u201d",
