    "description": "It would be really cool if we could have a QueryComponent that enabled doing aggregating calculations on search results similar to what the StatsComponent does, but in a more generic way.\n\nI also think it makes sense to reuse some of the function query capabilities (like the parser, etc.).\n\nI imagine the interface might look like:\n\nmath=true&func=recip(sum(A))\n\n\n\nThis would calculate the reciprocal of the sum of the values in the field A.  Then, you could do go across fields, too\n\nmath=true&func=recip(sum(A, B, C))\n\n\nWhich would  sum the values across fields A, B and C.\n\nIt is important to make the functions pluggable and reusable.  Might be also nice to see if we can share the core calculations between function queries and this capability such that if someone adds a new aggregating function, it can also be used as a new Function query.\nOf course, we'd want plugin functions, too, so that people can plugin their own functions.  After this is implemented, I think StatsComponent becomes a derivative of the new MathComponent.",
