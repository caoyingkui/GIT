    "description": "Currently TokenFilterFactories etc, tend to load their resources via ResourceLoader.  This requires Factories to know the name of the resources and inhibits testing since resources must exist as actual files that the ResourceLoader can load.  We should detach the Factories from ResourceLoader by supporting resource injection into Factories through setters.\n\nThis will have an additional benefit of making it clearer what resources a Factory needs.",
