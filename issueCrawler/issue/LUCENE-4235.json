    "description": "Back in Lucene 2.9, I hardcoded NRQ to always use filter rewrite based on the precisionStep. This is bogus and contradicts our autodetection (which may need some overhaul now in Lucene 4.0).\n\nIf a query rewrites to only one term, using filter rewrite is stupid and slows down a lot, it can do a simple CSQ(TermQuery()) which is incredibly fast.\n\nThis issue will remove the line from the CTOR.",
