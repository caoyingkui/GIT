    "description": "LUCENE-6508 removed support for unlockOnStartup, but the way the changes are made are inconsistent with how other config options have been deprecated in the past, and cause a confusing error message if an index is locked on startup...\n\n\n\tin 5x, the SolrConfig constructor should log a warning if the unlockOnStartup option is specified (regardless of whether it's true or false) so users know they need to cleanup their configs and change their expectations (even if they never get - or have not yet gotten - a lock problem)\n\n\n\n\n\tin SolrCore, the LockObtainFailedException that is thrown if the index is locked should not say \"Solr now longer supports forceful unlocking via 'unlockOnStartup'\"\n\t\n\t\tbesides the no/now typo, this wording missleads users into thinking that the LockObtainFailedException error is in some way related to that config option \u2013 creating an implication that using that option lead them to this error.  we shouldn't mention that here.",

            "content": "In any case, the error message should be very rare.\n\nBTW, It's impossible to ever need to unlock the directory in the default config (NIOFSLockFactory), because the JVM / OS kernel cleans up the lock on JVM exit. SO the message does not need to be so prominent. In the default config, if directory is locked you have a second Solr instance somewhere running. Poeple using HDFS may need more instructions how to remove the lock! SimpleFSLockFactory is something nobody should use at all (maybe only with NFS), so this is also not a problematic thing. ",
