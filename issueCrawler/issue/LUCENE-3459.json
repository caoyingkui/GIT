    "description": "ChainedFilter also uses OpenBitSet(DISI) at the moment. It should also be changed to use FixedBitSet. There are two issues:\n\n\tIt exposes sometimes OpenBitSetDISI to it's public API - we should remove those methods like in BooleanFilter and break backwards\n\tIt allows a XOR operation. This is not yet supported by FixedBitSet, but it's easy to add (like for BooleanFilter). On the other hand, this XOR operation is bogus, as it may mark documents in the BitSet that are deleted, breaking new features like applying Filters down-low (LUCENE-1536). We should remove the XOR operation maybe or force it to use IR.validDocs() (trunk) or IR.isDeleted()",

            "content": "Ha!  I was just about to report the reverse problem \u2013 make TermsFilter return OpenBitset for optimal compatibility with ChainedFilter.  I'm using TermsFilters with ChainedFilter and the mis-match of OpenBitSet and FixedBitSet is definitely not optimal since I want it to intersect those bitsets together quickly.\n\nI don't understand why there are both.  My IDE says FixedBitSet has 206 usages compared to OpenBitSet's 230.  That's closer than I thought.  I recall Uwe Schindler saying he would like OBS deprecated, but I pointed out that it is OBS that is fully public and FixedBitSet that is marked as @lucene.internal. ",

ChainedFilter needs some additional bit operations, FixedBitSet currently does not support.\n\nPerformance-wise FixedBitSet is better for filters because it has less checks and does not support resize (the bit set size is fixed).
