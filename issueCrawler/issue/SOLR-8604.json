    "description": "The MLT query parser performs a realtime get to fetch document by id if it is specified. As realtime get works only within a specific collection, so does MLT. If collection parameter is supplied, it should be used both in MLT qparser and realtime get to fetch the document in any collection, and to use it for similarity in the case of MLT.",

Adding unit tests.\n\nThe original patch for Solr 5 contained also some partial support for SOLR-7913, which made it difficult to integrate and test individually.  This patch for Solr 6.6 contains only support for the \"collection\" query parameter in RealTimeGetComponent and CloudMLTQParser.\n\nAlso tested locally on a sample Solr with 2 collections: alias is supported, but not in unit tests.
