I did the precommit on Linux, though \u2013 I don't have all the prerequisites for that build target on my Windows machine. ",

They are all gone now.\n\nWhile I was there, I cleaned up some additional warnings in the source files that use commons-cli.  I'd appreciate a review to tell me if I have overstepped in any way.\n\nI'm running tests now (on Windows) and will do a precommit and nightly-smoke (on Linux) when/if that successfully completes.  I will also do some manual testing of the bin\\solr.cmd script to make sure that the arguments aren't completely broken. ",
