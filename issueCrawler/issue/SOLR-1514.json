    "description": "Hi,\nin my Jmeter  ATs  I can see that under some circumstances facet search results contain '0' both as keys\nand values for the integer field called 'year' although I never index zeros. \n\nWhen I do a normal search, I don't see any indexed fields with zeros. \n\nWhen I run my facet test (using JMeter) in isolation, everything works fine. It happens only when it's being run after other tests\n(and other indexing/deleting). On the other hand it shouldn't be the case that other indexing are influencing this test, as at the end of each test I'm deleting\nindexed documents so before running the facet test an index is empty.\n\nMy facet test looks as follows:\n 1. Index group of documents\n 2. Perform search on facets\n 3. Remove documents from the index.\n\nThe results that I'm getting for an integer field 'year':\n\n 1990:4\n 1995:4\n 0:0\n 1991:0\n 1992:0\n 1993:0\n 1994:0\n 1996:0\n 1997:0\n 1998:0\n\nI'm indexing only values 1990-1999, so there certainly shouldn't be any '0'  as keys in the result set.\n\nThe indexed is being optimized not after each document deletion from and index, but only when an index is loaded/unloaded, so the optimization won't solve the problem in this case. \nIf the facet.mincount>0 is provided, then  I'm not getting 0:0, but other entries with '0' values are gone as well:\n\n1990:4\n1995:4\n\nI'm also indexing text fields, but I don't see a similar situation in this case. This bug only happens for integer fields.",
