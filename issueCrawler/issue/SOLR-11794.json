    "description": "UPDATE\nPULL replica replication stops after calling the RELOAD collection API, even without any config/schema changes!\nIt's also happening when schema API is used to add a new field.\n\n\nAn operating SolrCloud with NRT, TLOG, and PULL replicas.\nSolr - 7.1.0\nZK - 3.4.10\n\nUsed config set - sample_techproducts_configs\nShards - 1\n\nWhenever a schema change (adding of new fields/changing field types) is pushed to ZK and the collection is reloaded using\n/solr/admin/collections?action=RELOAD&name=sample, the index changes stop replicating to PULL replicas. NRT and TLOG are able to replicate the index.\n\nBefore the schema change, I can see the indexFetcher thread running on PULL replica\n2017-12-26 10:17:11.802 INFO  (indexFetcher-14-thread-1) [c:sample s:shard1 r:core_node6 x:sample_shard1_replica_p5] o.a.s.h.IndexFetcher Master's generation: 2\n2017-12-26 10:17:11.802 INFO  (indexFetcher-14-thread-1) [c:sample s:shard1 r:core_node6 x:sample_shard1_replica_p5] o.a.s.h.IndexFetcher Master's version: 1514283298419\n2017-12-26 10:17:11.802 INFO  (indexFetcher-14-thread-1) [c:sample s:shard1 r:core_node6 x:sample_shard1_replica_p5] o.a.s.h.IndexFetcher Slave's generation: 2\n2017-12-26 10:17:11.802 INFO  (indexFetcher-14-thread-1) [c:sample s:shard1 r:core_node6 x:sample_shard1_replica_p5] o.a.s.h.IndexFetcher Slave's version: 1514283298419\n2017-12-26 10:17:11.802 INFO  (indexFetcher-14-thread-1) [c:sample s:shard1 r:core_node6 x:sample_shard1_replica_p5] o.a.s.h.IndexFetcher Slave in sync with master.\n\nAfter that, the following change in schema that is made to managed-schema of sample_techproducts_configs, pushed to ZK, and collection reloaded.\n<field name=\"testpoint_1\" type=\"point\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\n<field name=\"testpoint_2\" type=\"point\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\n<field name=\"testpoint_3\" type=\"point\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\n\nI can no longer see IndexFetcher thread running on PULL replica. No logs are printed. The logs end with the collection reload log\n2017-12-26 10:22:09.256 INFO  (qtp128526626-16) [c:sample s:shard1 r:core_node6 x:sample_shard1_replica_p5] o.a.s.s.HttpSolrCall [admin] webapp=null path=/admin/cores params=\n{core=sample_shard1_replica_p5&qt=/admin/cores&action=RELOAD&wt=javabin&version=2}\n status=0 QTime=624\n\nThe index is never modified after this, and leader doesn't get the polls from the PULL replica.\n\nObservations:\n\n\tManually forcing an index fetch using /replication?command=fetchindex syncs the index, but doesn't start the IndexFetcher polling.\n\tRestarting the replica will sync the index, starts IndexFetcher thread and polling.\n\tRemoving and adding the replica back as PULL will sync the index, starts IndexFetcher thread and polling.",
