    "description": "This is a continuation of LUCENE-6908 which validates USGS accuracy of 0.5% for Sinnott haversine distance calculation. The issue also introduced a space segmentation approach for BKD distance queries near the poles. In LUCENE-6956 a restriction on distance size was initially removed to randomly test BKD distance queries at any range. This revealed an issue where distance error nearly doubles for exotic rectangles created by BKD's split algorithm. This issue will investigate potential distance error caused by the segmentation approach introduced in the second part of LUCENE-6908.",
