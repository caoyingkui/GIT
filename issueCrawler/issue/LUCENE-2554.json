    "description": "The surrogate dance in the preflex codec (which must dynamically remap terms from UTF16 order to unicode code point order) is buggy.\n\nTo better test it, I want to add a test-only codec, preflexrw, that is able to write indices in the pre-flex format.  Then we should also fix tests to randomly pick codecs (including preflexrw) so we better test all of our codecs.",

The new random test (TestSurrogates) is good at finding bugs there...\n\nThe hack I have to forcefully use the test-only preflexrw codec needs to be made more generic, so that we can randomly pick the default codec to use for each test.
