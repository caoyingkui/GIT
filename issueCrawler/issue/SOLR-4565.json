The only difference is that you must skip some rules for Nynorsk if you have configured the stemmer to only use Bokm\u00e5l.\n\nBoth Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l have endings with \"-ene\", for instance many feminine indefinite nouns in plural form such as \"jentene\" (same for both languages). For these nouns, you must only exclude stemming for words ending with \"-ane\" if you have configured it for Bokm\u00e5l.\n\nThe same rules apply to masculine indefinite nouns in plural form for Nynorsk, i.e. endings with \"-ar\". The stemmer must skip those endings as long as only Bokm\u00e5l is used. "

I will try to explain below.\n\nFor backward-compatibility, only Bokm\u00e5l should be used if no variant is defined. Therefore, the useBokMaal method will also return true if there are no variants defined. The same applies if \"no\" is set as a variant. This means that both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l are set, and thus, useBokmaal should return true as well. I encapsulated this into methods for readability reasons. "
