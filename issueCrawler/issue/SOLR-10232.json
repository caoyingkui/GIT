    "description": "This is probably a fairly straight forward extension of our Logistic Regression on text capabilities. The main idea is to predict numeric outcomes based on text. Examples:\n\n\n\tpredict salary based on a text in a resume.\n\tpredict age of author based on text of document.\n\tpredict number of clicks based on text in an article.\n\tpredict number of sales based on product description.\n\tpredict the number of prior art listed based on the text of the patent.",
