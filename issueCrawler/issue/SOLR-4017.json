    "description": "At present, signatures for deduplication are constructed from the raw text of a specified set of fields. This means they may not take advantage of the normalization provided by Analyzers: stripping of HTML, tokenization, diacritic normalization, stemming or stop-removal, etc. It would also allow a token-based signature like the TextProfileSignature to consider character or token ngrams where appropriate.\n\nInstead of handling this task with a special SignatureUpdateProcessorFactory, it seems one could do (almost) the same with CloneFieldUpdateProcessorFactory, and the appropriate *SignatureAnalyzer which outputs a single (or indeed, multiple!) Term: a hash. (I am not familiar enough to know whether the overwriteDupes option would require a further UpdateProcessor.)\n\nThe current approach may be more efficient for most cases, so could be retained for efficiency compatibility.",
