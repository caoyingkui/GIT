    "description": "Now that points have a getDocCount statistic, we could optimize execution of range queries in the case that the range's lower bound is less that the field's min value and the range's upper bound is greater than the field's max value.\n\nI would expect such an optimization to kick in frequently for users who store time series in their indices as it is quite frequent for ranges to cover entire segments or even entire indices.",
