    "description": "I've observed major numDocs inconsistencies between leader and follower in SolrCloud running on HDFS during bulk indexing jobs from Hive.\n\nSee attached screenshots which show the leader/follower relationships and screenshots of the core UI showing the huge numDocs discrepancies of 20k vs 193k docs.\n\nThis initially seemed related to SOLR-4260, except that was supposed to be fixed several versions ago and this is running on HDFS which may be the difference.\n\nHari Sekhon\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/harisekhon",
