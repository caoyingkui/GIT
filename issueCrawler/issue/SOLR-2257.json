            "content": "This is actually a bug! Thanks for finding this Shai.\n\nThe problem is the comparators used in spellcheck are broken: this doesn't just affect the DirectSpellChecker but also the PlainText and Index-based spellchecks.\n\nFor example, if you use the SuggestWordScoreComparator (i think this one is the default), it first sorts based on score, then on document frequency if there is a tie. but if both of these are a tie the results are undefined... it depends on things such as which order you added documents to your index (for the index-based case)!!!!\n\nThis patch adds a tertiary tie-breaker, which is guaranteed to make the result stable, by using term text (String.compareTo) in these situations.\n "
