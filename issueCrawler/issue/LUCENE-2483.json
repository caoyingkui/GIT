    "description": "Spinoff of LUCENE-2380.\n\nNow, when you load the terms index (FC.getTermsIndex), it loads two\narrays, ord (maps docID -> ord) and lookup (maps ord -> term).\n\nBut sometimes you don't need the lookup map (and, it's often very\ncostly in RAM usage, much moreso than the ord map).\n\nEG if your index is a single segment, and your app doesn't need the\nvalues (LUCENE-2335).\n\nOr, if you use a sort comparator that resolves ord -> term and v/v (eg\nusing terms dict).\n\nSo we should make it optional...\n\nAlso, similarly, we could merge getTerms/getTermsIndex.  It's\ndangerous today if you load terms and then termsIndex because you're\nwasting tons of RAM; it'd be nicer if we could have a single cache\nentry that'd \"upgrade\" itself to be an index (have the ords).  This\nsingle entry could then serve ords, ords+terms, or just terms.",
