Meanwhile, AJAX solr (a solrjs fork) has made good progress and seems that it will be supported moving forward.  \n\nWe should archive solrjs and remove it from the source tree.\n\nFor discussion, see:\nhttp://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/900bf257f8df4e37/archive_solrjs_and_point_to_ajax_solr#13f6cb2ec40ae1f0",
