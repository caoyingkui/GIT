When I was copying from the example, which included copying the included jetty and creating an init script for it, I looked at the three extra html files, which ARE included there.\n\nI figured since they were \"-extra\" they were not necessary.  I did look into their actual content and found it useless, so I didn't copy them to my installation.  That's when I ran into the stacktrace - the 20 cores I had when I first set it up (deriving from my 3.x config) produced sixty of these huge log entries, even when logging at WARN.  Now I have 16 cores on the server and my workaround has eliminated the error.\n\nIf a fix for this issue were implemented (using log.warn()) and I deleted the empty html files, I would end up with 48 consecutive single log line entries if I left logging at WARN.  If the logging were at INFO (which I believe is the default), they would probably be scattered throughout the log and not make much difference in its size.  That's actually a good argument for making the message log at info and not warn. "

Solr has never been about providing a user-facing interface, the admin UI is a dev tool.\n\nI'd (grudgingly) go along with hardening the code to never log an error if these files aren't found, but inserting some junk like \"if (filename == admin-extras.html) don't log\" is really ugly in the code. All to make up for something that, IMO, shouldn't be there in the first place.\n\nFWIW\nErick "

While your patch completely removes the admin-extra UI feature, and eliminates the exceptions when using the UI \u2013 it doesn't address  the underlying issue: ShowFileRequestHandler shouldn't log a big loud ugly stack trace for the understandable error of a 404 \"file not found\"\n\nThis new patch fixes the remaining code paths in ShowFileREquestHandler to \"return\" the 404 exception instead of throwing it and includes tests for this \u2013 which should be done regardless of anything else.  It also leaves the admin-extra functionality in place, since it's no longer noisy if the files 404.\n\nDoes any one actually object to leaving this admin-extras functionality in place with this fix?

Just because I don't have a use for it right now doesn't mean that I won't in the future - it would make it a lot easier to hand off some admin responsibilities to untrained personnel if I could put docs and links for common tasks right in the UI.\n\nI filed the issue to eliminate the incredible noise in the logs.  Looking at the patch, I can't tell what happens in the log.  I'll test it later when I have a free moment.  IMHO it ought to be logged at INFO, but WARN would be understandable too.  Thanks! "
