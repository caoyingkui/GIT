SpecialOperations.getFiniteStrings today returns null when it hits the limit, yet, it has accumulated the first N strings it saw at that point, so maybe we should change it to return the first N so that we have something to build?\n\nOr alternatively, AnalyzingSuggester could just skip a given input if it created too many strings.
