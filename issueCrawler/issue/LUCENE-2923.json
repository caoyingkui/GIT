Optimizing is with recent Lucene versions not needed anymore. It's hard to explain to people, so example code and books should never tell to optimize. In books about lucene there should also be an explanation when optimizing is needed or usefully, put prevent people from always doing this. ",

(Especially the Maven part, where I completely guessed!).\n\nI skimmed the patch and can see that you removed the specializations of the dist-maven task in both modules/benchmark/ and lucene/contrib/demo/.  For benchmark, the specialization was trivial and didn't change any behavior, so I assume that's why you dropped it.  In the demo case, the specialization was introduced to be able to deploy the .war file, but since the .war file is no longer produced, the dist-maven specialization is no longer required.  Later today I'll have time to apply the patch and do sanity checking on the maven outputs.\n\nOne thing left to do (I can handle this separately): change the Maven POMs for the benchmark and demo modules.
