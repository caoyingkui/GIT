            "content": "Here is a WIP patch that extracts out three strategies into a (temporarily named) new Assign2 class. A builder is used to create an assignment request. A factory class creates the right strategy based on request and collection parameters. Still more work needs to be done:\n\n\tSeparate maxShardsPerNode handling from getNodesForNewReplicas method\n\tCombine the identifyNodes and getNodesForNewReplicas methods\n\tCut over all API classes to call the combined method instead of deciding strategy themselves\n\n ",

The ref guide[1] says:\n\nAlso, if maxShardsPerNode is specified during the time of collection creation, then both maxShardsPerNode and the policy rules must be satisfied.\n\n\nThis means that the current behavior is a bug which I already fixed in the refactoring. I only need to fix the test to set a large maxShardsPerNode (or -1 indicating unlimited).\n\n[1] - https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_4/solrcloud-autoscaling-policy-preferences.html ",

I kept it separate to avoid adding more code into AddReplicaCmd (it is already pretty complex). ",
