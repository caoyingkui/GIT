A little more testing added and it fell down.\n\nLatest patch reverses the QEC comparator, uses reverse=true for the QEC sort fields and doesn't require the distributedProcess part.\n\nThere is still a problem in the the QEC sort field used is 'id' - this causes a problem with distrib. If you change it to something like \"elevate\" that solves the distrib problem - but then some of the single node tests fail.\n\nFor now its left at 'id' and sorting by id in distrib with QEC is not supported iwth this patch.
