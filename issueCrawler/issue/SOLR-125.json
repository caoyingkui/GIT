            "content": "Preliminary patch attached.\n\nGeneral approach: NamedList needs to get off the fence and say if order or access-by-key is more important.\n\nStarting with the assumption that NamedList==ordered, I subclassed it to create a SimpleOrderedMap.\nThis has the advantage of not having to change any method signatures anywhere since a SimpleOrderedMap is a NamedList.  It also keeps order for clients who can maintain order, and is much more efficient than something like the alternative: LinkedHashMap.\n\nXML output will be unchanged.\n\nJSON (and friends) output will be a map (JSON object) for SimpleOrderedMap, or (by default) a \"flat\" array, alternating key and value.  The json.nl param can be used to change this default for NamedLists.\n\nMost instances of \"new NamedList()\" should be changed to SimpleOrderedMap.  Items that are sorted, where order is more important (like field facets) should continue to use NamedList. "
