    "description": "When doing a file search in the eclipse project built with \"ant eclipse\", the eclipse-build directory gets searched.  This results in about twice as many files being searched, so it takes about twice as long as it should.  I would expect eclipse to automatically skip that directory because it knows that directory is its own build target, but it doesn't seem that eclipse is that smart.",

Normally I would avoid fixing problems like that because it can make life difficult for others, but this is a file that sees very little churn, so I see it as pretty safe.\n\nI haven't yet figured out how to exclude \"search.log\" from the search ... this file seems to be pretty big on my system, so it takes a long time to search.  I tried filtering it in the same place as the eclipse-build directory, but that didn't do it. ",
