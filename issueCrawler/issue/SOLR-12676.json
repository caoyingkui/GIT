After creating that the model was created as expected. \n\nTo recreate this:\n\ncurl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{\n  \"store\" : \"myStore\",\n  \"name\" : \"myModel\",\n  \"class\" : \"org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LinearModel\",\n  \"features\" : [{\n    \"name\" : \"nonExistentFeature\"\n  }],\n  \"params\" : {\n    \"nonExistentFeature\" : 1.0\n  }\n}' http://localhost:8983/solr/$CORE/schema/model-store",
