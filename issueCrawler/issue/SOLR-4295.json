    "description": "Since the parameter names for field-specific faceting parameters are a little odd, such as \"f.field_name.facet.prefix\", the SolrQuery class should have methods that take a \"field\" parameter. The SolrQuery.setFacetPrefix() method already takes such a parameter. It would be great if the rest of the setFacet*() and getFacet*() methods did, too.\n\nThe workaround is trivial, albeit clumsy: just create the parameter names by hand, as necessary.\n\nAlso, as far as I can tell, there isn't a constant for the \"f.\" prefix. That would be helpful, too.",
