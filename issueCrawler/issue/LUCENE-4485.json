    "description": "I was looking at the CheckIndex output on and index that has deletions, eg:\n\n  4 of 30: name=_90 docCount=588408\n    codec=Lucene41\n    compound=false\n    numFiles=14\n    size (MB)=265.318\n    diagnostics = {os=Linux, os.version=3.2.0-23-generic, mergeFactor=10, source=merge, lucene.version=5.0-SNAPSHOT, os.arch=amd64, mergeMaxNumSegments=-1, java.version=1.7.0_07, java.vendor=Oracle Corporation}\n    has deletions [delGen=1]\n    test: open reader.........OK [39351 deleted docs]\n    test: fields..............OK [8 fields]\n    test: field norms.........OK [2 fields]\n    test: terms, freq, prox...OK [4910342 terms; 61319238 terms/docs pairs; 65597188 tokens]\n    test (ignoring deletes): terms, freq, prox...OK [4910342 terms; 61319238 terms/docs pairs; 70293065 tokens]\n    test: stored fields.......OK [1647171 total field count; avg 3 fields per doc]\n    test: term vectors........OK [0 total vector count; avg 0 term/freq vector fields per doc]\n    test: docvalues...........OK [0 total doc count; 1 docvalues fields]\n\n\n\nIf you compare the test: terms, freq, prox (includes deletions) and the next line (doesn't include deletions), it's confusing because only the 3rd number (tokens) reflects deletions.  I think the first two numbers should also reflect deletions?  This way an app could get a sense of how much \"deadweight\" is in the index due to un-reclaimed deletions...",
