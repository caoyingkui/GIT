    "description": "This is a followup of SOLR-8131 . In SOLR-8131 if a schema factory is not specified explicitly managed schema will be used.\n\nNow since managed schema factory is the default, when a user goes to start solr 6.0 their schema.xml file will get converted to managed-schema  . This might seem trappy or confusing to a user. Hence why don't we directly ship with a a file called managed-schema instead of schema.xml . Just a rename of the files in all the example configs that we ship. The data_driven config does that already",

Currently only example/files and data_driven config sets had this.\n\nShould this be applied to 5.x as well, since all the configs there explicitly use ManagedSchemaFactory and the rename will happen after they have started solr for the first time?
