    "description": "Today it always does a final merge, to collapse all segments into a single segment.\n\nBut typically the caller is going to re-iterate all values anyway, to go off and build an FST or a BKD tree or something, and so that final forceMerge is often not necessary and the merging can be done on the fly when the caller consumes the result.\n\nThis is somewhat tricky to do ... I'd like to break it into steps, starting with fixing the ByteSequencesReader API to implement BytesRefIterator instead of its own read(BytesRefBuilder) method as a first step.",
