    "description": "From http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/3b50cd3506952f7 :\n\nIn the QueryElevComponent (QEC) it currently throws an exception if  \nthe input Query is null (line 329).    Additionally, I've seen cases  \nwhere it's possible that the Query is not null (q is not set, but  \nq.alt is :), but the rb.getQueryString() is null, which causes an  \nNPE on line 300 or so.\n\nI'd like to suggest that if the Query is empty/null, the QEC should  \njust go on it's merry way as if there is nothing to do.  I don't think  \na lack of query means that the QEC is improperly configured, as the  \nexception message implies:\n\tThe QueryElevationComponent needs to be registered 'after' the query  \ncomponent\n\nWe should be making sure the QEC is properly registered during  \ninitialization time.\n\nThoughts?\n\n-Grant",
