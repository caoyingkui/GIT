            "content": "As mentioned to uwe on irc, i took a stab at improving hte tests for IndexUpgrader \u2013 we weren't doing any testing of the command line parsing logic, and only one of the class constructors was being tested.\n\nthis attached patch includes the new tests, as well as a quick attempt at fixing the issue reported.  it also fixes another issue discoverd by the test: \"-dir-impl\" aparently didn't work at all, because it would be interpreted as the name of the directory and then the subsequent option value would be considered bogus and cause the usage to be printed.\n\nThis patch still has some problems...\n\n1) since it now randomly tests \"verbose\" mode, it's really verbose.  i don't have any good suggestions here other them to create a static variable that defaults to System.out when the code runs normally, but the tests could set it to some MockOutputStream in a @BeforeClass\n\n2) there are some nocommit lines relate to how we randomize the \"-dir-impl\" option ... it's really kludgy now, but it's the best i could come up with w/o making changes to LuceneTestCase ... hopefully someone else has a suggestion.\n\n3) as i mentioned on irc, i'm not convinced that IndexWriterConfig doesn't also need fixed...\n\n\n\tIndexWriterConfig.setInfoStream(InfoStream) javadocs say \"If non-null, ... will be printed to this.\" but it throws an error if you try to set it to the value of null you get an error \u2013 why doesn't it just implicitly use NO_OUTPUT if the arg is null? why don't the javadocs mention NO_OUTPUT?\n\tIndexWriterConfig.setInfoStream(PrintStream) javadocs just say it's a convinience wrapper using PrintStreamInfoStream, with no mention of null at all \u2013 even if setInfoStream(InfoStream) is going to be a hard-ass about null, why can't setInfoStream(PrintStream) implicitly use NO_OUTPUT when it's arg is null?\n\n ",

            "content": "Hi Hoss,\nthanks for the patch. You can assign the issue to yourself. I just took it, because I wrote the code originally, so I wanted find out what changed.\n\nIn that case the change to Luecen 3 was, that IndexWriterConfig no longer allows null as InfoStream, but instead requires NO_OUTPUT constant (which is a good thing). While doing this change, the code in IndexUpgrader was unfortunately not upgraded. Your new tests are fine. The random directory is OK.\n\nI don't think that we should allow null in IndexWriterConfig. I don't like this behaviour in Solr (e.g., SolrResourceLoader and a lot of other classes) to use crazy defaults if somewhere null is passed. Always be explicit.\n\nThe problem is a missing @NotNull annotation, like Java 8 provides (does it?).\n\nWe should state in the javadocs that null is not allowed. ",
