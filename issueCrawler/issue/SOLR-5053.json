    "description": "Give the ability to decide during query time which analysis chain a specific query should under go.\n\nTypical use case is a multi-language index that is not indexed to a field for each language (or cannot due to multi-language docs or resource limitation). Although the text during index time goes through stemmers of language A and language B, there's no reason for a user quering in language A having to under go a stemmer of language B - this would definitely lower down the precision.\nAnother use case is if the user does not wish his specific query to get N-grammed / synonymed or any other process that the standard analysis during query does.\n\nA query parser implementation should enable quering a dummy field (or fieldType) and after the latter's analysis the analysed query would run against another field.",
