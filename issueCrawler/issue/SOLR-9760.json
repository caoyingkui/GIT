    "description": "Currently starting solr fails if the user does not have permission to write to the current directory.  This is caused by the resolve_java_vendor function writing a temporary file to the current directory (javares). \n\n\n:resolve_java_vendor\nset \"JAVA_VENDOR=Oracle\"\n\"%JAVA%\" -version 2>&1 | findstr /i \"IBM J9\" > javares\nset /p JAVA_VENDOR_OUT=<javares\ndel javares\nif NOT \"%JAVA_VENDOR_OUT%\" == \"\" (\n  set \"JAVA_VENDOR=IBM J9\"\n)\n\n\nRather than writing this temporary file to disk, The exit code of findstr can be used to determine if there is a match.  (0 == match, 1 == no match, 2 == syntax error)\n\n\n:resolve_java_vendor\n\"%JAVA%\" -version 2>&1 | findstr /i \"IBM J9\" > nul\nif %ERRORLEVEL% == 1 set \"JAVA_VENDOR=Oracle\" else set \"JAVA_VENDOR=IBM J9\"\n\n\n\nBy not writing this temp file, you can reduce the permissions solr needs.  As a work around until this is fixed, you can start solr in a directory that has the required permissions,",
