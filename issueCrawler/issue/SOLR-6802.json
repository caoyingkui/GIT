            "content": "Solr AnalyticsQuery API returns analytics by documents that don't match query.\n\nI have core named 'documents' in Solr. There are some fields like 'id', 'url', 'text', 'domain'. Also I have ResourceAnalyticsCollector which counts how many documents belongs to each resource. Example of result of resource analytics is:\n\nresources:{\n\nexample.com: 456\nexample2.com: 123\n...\n}\n\nFirst time I found problem when the query was by one domain but analytics returned result with few domains.\n\nExample:\n\nSolr query: domain:example.com\n\nNumber of documents returned by this query: 1000(All this documents belongs to example.com)\n\nAnalytics result:\n\nresources:{\n\nexample.com: 700\nexample2.com: 100\nexample3.com: 100\nexample4.com: 100\n}\n\nI looked for all documents by /select search handler and all of this documents was belonged to example.com domain.\n\nBut when I looked in analytics for documents, I have found that there are many documents which don't match query. But number of documents is the same.\n\nHere is my analytics module:\npublic class ResourceAnalyticsCollector extends DelegatingCollector{\n\n    public ResourceAnalyticsCollector(ResponseBuilder rb, IndexSearcher searcher) \n{\n        this.rb = rb;\n        this.searcher = searcher;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void collect(int docNum)\n{\n        Document doc;\n        doc = searcher.doc(docNum);\n\n             //Output document id for logs\n        String docId = doc.get(AnalyticsConstants.ID_SOLR_FIELD);\n        System.out.println(\"Doc id = \" + docId);\n\n        documentList.add(doc);\n        delegate.collect(docNum);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void finish()\n{\n        rb.rsp.add(TOTAL_RESULT_FIELD, this.getAnalyticsContext(documentList));\n    }\n\nOriginal text: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27164634/solr-analyticsquery-api-returns-analytics-by-documents-that-dont-match-query ",

It'll get more eyes and faster\nresponses which will help you faster in cases of pilot error.\n\nIn this case, the things I'd check first are\n1> what does the &debug=query output show?\n2> How many docs are being matched, i.e. what is numFound in the\nresult of the query? (forget the analytics bit for the moment).\n\nMy guess is that you're not executing the search you expect, one possibility\nis that your analysis chain is breaking up the fields into two tokens based\non the periods and you're matching all the docs because you're effectively\nsearching for domain OR com and, of course, \"com\" matches all your\ndocs. But that's just a guess since there's not much info to go on here. ",

That's an important detail.\n\nAnd your expectation is that 31.kz, gov.kz, i-news.kz should not have any counts?\n\nWhich implies you expect the tokens in your index to be things like \"kp.kz\". Have you checked that with the admin/schema browser and/or TermsComponent to verify? And it seems you also are implying that there  is only one value in \"host\" per document, have you verified that? admin/schema browser and select \"host\", then \"load info\" should show you the counts.
