We should add support for addreplica operations via preferredOperation flag as is done in other triggers like MetricsTrigger and ScheduledTrigger.\n\nThe use-case is to add replica(s) of one or more collections to a new node automatically.",

This is to ensure that all the possible (collection,shard) pair combinations are added as hints so that policy engine can select the right one.\n\tNew tests added in ComputePlanActionTest to test auto-adding replicas for multiple collections having single as well as multiple shards on new nodes.\n\n\n\nI'll commit after running precommit and tests.
