    "description": "In order to implement reusableTokenStream and be able to reset a Tokenizer, Tokenizer defines a reset(Reader) method. The problem is that this method is protected. I need to call this reset(Reader) method without having to know in advance what will be the type of the Tokenizer (I plan to have several).\nI noticed that almost all Tokenizer extensions define this method as public, and I wonder if this can be changed for Tokenizer also (I can't simply create my general Tokenizer extension and inherit from it because I want to use StandardTokenizer as well).",
