    "description": "See discussion at http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/52017?search_string=deprecating%20indexmodifier;#52017\n\nThis is to deprecate IndexModifier before 3.0 and remove it in 3.0.\n\nThis patch includes:\n  1 IndexModifier and TestIndexModifier are deprecated.\n  2 TestIndexWriterModify is added. It is similar to TestIndexModifer but uses IndexWriter and has a few other changes. The changes are because of the difference between IndexModifier and IndexWriter.\n  3 TestIndexWriterLockRelease and TestStressIndexing are switched to use IndexWriter instead of IndexModifier.",
