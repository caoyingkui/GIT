    "description": "In the collection1 example, the SpellCheckComponent uses the query analyzer of \"text_general\" FieldType. If \"queryAnalyzerFieldType\" is removed from the configuration a WhitespaceAnalyzer is used by default.\n\nI suggest we could change the default to SimpleAnalyzer so that \"foo\" and \"Foo\" gives the same results and log that the analyzer is missing.\n\nAlso are there more places in solrconfig which have dependencies on schema like this?",
