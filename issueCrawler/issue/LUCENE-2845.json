    "description": "I think we should move lucene/contrib/benchmark to a shared modules/benchmark, so you can easily benchmark anything (lucene, solr, other modules like analysis or whatever).\n\nFor example, if you want to do some benchmarking of something in solr (LUCENE-2844) you should be able to do this.\nAnother example is simply being able to benchmark an analyzer definition from a schema.xml, its more convenient than writing the equivalent java analyzer just for benchmarking.",
