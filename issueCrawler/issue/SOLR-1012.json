            "content": "I'm about to revert this. Its original conception made sense, but then SolrIndexReader was introduced and this change made it so that the Lucene IndexSearcher was init'd with a regular IndexReader rather than a SolrIndexReader. The new Lucene filter stuff just committed casts to a SolrIndexReader, and so expects the Lucene IndexSearcher to hand it a SolrIndexReader. Thats a pain to accomplish with inheritance, so moving back to delegation. It wasn't much of a win to begin with (minor code elimination), so no use fighting for it. "
