    "description": "The SignatureUpdateProcessorFactory used (primarily?) for deduplication does not consider partial update semantics.\n\nThe below uses the following solrconfig.xml excerpt:\n\n\n     <updateRequestProcessorChain name=\"text_hash\">\n       <processor class=\"solr.processor.SignatureUpdateProcessorFactory\">\n         <bool name=\"enabled\">true</bool>\n         <str name=\"signatureField\">text_hash</str>\n         <bool name=\"overwriteDupes\">false</bool>\n         <str name=\"fields\">text</str>\n         <str name=\"signatureClass\">solr.processor.TextProfileSignature</str>\n       </processor>\n       <processor class=\"solr.LogUpdateProcessorFactory\" />\n       <processor class=\"solr.RunUpdateProcessorFactory\" />\n     </updateRequestProcessorChain>\n\n\n\nFirstly, the processor treats \n\n{\"set\": \"value\"}\n\n as a string and hashes it, instead of the value alone:\n\n\n$ curl '$URL/update?commit=true' -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{\"add\":{\"doc\":{\"id\": \"abcde\", \"text\": {\"set\": \"hello world\"}}}}' && curl '$URL/select?q=id:abcde'\n{\"responseHeader\":{\"status\":0,\"QTime\":30}}\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><response><lst name=\"responseHeader\"><int name=\"status\">0</int><int name=\"QTime\">1</int><lst name=\"params\"><str name=\"q\">id:abcde</str></lst></lst><result name=\"response\" numFound=\"1\" start=\"0\"><doc><str name=\"id\">abcde</str><str name=\"text\">hello world</str><str name=\"text_hash\">ad48c7ad60ac22cc</str><long name=\"_version_\">1417247434224959488</long></doc></result>\n</response>\n$\n$ curl '$URL/update?commit=true' -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{\"add\":{\"doc\":{\"id\": \"abcde\", \"text\": \"hello world\"}}}' && curl '$URL/select?q=id:abcde'\n{\"responseHeader\":{\"status\":0,\"QTime\":27}}\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<response>\n<lst name=\"responseHeader\"><int name=\"status\">0</int><int name=\"QTime\">1</int><lst name=\"params\"><str name=\"q\">id:abcde</str></lst></lst><result name=\"response\" numFound=\"1\" start=\"0\"><doc><str name=\"id\">abcde</str><str name=\"text\">hello world</str><str name=\"text_hash\">b169c743d220da8d</str><long name=\"_version_\">1417248022215000064</long></doc></result>\n</response>\n\n\n\nNote the different text_hash value.\n\nSecondly, when updating a field other than those used to create the signature (which I imagine is a more common use-case), the signature is recalculated from no values:\n\n\n$ curl '$URL/update?commit=true' -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{\"add\":{\"doc\":{\"id\": \"abcde\", \"title\": {\"set\": \"new title\"}}}}' && curl '$URL/select?q=id:abcde'\n{\"responseHeader\":{\"status\":0,\"QTime\":39}}\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<response>\n<lst name=\"responseHeader\"><int name=\"status\">0</int><int name=\"QTime\">1</int><lst name=\"params\"><str name=\"q\">id:abcde</str></lst></lst><result name=\"response\" numFound=\"1\" start=\"0\"><doc><str name=\"id\">abcde</str><str name=\"text\">hello world</str><str name=\"text_hash\">0000000000000000</str><str name=\"title\">new title</str><long name=\"_version_\">1417248120480202752</long></doc></result>\n</response>",

The DUPF gets the updated document in a synchronized (bucket) block which we don't. We could set the original document back (after adding signature to it) and let DUPF do its thing but that could lead to race conditions.\n\nPerhaps we should decouple the document expansion for partial updates from DistributedUpdateRequestProcessor and apply it at the start of the request so that all UpdateRequestProcessors can work on the full document.\n\nI don't fully comprehend the race conditions that may happen so I'll let someone more knowledgeable about this code to comment before proceeding any further.
