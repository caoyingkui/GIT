    "description": "I encountered a problem with addIndexes where term vectors disappeared following optimize(). I wrote a simple test case which demonstrates the problem. The bug appears with both addIndexes() versions, but does not appear if addDocument is called twice, committing changes in between.\n\nI think I tracked the problem down to IndexWriter.mergeMiddle() \u2013 it sets term vectors before merger.merge() was called. In the addDocs case, merger.fieldInfos is already populated, while in the addIndexes case it is empty, hence fieldInfos.hasVectors returns false.\n\nwill post a patch shortly.",

If you don't apply the fix to IndexWriter, the tests which call addIndexes fail.\n\nIt also moves the setHasVectors call after merger.merge() in IndexWriter.\n\nBTW, if you omit the optimize() call and the fix to IW, the tests pass.

Therefore I think I should keep the 4.0 fix version?\n\nThe problem is that SegmentMerger receives its FieldInfos from DocumentsWriter, and it knows whether to set hasVector according to what it receives. When you addDoc, DW has FieldInfos, but when you only addIndexes, DW doesn't.\n\nIn fact, the field infos are read only on IW open ... so even if I addIndexes(), commit(), addIndexes(), the field infos would still be missing. A workaround I see for now is to addIndexes(), close(), new IW(), continue with addIndexes() or optimize(). Which is ugly but it's a workaround until we release a new version. I'll try that.\n\nIf it's ok, I'll commit the fix to 3x and the tests-only to trunk. ",
