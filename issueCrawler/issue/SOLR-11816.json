    "description": "During rolling restarts, even when replication factor >=2 (maxShardsPerNode=1), there's a latency spike.\n\nI've seen many of my clients being hit by this issue. In some cases during rolling restarts, the shards get into a leaderless state (which I'm still reproducing).\n\nI've put together a reproduction suite using docker, influxdb and grafana.\nhttps://github.com/chatman/solr-grafana-docker/tree/rolling-restart-test\n\nSteps:\n\n\tRun docker-compose up\n\tOpen Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (user: admin/pw: admin)\n\tRun indexing.sh and querying.sh both in separate terminals\n\tLet the graphs build up a bit, and then run rolling-restarts.sh\n\tA latency spike (about 4x) is observed.",
