MoveReplicaCmd add new replicas on nodeB\n4. nodeA comes back, and on preRegister, the old replicas still there\n5. MoveReplicaCmd remove nodeA replicas from ZK\n6. nodeA register its replicas as DOWN on ZK -> this lead to the assertion failure\n\nThe solution right now is to fix the test first ( so race condition cannot happen ), then we will solve the race condition problem after that.
