    "description": "In the SOLR admin web console, when displaying JSON response for Query, the text is not being HTML escaped, so any text that happens to match HTML markup is being processed as HTML. \n\nFor example, enter \"<strike>hello</strike>\" in the \"q\" textbox and the responseHeader will contain:\n\n\"q\": \"body:hello\" where the \"hello\" portion is shown using strikeout.  \n\nThis seems benign, but can be extremely confusing when viewing results, because if your fields happen to contain, for example, <foo@bar.com>, this will be completely missing (because the browser treats this as an invalid tag).",
