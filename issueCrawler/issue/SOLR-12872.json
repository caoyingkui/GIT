    "description": "While working on SOLR-5004, I realized how confusing the current SPLITSHARD API can get.\u00a0Here's the current set of options to split a shard:\n\n\tSpecify split.key but not with shard name. Providing the shard name here leads to an exception\n\tSpecify ranges with shard name (actually the same as above) but requires the shard name\n\tNot specify ranges OR split.key. This will split the specified shard into 2 from the middle of the hash range.\n\n\n\nsplit.key is just a syntactic sugar on top of the shard + ranges combination. Ideally, we can even figure out shard name from the ranges, but for the sake of consistency it perhaps makes sense to make shard name mandatory.\n\nI propose that we deprecate split.key and only allow 2 options:\n\n\tshard name + ranges\n\tshard name + (optional numSubShards as part of SOLR-5004). The number of sub-shards defaults to 2.\n\n\n\nThe intention here is to simplify the API by providing fewer but more consistent and intuitive options.",
