    "description": "I was banging my head trying to figure out why SOLR-5795 combined with SOLR-5823 wasn't working when I noticed something interesting as a result of some gratuituous logging:\n\n\n\tthe control server thinks it's in running in cloud mode, in a cluster consisting solely of itself, and acts as overseer\n\tnone of the nodes in the actual cluster being tested think they are the overseer\n\n\n\n...i haven't dug in very deep, but i suspect that some combination of the control server starting up first and thinking it's part of zk is leading to it becoming the overseer, even thought it evidently never thinks it's one of the leaders/replicas of the cloud cluster.\n\nIt's hard to see this problem w/o SOLR-5823 \u2013 i'll update the patch there with a test showing hte problem, but i wanted to make sure it got tracked in it's own bug.",

There should be one overseer across the entire cluster and it can be any node having a shard for any collection as long as it is aware of the same Zookeeper ensemble. "

            "content": "Hmmm... ok: I definitely see that i was being stupid in thinking that every node in the cluster would be involved in hosting \"collection1\", and thus: the overseer may not be running on one of the nodes hosting the collection.  But....\n\nIt still seems really weird to me that the control server is part of the cluster (and can act as the overseer):\n\n1) that means the control server and the control_collection are running in \"zk mode\" so all of the test scaffolding that executes parallel queries against the cloudClient and the controlClient and then compares the results isn't actually comparing a cloud mode response with a standalone mode response \u2013 it's comparing a cloud mode multi-shard response with a cloud mode single-shard response.\n\n2) can't this lead to inconsistencies in chaos tests if the chaos monkey shuts down the server running the control_collection?

That would increase coverage a bit. Randomly prefer all the collection1 jetties.\n\nOr you could change things at a deeper level to create more separation. Probably that's ideal, but given I can't work on it soon, I'm just as +1 on simply getting some Overseer kills in a chaosmonkey run with whatever improvement. "
