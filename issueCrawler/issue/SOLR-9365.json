    "description": "There is too much unnecessary logging of exceptions during a graceful shutdown. This is mostly due to:\n\n\tWatcher invocations fired after the zk callback executor is shutdown, and\n\tSession expiry because of zkclient or embedded zk server shutdown\n\n\n\nWe should add a simple check for such conditions to reduce noise in our logs.",
