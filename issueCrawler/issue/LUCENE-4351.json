            "content": "Here's the patch; there were many changes needed.  Many were trivial, like GeohashUtils and ParseUtils moving to the .io. package, or SimpleSpatialContext being just SpatialContext now.  The biggest change was circle.getRadius() and DistanceCalculator.distance() being degrees based.  Chris and I thought it best that Lucene spatial retain distance unit neutrality, and hence the distance ValueSource out of the SpatialStrategy is in degrees as well.\n\nAlso, I modified the complex TestRecursivePrefixTreeStrategy.geohashRecursiveRandom() test to use circular data clusters instead of rectangular, since at the poles those rectangles don't look too rectangular   May not have been strictly necessary as part of the patch but while debugging an unknown failure I wanted to make this improvement.
