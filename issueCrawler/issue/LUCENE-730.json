I think this\ncould be expected because of the changed document scoring order\nfor top level disjunction queries.\nAt the moment I don't know how to resolve this.\n\nWith the complete patch, all tests pass here.

IMO allowing docs out of order is a big\nAPI change. I think if people switch to 2.2 they just want it\nto work as before without having to add special settings. If \nthey need better performance for certain types of queries and \nthey know that their application can deal with docs out of order\nthey can enable the faster scoring. \nSo my vote is +1 for docs in order by default.\n\n> Some performance tests with prohibited scorers could still\n> be needed to find out which of the boolean scorers does better\n> on them. \n\nThat'd be helpful. However, I'm currently working on some other\nissues. Maybe you or others would have some time to run those\ntests? ",
