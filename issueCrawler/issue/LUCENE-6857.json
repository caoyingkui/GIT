LUCENE-6249 fixes following issue from 5.1.\n\nOriginal issue description:\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for your reply Erick,\nI have gone through the document provided by you.\nHowever what I have observed is that there is difference if we parse query with Lucene 4.10.3 and Lucene 5.2.0 onwards.\nFor example :Query String: lottery AND (NOT ticket)Lucene 4.x parsed it as: +lottery +ticket\nLucene 5.1.x parsed it as: +lottery +(-ticket)\nAnd I want result as 5.1.x produces. But as I am not planning to upgrade lucene now so looking for fix for lucene 4.10.x.\nPlease could you help on this?\nThanks,Mrugesh\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nProvided patch for test case. \n\nAdded testcases to validate LUCENE-6249 "
