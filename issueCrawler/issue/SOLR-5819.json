    "description": "As noted on the solr-user mailing list in response to the ANNOUNCE about the 4.7 ref guide, the size of the 4.4, 4.5 & 4.6 PDF files were all under 5MB, but the 4.7 PDF was 30MB.\n\nWe've determine that the root cause is a bug in confluence 5.0 (related to duplicating images) that is fixed in 5.4.3 \u2013 the next version Infra currently plans to upgrade to.\n\nUntil such time as the upgrade is finished, a work arround is to use a manual pdf shrinking tool such as this one to eliminate the duplication...\n\nhttps://github.com/hossman/pdf-shrinker",

I suspect the screenshots are causing it to balloon - we made some changes to the way they appear in the PDF for 4.7 which may be the cause, but also the software was upgraded and maybe the newer version is handling them differently.\n\nsarowe...\n\nNot sure if it\u2019s relevant anymore, but a few years ago Atlassian resolved as \"won\u2019t fix\u201d a request to configure\nexported PDF compression ratio: <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-21329>.  Their suggestion: zip the PDF.  I\ntried that - the resulting zip size is roughly 9MB, so it\u2019s definitely compressible.\n\nrmuir...\n\nI debugged the PDF a little. FWIW, the following code (using iText)\ntakes it to 9MB:\n\n\n  public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {\n    Document document = new Document();\n    PdfSmartCopy copy = new PdfSmartCopy(document, new\nFileOutputStream(\"/home/rmuir/Downloads/test.pdf\"));\n    //copy.setCompressionLevel(9);\n    //copy.setFullCompression();\n    document.open();\n    PdfReader reader = new\nPdfReader(\"/home/rmuir/Downloads/apache-solr-ref-guide-4.7.pdf\");\n    int pages = reader.getNumberOfPages();\n    for (int i = 0; i < pages; i++) {\n      PdfImportedPage page = copy.getImportedPage(reader, i+1);\n      copy.addPage(page);\n    }\n    copy.freeReader(reader);\n    reader.close();\n    document.close();\n  }\n\n "

Very rarely would the same icon appear 2x on a single page - since they're meant to highlight something, I purposefully use them very rarely. The most common of those boxes used, \"note\", only appears on 48 pages: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/dosearchsite.action?queryString=macroName%3Anote&where=solr. That's the exclamation mark in a triangle.\n\nWhy the PDF has 25,000 copies of that is bizarre to me. Even if we replaced the specific icon, we'd want to make sure the replacement also didn't get replicated like that, which maybe is what Robert's approach would achieve.\n\n(as a side note, there's some research to suggest that those boxes may be overlooked anyway, i.e., \"banner blindness\", although personally I think they work better in the PDF than on the screen. It may be worth thinking about how they're being used and replacing them something more lightweight might have more than one benefit. here's a link if you're interested: http://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/banner-blindness-and-technical-documentation/) "

(I searched for a related bug in their issue tracker but didn't find anything.)\n\nAnd so maybe all we have to do is wait for Infrastructure to upgrade the production Confluence instance from the current v5.0.3 to v5.4.3?
