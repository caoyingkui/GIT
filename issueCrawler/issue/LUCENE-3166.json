    "description": "I noticed that the source package contains a \"docs\" subdir with all the site's docs. Also, the root has index.html which nicely points to all those documents. However, it also points to the Javadocs which are absent. If you \"ant javadocs\", they are built under build/docs/api, which makes the links in index.html still invalid.\n\nIterating on it shortly, Robert and I think that the following should be done:\n\n\thave src/site docs built under src/site/build. Today they already are, but later \"cp -r\" under /docs, so we should remove the copy instruction.\n\thave \"ant docs\" or \"ant generate-docs\" which generates javadocs + copy src/site/build under build/docs. Then all links will still work.\n\tremove \"docs\" from svn and keep them under src/site/build.\n\n\n\nMarking it a blocker for 3.3 so we revisit before then.",
