    "description": "The current SpellingQueryConverter spell checks individual words only, but in the case of products or names, it is sometimes better to spell check groups of words together.  For example if you are searching a person's name, you might want to compute the edit distance against the whole person's name, not individual words.  For example:\n\nIf I search for Jonny Cash with the current SpellingQueryConverter, it won't suggest any fixes cause we have both an artist with the name Jonny in it and of course the artist who we really want, Johnny Cash.  If we don't delimit the words, it will realize Jonny Cash as a whole doesn't exist and will return Johnny Cash instead as a did you mean.  \n\nThe other advantage of this is that it gets rid of the possibility of the did you mean suggesting a spell correction for one of the two (or more) words that also doesn't exist.  Let's say hypothetically we searched for Jonny Cash again, the did you mean might currently suggest Jinny Cash, who also doesn't exist.  If we don't delimit the words going into the spellchecker, this shouldn't happen.",

So I think your use-case can also be solved by creating your dictionary from a Solr field which has a KeywordTokenizer and using spellcheck.q parameter. "
