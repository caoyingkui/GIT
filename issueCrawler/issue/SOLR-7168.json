Putting the OutputStream into a try with resources (instead of org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.closeQuietly()) and replacing FileUtils.sync() to oal.util.IOUtils.fsync() fixes the failure.\n\nJust a thought, since the FileUtils.sync() mentions it has been copied from FSDirectory.fsync() and that FSDirectory.fsync() itself is now just a wrapper to oal.util.IOUtils.fsync(), shouldn't we just remove FileUtils.sync() altogether? It seems to be referred to from SnapPuller and ManagedIndexSchema. ",
