    "description": "I noticed in my writing of the stress test in SOLR-11949 that I had been forced to parse an exception message to identify the cases where the document was out of range (an expected condition) vs other solr errors. The attached patch supplies a custom exception class that can be explicitly checked for via traversing getCause() (or inspecting getThrowables() or getMetadata().get(\"root-error-class\") )",
