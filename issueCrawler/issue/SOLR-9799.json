    "description": "Jerome Yang from the user's list asked about this, I verified in 6x. Steps to reproduce:\n\n\tcreate a one-shard, leader-only collection on a single Solr node\n\tpush a flawed configuration to Zookeeper (I forced a syntax error in managed-schema)\n\tRELOAD the collection, see the error.\n\tDELETE the collection\n\tfix and push the config to ZK\n\ttry to CREATE the same collection again error:  Core with name 'eoe_shard1_replica1' already exists.\n\trestart the Solr instance\n\tyou can successfully CREATE the collection now.\n\n\n\nNOTE: If you push the corrected configs and don't DELETE, you can RELOAD the collection without restarting Solr.\n\nCuriously, the core is actually not on disk, I'm guessing that it's in the CoreDescirptor list still or some such.\n\nThanks for reporting Jerome!",
