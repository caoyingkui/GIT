This alternative patch adds an abstract doInit method to the SolrMetricReporter base class.\n\nNot yet included in this patch is the addition of try-catch blocks around the validate() and doInit() calls, and to potentially differentiate behavior for enabled=true vs. enabled=false reporters.\n\nRelated open questions:\n\n\tHow would the <bool name=\"enabled\">...</bool> property typically be used?\n\tMight used of a enable=\"...\" attribute be an alternative to the property? e.g.\n\n<reporter enable=\"...\" name=\"...\" class=\"...\">\n  ...\n</reporter>\n\n\nAs far as I know, an enable=\"false\" attribute would be equivalent to the <reporter> element not being present at all whereas an enabled=\"false\" property can be explictly considered in (potentially multiple) parts of the code.\n\n ",
