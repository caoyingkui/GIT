There's also an @Before method that deletes all collections with the note:\n\n//TODO this is necessary when -Dtests.iters but why?

So if test() runs first, testParse() will fail in the @Before method because an alias still points to one of the live collections. Simple fix to delete the alias in @Before.\n\nSolr doesn't care if you delete an alias that's not there so this should be fine. Single test with that seed succeeds\n\nRunning a test now with tests.iters=100 just to exercise the suite since the comment makes me nervous, will probably check this in this evening.\n\nI'll leave this JIRA open for a while though in case other variants pop out.

That explains why this test fails ever since you made a change that causes collection deletion to fail if it's pointed at by an alias.  Do you have any idea why this doBefore is needed here at all (i.e. you do you understand the root cause of my comment)?  When I ran the tests either from my IDE or Ant, it worked fine.  But when I use Ant with -Dtests.iters=2 or higher, it would fail every time it got to the second iteration.  I don't recall it mattered that there was a 2nd test method.  It's weird. ",
