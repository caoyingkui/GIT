    "description": "As part of adding additional scoring systems to lucene, we made a lower-level Similarity\nand the existing stuff became e.g. TFIDFSimilarity which extends it.\n\nHowever, I always feel bad about the complexity introduced here (though I do feel there\nare some \"excuses\", that its a difficult challenge).\n\nIn order to try to mitigate this, we also exposed an easier API (SimilarityBase) on top of \nit that makes some assumptions (and trades off some performance) to try to provide something \nconsumable for e.g. experiments.\n\nStill, we can cleanup a few things with the low-level api: fix outdated documentation and\nshoot for better/clearer naming etc.",

Specifically with this commit:\n\n\ncommit 5d371928263d8d78d0e52781340ae95506bd9bf6\nAuthor: Robert Muir <rmuir@apache.org>\nDate:   Mon Feb 6 12:48:01 2012 +0000\n\n    LUCENE-3749: replace SimilarityProvider with PerFieldSimilarityWrapper\n    \n    git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk@1241001 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68\n\n\n\nI have the following configuration in my schema.xml:\n\n\n<fieldtype name=\"payloads\" stored=\"false\" indexed=\"true\" class=\"solr.TextField\" >\n  <analyzer>\n    <tokenizer class=\"com.foo.lucene.analysis.core.PayloadTermTokenizerFactory\"/>\n    <filter class=\"solr.DelimitedPayloadTokenFilterFactory\" encoder=\"float\"/>\n  </analyzer>\n  <analyzer type=\"query\">\n    <tokenizer class=\"solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory\"/>\n    <filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n  </analyzer>\n  <similarity class=\"com.foo.lucene.search.PayloadSimilarity\" />\n</fieldtype>\n\n\n\nBut when I build against and use a version of a Solr with the commit mentioned above, my similarity class is no longer executed. I've confirmed this by putting prints in the scorePayload(), tf() and idf() functions and noticing they print before and don't print after including that commit.\n\nIt seems this is intentional, based on Robert Muir's comments, but how can you get per-field similarity to work in Solr with this new code?
