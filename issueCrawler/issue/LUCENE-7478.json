    "description": "It seems that the formula in LMDirichletSimilarity is wrong or at least is not the formula in the mentioned C.X. Zhai paper. \n\nThe main part of formula in LMDirichletSimilarity is:\nMath.log(1 + freq /\n        (mu * ((LMStats)stats).getCollectionProbability())) +\n        Math.log(mu / (docLen + mu)\n\nwhich is in fact:\n(mu*p(w|C)+c(w,d))/(p(w|C)*(|d| + mu))\n\nwhile the main formula is:\n(mu*p(w|C)+c(w,d))/(|d| + mu)\n\nSo a p(w|C) is practically added to the formula.",
