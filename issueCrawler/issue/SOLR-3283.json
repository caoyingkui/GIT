It didn't seem worth a CHANGES.txt entry.\n\nBy the way, this issue is slightly related to my observation and comment with patch here:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3161?focusedCommentId=13239186&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13239186\n\nCan this be committed to 3x tonight for inclusion in 3.6?  I ask because it's kinda late. "
