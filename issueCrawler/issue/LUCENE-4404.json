    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-3842.  This just generalizes the\nUpToTwoPositiveIntOutputs to a list of any arbitrary output, by\nwrapping any other Outputs impl.  I also made separate methods to\nwrite/read a node-final output: since list of values can only occur on\na final node output, this impl optimizes and avoids writing an extra\nbyte per label for normal arc labels.\n\nThis also fixes a bug in Builder that was sometimes failing to join\nmultiple outputs together.",

            "content": "That's a good point about the bit-stealing: I forgot it did that.  So I agree the new ListOfOutputs will likely make a larger FST ... but it shouldn't be so bad since it's only on the node-final outputs that it adds a byte.  Also it's more general (can wrap any output (not just PositiveInt), can hold an arbitrary number).\n\nSo I'll revive UpToTwoPositiveIntOutputs, and move it to misc (nobody actually uses it today... I think BlockTree had used it at one point), and put this new ListOfOutputs into misc too. ",
