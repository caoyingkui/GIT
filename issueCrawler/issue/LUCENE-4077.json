            "content": "Hello Mike,\n\nthank you for the patch. There is one small problem: ToParentBlockJoinCollector.getMaxScore() always returns NaN. This happens because maxScore is initialized as \n\nprivate float maxScore = Float.NaN;\n\n\nand then updated as\n\nmaxScore = Math.max(score, maxScore);\n\n\nwhich is always NaN.\n\nI hope I applied the patch to the correct revision and this is not caused by a version conflict.
