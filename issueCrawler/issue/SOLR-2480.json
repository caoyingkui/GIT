    "description": "Proposal:\nThere are password-protected files. PDF, Office documents in 2007 format/97 format.\nThese files are posted using SolrCell.\nWe do not have to read these files if we do not know the reading password of files.\nSo, these files may not be extracted text.\nMy requirement is that these files should be processed normally without extracting text, and without throwing exception.\n\nThis background:\nNow, when you post a password-protected file, solr returns 500 server error.\nSolr catches the error in ExtractingDocumentLoader and throws TikException.\n\nI use ManifoldCF.\nIf the solr server responds 500, ManifoldCF judge is that \"this\ndocument should be retried because I have absolutely no idea what\nhappened\".\nAnd it attempts to retry posting many times without getting the password.\n\nIn the other case, my customer posts the files with embedded images.\nSometimes it seems that solr throws TikaException of unknown cause.\nHe wants to post just metadata without extracting text, but makes him stop posting by the exception.",

(see my comment above)\n\nAs I understand your requirement that was described in Description, and it is quite similar SOLR-2512 that has been resolved, I'll try a patch that has ignoreErrors flag for TikaException.\n\nI added an ability to ignore exceptions when trying to extract mata data from text in SOLR-2512, i.g. Solr indexed the text but gave up meta data. On the other hand, the ignore flag in this ticket is for giving up text but indexing meta data. It cannot be resolved by SOLR-445. "
