On one hand \u2013 I agree that having larger test files is good and on the other I agree with Robert that not being able to reproduce locally because of different (or inconsistent) data is a pain.\n\nAt Carrot Search we have put all the \"big data\" into a separate git repository and this is simply mirrored across build servers and our local machines. Granted, the first clone takes a while, but then pulls of additional data are much faster and (which is a big plus) git repo has an md5 of the revision so this can be emitted as a log upon failure (we don't do it because we're pretty much sure the checkouts are consistent, but it could be done to ensure testing against exact same test files).\n\nJust thoughts to consider.\n ",

I dont think we should be downloading\n  this from SVN, since our source releases would actually have this as a test dependency.\n\n ",
