            "content": "Indeed, the logic is backwards now.  I was wondering how Lucene could possible be working, since listAll is used when opening a non-near-real-time DirectoryReader, but then I realized it's only the static FSDirectory.listAll(Path) that tickles this bug since the non-static version always passes pendingDeletes.\n\nThank you for the patch w/ test case Atkins Chang ... I'll push soon. ",
