    "description": "David Boychuck reported on #solr that the Page for Logging/Level only shows a spinning wheel w/o actually finishing at some time.\n\nUncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n\nwas the error message which led me to the suggestion, that the javascript goes crazy while building up the loglevel tree.\n\nthe attached patch includes an additional check for an empty logger-name, which does not fix the root of the problem (will open another issue for that one) but at least avoid confusion because the page doesn't get loaded at all.",
