    "description": "CLUSTERSTATUS action reports the state of replicas but it doesn't check /live_nodes, which means it might show a replica as \"active\" but the node is down, so the real state is \"down\".\n\nIdeally, we need a helper method that gets replica status that consults live nodes so this error doesn't keep cropping up all over the code base.",
