    "description": "Enabling/disabling caches should not affect behavior \u2013 just performance.\n\nAnd yet, w/caches enabled by default (either implicitly or explicitly) in our test configs, it's easy to overlook bugs that exist because of code assumptions that only hold up when cahces are enabled \u2013 SOLR-12108 & SOLR-12107 are 2 great examples of this.\n\nWe should update all of our configs used in tests (including the techproduct sample configs used for \"example\" tests) to use sysprops to enable/disable all the caches (documentCache, filterCache, queyResultCache) and then make SolrTestCaseJ4 randomize all of those system properties independently.  Tests that depend on explicit state should explicitly set those properties.",
