Its not that I feel it doesn't belong there, I just want people reading changes to know that bug is fixed - its bitten a couple people in the past (multifields/highlighter). Koji has been waiting patiently for the fix for some time for one  Its not a big deal for sure, but I think we should just put it twice - I can copy it to the bug section as well. I've seen an issue make 3 sections, so 2 should be no problem \n\nApologize for being in the wrong issue again by the way - finding myself in the wrong place a lot lately. ",
