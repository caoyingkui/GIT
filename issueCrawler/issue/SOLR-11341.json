Those scripts are meant to just run, they're communicating with Zookeeper.\n\nI can't tell whether you have access to the Configsets API or not but that is easier if you have a recent Solr.\n\nWhen you post to the user's list if that's not helpful, you should include the solr version, how you started Solr and the like. You might review:\n\nhttps://wiki.apache.org/solr/UsingMailingLists\n\nPlease raise this question on the user's list at solr-user@lucene.apache.org, see: (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc) there are a lot more people watching that list who may be able to help. \n\nIf it's determined that this really is a code issue in Solr and not a configuration/usage problem, we can raise a new JIRA or reopen this one.
