    "description": "When a JettySolrRunner is restarted, it currently tries to reuse the same port as it was running on before the restart.  This can lead to stale connections, and test failures (see SOLR-6944 for an example, but it seems to be happening in other tests, CollectionStateWatchersTest for example).  In plenty of cases, we don't actually need to restart on the same port, so we should add the ability to ignore previous port numbers and just come up on any port that is available.",
