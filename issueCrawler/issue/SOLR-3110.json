I'm using trunk. I got the following snippet that was I expected one:\n\n\n<lst name=\"highlighting\">\n  <lst name=\"2\">\n    <arr name=\"includes\">\n      <str> How Are <em>Clock</em> Gating Checks Inferred</str>\n    </arr>\n  </lst>\n</lst>\n\n\n\nMy BoundaryScanner setting is:\n\n\n<boundaryScanner name=\"default\"\n                 default=\"true\"\n                 class=\"solr.highlight.SimpleBoundaryScanner\">\n  <lst name=\"defaults\">\n    <str name=\"hl.bs.maxScan\">100</str>\n    <str name=\"hl.bs.chars\">.!?</str>\n  </lst>\n</boundaryScanner>\n\n\n\nMy request was:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=clock&hl=on&hl.fl=includes&hl.useFastVectorHighlighter=true\n\nI'm using the following sample data that's been provided by Shyam in the mail thread:\n\n\n<add>\n  <doc>\n    <field name=\"id\">1</field>\n    <field name=\"includes\">User-defined resolution functions.

After some looking into this issue, I believe the\nproblem of chopped word has to do with\norg.apache.lucene.search.vectorhighlight.SimpleFragListBuilder class'\n'margin' field. It is set to 6 by default. My understanding is having margin\nvalue of greater than zero results in truncated word when the highlighted\nterm is too close to beginning of a document. I was able to reset the\n'margin' field by creating my custom version of\norg.apache.solr.highlight.SimpleFragListBuilder and passing zero for\n'margin' when calling the Lucene's SimpleFragListBuilder constructor. My\ntesting shows the problem has been fixed. Do you concur?\n\n  Now couple of questions. Not sure what the purpose of this field is, could\nyou give the use case for it? Also could it be exposed as a parameter in\nSolr so it could be set to some other value?\n\nThanks,\n\nKoorosh "
