    "description": "This patch uncomments and fixes some code in SolrCore that was checking that only SearchHandlers were accessible in distributed search.\n\nIt appears to have been commented out because it was breaking the /spell handler in the examples.  I believe I've figured out the cause of the problem and have written (mostly uncommented, tbh) some unit tests to demonstrate that the /spell handler will work fine now, while still disallowing non-SearchHandlers (such as /update).\n\nHere's a short blog post I wrote on the subject: http://wp.me/p1t8Ca-Hm\n\nAttached are separate patches for the fix and the unit tests, so you can verify that the tests fail before the fix and succeed afterward.",
