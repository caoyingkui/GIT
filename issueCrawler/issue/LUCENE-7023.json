See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Manifest_Specification.\n\nSpecifically, the spec says:\n\nLine length:\nNo line may be longer than 72 bytes (not characters), in its UTF8-encoded form. If a value would make the initial line longer than this, it should be continued on extra lines (each starting with a single SPACE).\n\nSo I think we just need to update the smoke tester to understand line continuation?
