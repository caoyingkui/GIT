The data are successfully uploaded but the field name.first and name.last are not stored and I cannot retrieve them when I search (over all my collection).\n\nI checked the extracted schema and the missing fields are present!\n\nIn addition, if I upload only one document using the upload/json/docs the fields are stored in the collection.\n\nI think that I discovered a little bug in the multiple upload with nested data types.\n\nI didn't try with a schema definition and with the XML data format instead with the JSON one.",
