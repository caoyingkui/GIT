I create an index in a RAMDirectory, add two documents with content \"tina\" and \"~tina\", using Field.Index.TOKENIZED and search for \"~tina\" using the QueryParser and IndexSearcher. If I use Simple- or StandardAnalyzer (for both IndexWriter and QueryParser) I get two results, which is correct, because both analyzers drop the ~. However, the WhitespaceAnalyzer doesn't drop the ~ and consequently I get only one result.\n\nSo I think this is not reproducable (anymore). I suggest to close this issue, especially since nobody commented on it for over a year. ",
