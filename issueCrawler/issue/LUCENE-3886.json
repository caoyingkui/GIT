    "description": "After LUCENE-3867 was committed, there are some more minor problems with MemoryIndex's estimates. This patch will fix those and also add verbose test output of RAM needed for MemoryIndex vs. RAMDirectory.\n\nInterestingly, the RAMDirectory always takes (according to estimates, so even with buffer overheads) only 2/3 of the MemoryIndex (excluding IndexReaders).",
