    "description": "Since the file modification resolution on OSX appears to be 1000ms, the touchFile method in \nFSDirectory ends up not actually modifying the file's modification time. This in turn causes the \nIndexReader not to detect that it is working with stale info, thus losing information.\n\nThe same problem happens in the optimize call, where a new segment file is written, but this is \nnot detected as being 'newer' than the old one.\n\nI am unsure of whether the fixes I propose are 100% correct though (adding a directory.touchFile \nat the end of the optimize method). Maybe there should be some locking involved, as this could \ntake up to a second?\n\nAnyway, here's a patch, so those in the know can decide on exactly how to tweak it to ensure it's \nperfect for all situations",
