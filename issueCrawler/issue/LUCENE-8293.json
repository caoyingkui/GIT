If a soft delete is added while a segment is merged the document\n    might end up hard deleted in the target segment. This isn't necessarily a\n    correctness issue but causes unnecessary writes of hard-deletes. The biggest\n    issue here is that we assert that previously deleted documents are still deleted\n    in the live-docs we apply and that might be violated by the retention policy.",
