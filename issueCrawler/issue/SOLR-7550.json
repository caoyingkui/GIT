    "description": "4 node cluster we stopped a node and started that node back up. Prior to the node starting up a schema change was made that was invalid. When the node started back up the core could not load as the schema was invalid. While in this state the leader was restarted as well (so now two nodes in this bad state). When the remaining two nodes attempted to become leader and PeerSync they were getting a 500 error back from these failed-to-start cores and were not able to become leaders, which eventually lead to the remaining two nodes ending up in \"recovery_failed\" state and the cluster being offline.\n\nSome logs:\n\n\n2015-05-14 17:03:20.712 INFO  ShardLeaderElectionContext [main-EventThread] - Running the leader process for shard shard1\n2015-05-14 17:03:20.720 INFO  ShardLeaderElectionContext [main-EventThread] - Checking if I should try and be the leader.\n2015-05-14 17:03:20.720 INFO  ShardLeaderElectionContext [main-EventThread] - My last published State was Active, it's okay to be the leader.\n2015-05-14 17:03:20.720 INFO  ShardLeaderElectionContext [main-EventThread] - I may be the new leader - try and sync\n2015-05-14 17:03:20.720 WARN  RecoveryStrategy [main-EventThread] - Stopping recovery for zkNodeName=host-a2:12345_solr_xxxxcore=xxxx\n2015-05-14 17:03:23.220 INFO  SyncStrategy [main-EventThread] - Sync replicas to http://host-a2:12345/solr/xxxx/\n2015-05-14 17:03:23.221 INFO  PeerSync [main-EventThread] - PeerSync: core=xxxx url=http://host-a2:12345/solr START replicas=[http://host-b1:12345/solr/xxxx/, http://host-a1:12345/solr/xxxx_shard1/] nUpdates=100\n2015-05-14 17:03:23.238 INFO  PeerSync [main-EventThread] - PeerSync: core=xxxx url=http://host-a2:12345/solr  Received 96 versions from http://host-b1:12345/solr/xxxx/\n2015-05-14 17:03:23.239 INFO  PeerSync [main-EventThread] - PeerSync: core=xxxx url=http://host-a2:12345/solr  Our versions are newer. ourLowThreshold=1501178223728263172 otherHigh=1501178223745040385\n2015-05-14 17:03:23.385 WARN  PeerSync [main-EventThread] - PeerSync: core=xxxx url=http://host-a2:12345/solr  exception talking to http://host-a1:12345/solr/xxxx_shard1/, failed\norg.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.HttpSolrServer$RemoteSolrException: Expected mime type application/octet-stream but got text/html. <html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\"/>\n<title>Error 500 {msg=SolrCore 'xxxx_shard1' is not available due to init failure: Could not load conf for core xxxx_shard1: Plugin init failure for [schema.xml] fieldType \"text_split_colon\": Plugin init failure for [schema.xml] analyzer/filter: Error loading class 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXX'.
