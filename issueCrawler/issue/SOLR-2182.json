    "description": "I would like to have more distributed capability in the PingRequestHandler healthcheck.  Specifically, the ability for a \"broker\" core to specify a PingRequestHandler that checks /admin/ping of multiple servers as well as it's own \"enable\" file and returns an appropriate error response if any piece of it fails.  The goal of this is so that I can disable any individual shard server and have the broker which queries it return an error to the load balancer.\n\nYou can specify a shards parameter and get a distributed query in the handler, but that doesn't check if any of those shards are disabled.",

I think a fully distributed PRQ would be a good addition, but don't know how to implement it.  I will close this issue soon if nobody else expresses interest in tackling it.\n\nThis is part of an effort to close old issues that I have reported.  Search tag: elyograg2013springclean "
