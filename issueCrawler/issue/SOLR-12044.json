    "description": "(forking from SOLR-11769)  I see places where we could better optimize some of the getDocSet related methods for when we have a MatchAllDocsQuery and some related optimizations.  For example, if the \"live docs\" is instantiated, we can just return that.  But we have to be mindful of the semantics of some of these get/create DocSet methods to be clear about wether a cached result can be returned or not so that the caller knows not to modify it.",
