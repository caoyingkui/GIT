Just seemed as simple to do with a BufferedReader and some readlines, but could have just as easily been subclassed. I am not super familiar with the CSVLoader and haven't had time to look at it. As for the lowercasing, yeah makes sense.\n\nCheers,\nChris "

If you want to create a TokenFilter that does that, it would be great. "
