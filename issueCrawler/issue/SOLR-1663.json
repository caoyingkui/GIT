    "description": "As we get SolrCloud up and running, its going to be helpful to track the load on each server.\n\nWe might add request tracking to SolrCore to help make this easier than looking at each request handler in each core. Number of requests is also only an \"optional\" stat at the RequestHandler level.\n\nThen you can just cycle through each core and grab how many requests it has received, and track that over a given interval.",
