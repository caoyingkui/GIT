What I meant is, that the outer bounds must be in the \"bracket\" that covers the 2^63 limit. So with larger precision steps, also smaller values overflow (but only for longs, ints are safe, as they internally also use longs). ",

This is my favourite solution as it never overflows and we can maybe extend the whole NumericRange to BigInteger  To reduce object creation, it uses a precalculated (1<<shift) array. I had to change the logic a little bit as it was broken with precStep=Integer.MAX_VALUE (OOME).\n\nThe tests pass, I did not test your additional test, but I think it should too.\n\nI will test some range splits tomorrow on the solution you found but as far as i see without trying out, it seem to not work.

Thus, \"nextMinBound>nextMaxBound\" using Bigints, is equivalent to \"nextMinBound>nextMaxBound || lowerWrapped\" using longs.\n\nThe same logic applies to the lower bound. ",

The Bigdecimal approach looks in my eyes much better, the overhead is neglectible (the range split is in no inner loop and object creation is minimized by precalculated 1<<shifts and corresponding masks. This makes the code look much more easy (and its also more easy to understand ant all - I also added more comments).\n\nI also added a test for these extreme values and also to verify that the range split works as exspected (maybe also check shift values vor each bound by also adding to list - will post updated patch later).\n\nThe problem happens when the following is true:\n\n\tthe range contains a minimum bound that is > (MAX_VALUE - 1L<<precisionStep)\n\tthe range contains a maximum bound that is < (MIN_VALUE + 1L<<precisionStep)\n\n\n\nThis affects dates not really and also for doubles its only happening for values near +/-infinity when the lower bound is close to the +infinity or the upper bound is close to -infinity.

I converted Yoniks test and added to TestNumericUtils, which tests more intensive, if the spliutted range is correct: I ensures that all sub range bounds are inside the whole range and that there are no holes in the range. It also checks (important for yoniks fix) that one example range is splitted into the correct sub-ranges. I removed inverse ranges from yoniks patch, as they can never break (NRQ and also splitRange exits early if lower > upper). Also to enable the tests for ranges without holes, the bitset size cannot grow unlimited, so the maximum length of the range is limited to 8192*1024.\n\nI still did not use autoboxing and varargs in the TestNumericUtils, as now this patch should apply easy to 2.9 (with minor changes), so the initial merging works. After committing this to all branches, i would update 3.x and trunk to use varargs and autoboxing, which makes the test more readable.\n\nWithout NumericUtils fix, the new testcases both fail.\n\nI just want to know: Which patch do you prefer?
