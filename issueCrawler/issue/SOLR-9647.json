            "content": "SOLR-9647.patch addresses a case when   CollectionsAPIDistributedZkTest.testCollectionsAPIAddRemoveStress() tries to spawn too many cores, it hangs and flood heap up to OOME. The reasons are: \n\n\twhen many cores register at mbean server, all of them hangs on some synchronized policy check inside jmx.\n\tdefault version buckets are huge by default, but that method even doesn't send updates.\nThis patch introduces solrconfig-slim.xml in stressconf cloud configset without jmx and with trimmed version buckets. It doesn't address the speculations in the comment above. \nOne more change has been required: there is a code branch: pick up the only existing configSet if there is no one specified explicitly. But testCollectionsAPIAddRemoveStress now requires an alternative configSet that's why it's skipped with %50 prob. \n\n\n\nIs it worth to commit?  ",
