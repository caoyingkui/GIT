It's a good idea.\n\ndoes it really matter \"what percentage have X and Y?\" or just \"what percentage have X? what percentage have Y?\"\n\nThe way I've used that script, the question has been: Can I announce that the release is available?  This is answered when all parts of the release are downloadable from some threshold percentage of mirrors, thus \"what percentage have X AND Y\".  As you say, though, this could be performed by running the script in multiple terminals with different paths.  One goal of the script, though, was having just one place to go to get the answer to the question (thus lumping Maven in there too).  Maybe the script could be (eventually - shouldn't block the nice changes you've made here) changed to allow multiple -path options, and print a number instead of a \".\" for presence or \"X\" for absence, representing how many of the files are downloadable at each mirror: \"0\", \"3\", etc.\n\nThanks for working on this, Hoss!
