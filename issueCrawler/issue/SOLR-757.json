    "description": "In Lucene and Solr, query words that are prefix or wildcard or fuzzy do not go through analyzer processing.  This is for well known understood reasons.  However, for my data for a field I might want certain processing to occur.  Lowercasing has already been identified in SOLR-219.  Another which I address in the attached patch file is the ability to remove characters that meet a supplied regular expression.  I've implemented this as part of SolrQueryParser but there should probably be a more thorough plan such as an analyzer chain expressly for the purpose of being applied to prefix, wildcard, and fuzzy queries.",
