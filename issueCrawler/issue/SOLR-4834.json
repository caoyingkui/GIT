    "description": "When using surround query parser, the query terms are not being analyzed. The basic example is lower case, of course. This is probably an intended behaviour, not a bug.\n\nI suggest one more query parameter, which determines whether to do analysis or not. something like this:\n\n_query_:\"{!surround df=myfield analyze=true}SpinPoint 7n GB18030\"",

For\nindexing texts to be queried by the Surround language, we recommend that you use a\nlowercasing analyzer that removes only the most frequently occurring punctuations.\n\nNevertheless, to use an analyzer for the queries, one can override some of the protected methods of the Surround QueryParser to use the analyzer.
