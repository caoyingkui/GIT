It's nice to make such a flag configurable in the client's software to ease upgrades.",

I don't recall if the upgrade was to use a completely different Solr cluster \u2013 I think so.  That would make this feature useful but if the Solr cluster is to be upgraded in a rolling fashion in-place, then I can appreciate this toggle may be of no use.  \n\nIf it's felt this would be useless due to stability of the binary format then we can just close as won't-fix.  I have no strong feelings.  I didn't intend to do this work; it was mostly an idea I've had that's appropriate for a \"newdev\" label. ",
