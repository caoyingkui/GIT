I'm not sure how good results will be on average yet (maybe I can enlist Christian to help investigate).\n\nSo as a test I just added a boolean option, which if enabled, keeps all han/hiragana/katakana marked as \"Chinese/Japanese\" (uses the 15924 Japanese code, but I overrode the toString to try to prevent confusion).\n\nSeems to work ok: some trivial snippets from smartcn and kuromoji are analyzed fine, and testRandomStrings is happy  ",
