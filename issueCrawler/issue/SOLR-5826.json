    "description": "As stated in http://markmail.org/thread/a477kyxsp5xrusdu there're scenarios where an application communicating with Solr needs to not loose requests (especially update/indexing requests) that may fail because Solr instance / cluster is not reachable for some time.\nFor such scenarios it may helpful to have a wrapping SolrServer which can cache (in a FIFO queue, so that they get executed in order) requests when the Solr endpoint is not reachable and execute them as soon as it's reachable again.",
