Eg then I can store my suggest FST in a RAMDir.",

Storing to a Lucene Directory would be possible if we exposed the internal FSTCompletion (or FST). No problem with adding a facade method for doing all this, it's just a matter of choice if we want to stick to Lookup API or add more methods to a specific subclass. ",
