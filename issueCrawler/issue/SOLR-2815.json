I took the example schema and added a field called \"in-stock\" to go along with the existing \"inStock\" field.  \n\nA query for http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=*:*&fl=id,in-stock throws back an error saying the field \"in\" can't be found.  \n\nI can sort of work around it by quoting the field name as \"in-stock\":\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=*:*&fl=id,%22in-stock%22&rows=1\n\nHowever the output is still off:\n\n<doc>\n<str name=\"id\">GB18030TEST</str>\n<str name=\"\"in-stock\"\">in-stock</str>\n</doc>\n\nIn looking at it, I think the dash character causes the field name to be interpreted as an actual function!",
