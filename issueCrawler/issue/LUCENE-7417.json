To reproduce, change the test that was committed for LUCENE-7231 to use a MultiPhraseQuery. It results in the same error\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Less than 2 subSpans.size():1\n\nI have a patch including a test against branch_5.x, it just needs to go through legal before I can post it.",
