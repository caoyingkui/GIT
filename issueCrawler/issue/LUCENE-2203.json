I only investigated this enough to determine that it wasn't my LUCENE-2194 performance improvement commit that broke these, they were broken with the previous revision too. we should probably get to the bottom of these.

The files you are downloading are very large and might be an issues for some folks. The filesize is over 70MB which is a lot for a test. I need to thing about this a little and come up with some suggestions. ",

So I feel fine with leaving these commented out for now and also proceeding with performance improvements. ",
