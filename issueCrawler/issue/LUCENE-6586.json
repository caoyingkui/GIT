Yeah, Git is there for convenience, JIRAs are how we\ntrack code changes, the \"usual\" method of drawing attention to a code problem\nis to attach a patch to a JIRA.\n\nI noticed that the \"How To Contribute\" page really doesn't mention this, I'll see\nif I can update it.\n\nThanks for both noticing the original problem and your persistence bringing it\nto our attention!\n "

            "content": "Hi Michael,\n\nI tried to write a small test case and realized that there is no input that leads to a wrong token.\nsubstCount is only used to decide how large the original input was, because some suffixes are only stripped if the token has a minimum length.\n\n\nif ( ( buffer.length() + substCount > 5 ) &&\n      buffer.substring( buffer.length() - 2, buffer.length() ).equals( \"nd\" ) )\n    {\n      buffer.delete( buffer.length() - 2, buffer.length() );\n    }\n\n\n\nHowever, every substitution leaves at least one character. For the bug to take effect, there has to be a substitution before the one that sets substCount to 2 (instead of incrementing it by 2).\nSo we have\n\n\t2 characters that where left by the (at least 2) substitutions\n\tthe suffix  \"nd\"\n\tsubstCount, which was set to 2\nThat sums up to 6 , which is greater than 5\n\n\n\nThe other conditions that check on substCount work the same, except they check for greater than 4.\n\nTherefore, there is no token that triggers any wrong behaviour.\n\nStill, I think the typo should be fixed, because it might be copied to a place where it has an effect.
