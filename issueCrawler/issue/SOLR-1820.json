    "description": "In Solr 1.4, we deprecated support for 'custom encodings embedded inside unicode'.\n\nThis is where the analyzer in lucene itself did encoding conversions, its better to just let \nanalyzers be analyzers, and leave encoding conversion to Java.\n\nIn order to move to Lucene 3.x, we need to remove this deprecated support, and instead\nissue an error in the factories if you try to do this (instead of a warning).",
