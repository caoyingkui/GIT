    "description": "Hello Everyone, \n\nHope you are all doing well.\nRecently I have trying to make work a solr schemaless configuration with DIH(mysql 5.6). After working on it around 4-5 Hrs I realized that schemaless with DIH wont work. It might be my assumptions and chances are any of you might know a way to make them together work. If so, please let me know how, if not can this be treated as the improvement?\n\nBest regards",
