As first step, the JIRA is to design telemetry for field facet.\n\nExample: (using films)\n\n$curl 'http://localhost:8228/solr/films/select?debugQuery=true&facet.field=genre&facet.field=directed_by&facet=true&indent=on&q=*:*&wt=json'\n...\n    \"facet-trace\":{\n      \"elapse\":1,\n      \"sub-facet\":[{\n          \"processor\":\"SimpleFacets\",\n          \"elapse\":1,\n          \"action\":\"field facet\",\n          \"maxThreads\":0,\n          \"sub-facet\":[{\n              \"method\":\"FC\",\n              \"inputDocSetSize\":1100,\n              \"field\":\"genre\",\n              \"numBuckets\":213},\n            {\n              \"method\":\"FC\",\n              \"inputDocSetSize\":1100,\n              \"field\":\"directed_by\",\n              \"numBuckets\":1053}]}]},\n...",

If both faceting components are used at the same time, does this work?\n\tit seems like one would really want elapsed time per facet.field (i.e per-sub-facet)?\n\tinstead of changing \"long elapse\" to \"Long elapse\", perhaps just use \"-1\" to detect if it's been set?\n\t\"fdebugCurrentTermCount\" is oddly named... perhaps just \"fdebug\"?\n\n ",

If both faceting components are used at the same time, does this work?\nThat's good point. Let me separate them.\n\nit seems like one would really want elapsed time per facet.field (i.e per-sub-facet)?\nI think so, particularly when the query has multiple field faceting, it's good to know which field faceting causes problem.
