    "description": "On some machines that have weird network settings, it is possible that InetAddress.getLocalHost() throws an UnknownHostException in _info.jsp in the admin console.  This prevents the entire admin console from coming up.  \n\nThe fix is to catch the exception and use a host string of \"unknown host\" or something to that effect.  \n\nPatch shortly.",
