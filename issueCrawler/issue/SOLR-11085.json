            "content": "This patch:\n\n\tPasses ZkController to the TriggerFactory to avoid running into SOLR-11370. Similarily, triggers use the ZkController directly instead of accessing it via container.getZkController.\n\tExecutePlanAction always calls collection APIs in async mode and uses the request id to poll for completion of tasks.\n\tFixes a bug in Preference where the setApproxVal method was trying to access metrics for non-live nodes leading to NPE.\n\tScheduledTriggers:\n\t\n\t\tadds more protection against overseer shutdown\n\t\tScheduledTriggers fires listeners for event stage STARTED after the event is enqueued successfully to ZK\n\t\tScheduledTriggers waits for pending tasks requested by ExecutePlanAction before trying to compute/execute the plan again\n\t\n\t\n\tSharedFSAutoReplicaFailoverTest now restarts overseer sometimes and removes the nocommit added by SOLR-10397\n\n ",
