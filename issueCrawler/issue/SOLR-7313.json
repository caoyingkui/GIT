    "description": "Right now the request routing logic is divided into a number of places viz. SolrDispatchFilter, DistributedUpdateProcessor, ShardHandler etc.\n\nIt is also quite inefficient in many places e.g. while resolving a collection name to a core name, solr prefers a leader (any leader) for a update request even if that leader isn't the right one.\n\nWe should try to refactor all these routing decisions into one place.",
