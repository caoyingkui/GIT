    "description": "While testing my large scale Tika/SolrCell indexing (great work on /extraction guys, really really appreciate it) on my 40M image dataset, I was pulling my frickin' hair out trying to figure out why the TesseractOCR extracted content wasn't actually making it into the index. Well I figured it out lol (many many System.out.printlns later) - it's the disabling of div tags (=>ignored) in the default solrconfig.xml. This basically renders TesseractOCR output in SolrCell useless since it is surrounded by a div tag.",

There is probably a workaround though to be done in Solr, which is to flush the current field builder information if it hasn't been flushed yet. Going to whip up a patch, see if it fixes it, and if so, throw it up. ",

The whole setup ffor a new document is already done by the constructor.\nThe startDocument setup looks like the original code writer wanted to \"reuse\" instances. But in fact this is never done (I checked extraction and morphlines).\nI will attach a patch that removes the startDocument() and adds documentation to javadocs that you can only process one document.
