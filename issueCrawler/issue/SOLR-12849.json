    "description": "This is a weird one.\n\nFired up a cloud example, server built from branch_7x code (7.6.0-SNAPSHOT)\nCreated four collections with the _default configset \u2013 foo, foo2, bar, bar2.\nCreated four aliases, here's the contents of aliases.json:\n\n    {\"collection\":{\n        \"b_s\":\"bar\",\n        \"b_m\":\"bar2,bar\",\n        \"f_s\":\"foo\",\n        \"f_m\":\"foo2,foo\"}}\n\n\n\nThis curl command will fail, with \"Could not find collection : b_s\" as the message:\n\ncurl -XPOST -s localhost:8983/solr/b_s/select -d 'q=*:*&rows=0&collection=b_s'\n\n\n\nThat seems like a bug, but it's not the whole story.  Here's where things get weird.  The following two commands will NOT fail:\n\ncurl -XPOST -s localhost:8983/solr/b_m/select -d 'q=*:*&rows=0&collection=b_m'\ncurl -XGET -s \"localhost:8983/solr/b_s/select?q=*:*&rows=0&collection=b_s\"\n\n\n\nThe first one is very similar to the one that fails, except it uses an alias pointing at multiple collections instead of an alias pointing at one collection.  The second is effectively identical to the command that fails, except it's a GET rather than a POST \u2013 the parameters are part of the URL rather than being specified in the request body.",
