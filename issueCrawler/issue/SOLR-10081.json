If you haven't come across Quepid before then this blog post is great to get started.\n\nRegards,\n\nChristine\n\n\n\nPS: Upayavira and Alan Woodward - would you have any thoughts to share here perhaps e.g. based on your work with the Solr Admin UI and/or your experience with Quepid?

Then users could understand how ltr work.\n\n\n\ntraining data(WEB UI) -> feature -> model -> ltr query \n\nRegards,\nLI ",
