The \"score\" variable is set in org.apache.lucene.search.spell.SpellChecker.suggestSimilar.\n\nIn working with the spellchecker, if setting spellcheck.count to a high value (like 100), I've often gotten results far down the list with a lot more hits than the ones early in the list but the word is obviously a less-likely correction than the ones higher up.\n\nPerhaps this old ticket can be closed?
