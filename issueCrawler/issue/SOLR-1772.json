They thought this was equivalent to not sending it any value.  I haven't verified this first hand but I believe it.  Perhaps it would make sense for all fields types to ignore an empty string by default, and then if for some weird reason I can't contemplate, you could disable it for a certain field.  Does that make sense? "

They thought this was equivalent to not sending it any value. I haven't verified this first hand but I believe it.\n\nNope: there are many use cases for both strings and numbers where you may need to \"skip\" a value in a multiValued field \u2013 parallel arrays and such. ... it's actually one main situations we still have where IntField comes in handy (besides just supporting completely legacy Lucene indexes) "
