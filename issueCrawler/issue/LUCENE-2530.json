    "description": "Before docsEnum.read() can be called a BulkResult instance must be allocated for it (it == the default implementation of that method).\nThis is done by calling docsEnum.getBulkResult(). Failure to call this method before read() is called results in a NullPointerException.\nIt is somewhat counterintuitive to \"get\" the results of an operation before calling said operation.\nMaybe this method should be renamed to something more definite-sounding like obtainBulkResult() or prepareBulkResult() ?",
