    "description": "I've seen a fair number of users customizing solr.in.* scripts to make changes to their Solr installs.  I think the documentation suggests this, though I haven't confirmed.\n\nOne possible problem with this is that we might make changes in those scripts which such a user would want in their setup, but if they replace the script with the one in the new version, they will lose their customizations.\n\nI propose instead that we have the startup script look for and utilize a user customization script, in a similar manner to linux init scripts that look for /etc/default/packagename, but are able to function without it.  I'm not entirely sure where the script should live or what it should be called.  One idea is server/etc/userconfig.{sh,cmd} ... but I haven't put a lot of thought into it yet.\n\nIf the internal behavior of our scripts is largely replaced by a small java app as detailed in SOLR-7043, then the same thing should apply there \u2013 have a config file for a user to specify settings, but work perfectly if that config file is absent.",

However, we should add mention about doing a diff with the new bin/solr.in.sh to see if any new goodies have been introduced to that file that you may need to include / override with your customized /var/solr/solr.in.sh when doing the upgrade.

All the other things in there are commented ... so now it makes a lot more sense as to why it would be set up the way it is.  I think those default options should be in the main solr script, and it should be possible to override them in an additional script, with a sample version of that additional script provided in the download.

I've thought about placing those sample files in server/etc instead, since that directory already exists. I'm open to discussion on both the filenames and the location.  I like the idea of an etc directory at the top level ... if most of what a user might want to change in server/etc is configurable by environment variables in etc (I think we're probably there or mostly there now), we can hopefully keep beginners from messing with the jetty config and permanent scripts directly.\n\nThe main solr script should contain sensible defaults for the variables that can be overridden in the startup environment, then read that config script if it exists.

As-such, this will over-ride any existing environment variable definition for this, leading to a bad user experience.  My preference would be for the default settings to be embedded within the bin/solr script as conditionals (i.e. only define these vars if they are not already defined).  The bin/solr script already does this for a ton of stuff, so this approach is very consistent \u2013 a good thing.  At that point, we can comment out everything that isn't already commented out in solr.in.sh.\n\nPerhaps the issue title could be renamed to \"The default solr.in.sh shouldn't do anything; add more defaults to bin/solr\" if we agree on this.
