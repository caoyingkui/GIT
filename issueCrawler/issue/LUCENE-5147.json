    "description": "Today the API returns a List which suggests there's an ordering going on. This may be confusing if one uses FacetsAccumulator.create which results in a MultiFacetsAccumulator, and then the order of the results does not correspond to the order of the requests.\n\nRather than trying to enforce ordering, a simple mapping may be better even for consuming apps since they will be able to easily lookup desired results.",

I don't see how much value it brings, plus an app can easily put the results in a map and lookup requests:\n\n\nMap<FacetRequest,FacetResult> results = new HashMap<>();\nfor (FacetResult fres : facetResults) {\n  results.put(fres.getFacetRequest(), fres);\n}\n\n\n\nResolving as Won't Fix for now, if this will be a problem we can reopen.
