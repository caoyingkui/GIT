    "description": "BBoxStrategy needs better tests before I'm comfortable seeing it in 4x.  Specifically it should use random rectangles based validation (ones that may cross the dateline), akin to the other tests.  And I think I see an equals/hashcode bug to be fixed in there too.\n\nOne particular thing I'd like to see added is how to handle a zero-area case for AreaSimilarity.  I think an additional feature in which you declare a minimum % area (relative to the query shape) would be good.\n\nIt should be possible for the user to combine rectangle center-point to query shape center-point distance sorting as well.  I think it is but I need to make sure it's possible without having to index a separate center point field.\n\nAnother possibility (probably not to be addressed here) is a minimum ratio between width/height, perhaps 10%.  A long but nearly no height line should not be massively disadvantaged relevancy-wise to an equivalently long diagonal road that has a square bbox.",

This strategy never truly supported Overlaps even if it didn't complain.  If someone wants it; create an issue and ideally upload the code too \n\n\n\nNext up is Similarity testing. ",

            "content": "Another change to the API is, I think it's not needed to have a BBoxSimilarity interface.  DistanceSimilarity can be tossed, and so could BBoxSimilarityValueSource.  Instead, AreaSimilarity can be ShapeAreaValueSource that takes a ValueSource that produces shapes from it's objectVal(doc).  This is in the same vein as DistanceToShapeValueSource. This underscores the pluggability with, say, SerializedDVStrategy with ValueSource's.  It's plausible it will be faster to decode 4 numbers from a contiguous byte array than have to retrieve a number 4 times via DocValues.  And the code shouldn't have to change accordingly \u2013 it's plug and play.\n\nContinuing this (definitely a separate JIRA issue), looking at the TODOs: these two methods move to SpatialStrategy:\n\n  /**\n   * Provides access to each rectangle per document as a ValueSource in which\n   * {@link org.apache.lucene.queries.function.FunctionValues#objectVal(int)} returns a {@link\n   * Shape}.\n   */ //TODO raise to SpatialStrategy\n  public ValueSource makeShapeValueSource() {\n    return new BBoxValueSource(this);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public ValueSource makeDistanceValueSource(Point queryPoint, double multiplier) {\n    //TODO if makeShapeValueSource gets lifted to the top; this could become a generic impl.\n    return new DistanceToShapeValueSource(makeShapeValueSource(), queryPoint, multiplier, ctx);\n  }\n\n ",

It's an optional way to handle point queries, which without this would basically match everything with the same score since there is no intersection area.\n\tAdded generic ShapeAreaValueSource (with geoArea boolean option) that basically just calls shape.getArea(). This is a good way of handling sorting the results of a point query for indexed rects.\n\tsetPrecisionType is gone; instead I'm trying a new scheme in which you get and set a FieldType.  See LUCENE-5802.  Use of DocValues is configurable and enabled by default.\n\n\n\nI think it's probably ready to be committed now. ",
