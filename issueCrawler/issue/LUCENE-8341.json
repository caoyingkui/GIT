This is the last step\n    towards making soft deletes as powerful as hard deltes since now the\n    number of document can be read from commit points without opening a\n    full blown reader. This also allows merge posliies to make decisions\n    without requiring an NRT reader to get the relevant statistics. This\n    change doesn't enforce any field to be used as soft deletes and the statistic\n    is maintained per segment.",
