Internally it always create either 'TopFieldCollector' or 'TopScoreDocCollector' which does not allow limit as 0. \n\nSo if limit should be zero then there should be a way that 'TotalHitCountCollector' should be initialized. \n\nBetter way would be to provide an api which takes query and collector as inputs just like 'drillSideways.search(filterQuery, totalHitCountCollector)'.",

Code fix and test executes as expected like before fix assertion fails and after fix test passes but the problem that I had is that sometimes test will not pass in all cases with error ' java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: dimension \"b\" was not indexed into field \"$facets'. This is happening randomly with no fixed step to reproduce and I am not sure why . "
