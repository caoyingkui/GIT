    "description": "A properly running Solr server with a very clean configuration may have absolutely no messages logged at WARN or ERROR.  When this happens, clicking on the logging tab produces a screen with no messages and a spinning cursor, which looks like the page is hung.\n\nIt has come to my attention that there is a \"No events available\" message already in the UI, but it doesn't work.  I can think of two ways to fix the problem:\n\n\n\tFix the detection in the UI so that the \"No events available\" message actually works.  Also, the spinner could be removed.  The spinner is a big reason that the page looks broken.\n\tSolr could log a \"startup complete\" message at WARN so that there is always something to display.",

            "content": "At solr/webapp/web/partials/logging.html#L45, there is this bit of HTML:\n\n\n      <tfoot>\n        <tr ng-show=\"events.length==0\">\n          <td colspan=\"4\">No Events available</td>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n\n\n\nThis is a mismatched element (<tfoot> closed by </thead), but that's not causing the problem. \n\nIn solr/webapp/web/css/angular/logging.css#L179, there is this bit of CSS:\n\n\n#content #logging #viewer .has-data tfoot\n{\n  display: none;\n}\n\n\n\nThat .has-data is a class that's given to the table in the aforementioned logging.html, and since the <tfoot> is part of the same table, the rule says not to show the tfoot element at all. The construct hasData is a real JQuery function, but I can't see that it's being used here.\n\nI think that we could simplify this quite a bit by removing the CSS rule - in my testing removing it makes the \"No Events available\" text appear, but it disappears as soon as there is a log event to show.\n\nI also think we should remove the spinner since it indicates that something is in progress instead of what it was intended to convey, which is that a refresh is happening regularly to check for new log events.\n\nI'll cook up a quick patch in a few minutes.
