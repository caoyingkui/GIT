    "description": "The current version of forbiddenapis misses to add the new java.time APIs of Java 8, Some of the methods use default Locale or default Timezone.\n\nUntil a new version of forbidden-apis is released, I would like to add those APIs to the Trunk (Java 8) base.txt signatures list. We already have some code in trunk using java.time (IndexWriter logging), so we should take care of that.",

            "content": "Forbidden-Apis 2.0 was released a minute ago. I will provide a patch that reverts the last commit and also cleans up Ant build to use the new \"arbitrary ANT resource\" feature for signatures.\n\nhttps://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis/wiki/Changes\n\n\nThis is the major 2.0 release of the forbidden-apis plugin. The main new feature is native support for the Gradle build system (minimum requirement is Gradle 2.3). But also Apache Ant and Apache Maven build systems got improved support: Ant can now load signatures from arbitrary resources by using a new XML element <signatures></signatures> that may contain any valid ANT resource, e.g., ivy's cache-filesets or plain URLs. Apache Maven now supports to load signatures files as artifacts from your repository or Maven Central (new signaturesArtifacts Mojo property). "
