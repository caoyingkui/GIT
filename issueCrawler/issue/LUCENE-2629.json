I would have thought that the gennorm2 program should generate the file format that works, no matter what machine it is run on.\n\nNo doubt there are complex reasons for this design weirdness.  I know that sadly, some people have to still deal with EBCDIC.\n ",

I would have thought that the gennorm2 program should generate the file format that works, no matter what machine it is run on.\n\nI could be wrong, but I think the reason ICU's data files are endian-dependent is because they are designed to be very very quickly mapped into memory\n(e.g. the speed at which the underlying character property data can be mapped into memory so that java.lang.Character becomes useful is sensitive) ",
