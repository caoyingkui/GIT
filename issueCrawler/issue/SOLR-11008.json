            "content": "From the log, it looks as though what's happening is the metric tests are being run before the core has properly finished initialising (it's still loading various spellchecker indices), so the core metrics haven't been registered yet.  The fix, I think, is to add a call to h.getCoreContainer().waitForLoadingCoresToFinish(timeout) in the beforeClass() method.  We could also use a lighter solrconfig here, given that we're not actually using the spell checker in the tests anywhere. ",
