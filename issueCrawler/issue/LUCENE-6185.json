However, this merging logic involves a TopFieldCollector which is collected out-of-order. I think it should just use TopDocs.merge?",

            "content": "Hmm one problem with TopDocs.merge is that it doesn't re-base the docIDs.  Instead, it sets shardIndex for each hit.  I think this patch should sometimes fail tests, when newSearcher swaps in an ExecutorService?\n\nTopDocs.merge does this so that you can merge across indices that sum to > 2.1B docs.  But in this usage, the number of docs will be < 2.1B ... so maybe we need an option to TopDocs.merge to rebase?  Or we rebase afterwards in IndexSearcher? "

So all is good.\n\nAnd then when we call TopDocs.merge, we provide the top docs instances in the same order as leaves have been provided to IndexSearcher.search so tie-breaking by shard id has the same effect as tie-breaking by doc id?\n\nYes, this is important: earlier shard wins in TopDocs.merge.
