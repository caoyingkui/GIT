    "description": "I needed CharArraySet.clear() for something I was working on in Solr in a tokenstream.\n\ninstead I ended up using CharArrayMap<Boolean> because it supported .clear()\n\nit would be better to use a set though, currently it will throw UOE for .clear() because AbstractSet will call iterator.remove() which throws UOE.\n\nIn Solr, the very similar CharArrayMap.clear() looks like this:\n\n  @Override\n  public void clear() {\n    count = 0;\n    Arrays.fill(keys,null);\n    Arrays.fill(values,null);\n  }\n\n\n\nI think we can do a similar thing as long as we throw UOE for the UnmodifiableCharArraySet\n\nwill submit a patch later tonight (unless someone is bored and has nothing better to do)",
