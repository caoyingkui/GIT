DirReader has hasChanges and IW has changeCount.  I think these classes should notify the SIS when there are in fact changes; this will fix the case Simon hit on fixing LUCENE-2082 when the NRT reader thought there were changes, but in fact there weren't because IW simply committed the exact SIS it already had.",
