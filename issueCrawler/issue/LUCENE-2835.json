    "description": "For some MultiTermQueries, like RangeQuery we have a FieldCacheRangeFilter etc (in this case its particularly optimized).\n\nBut in the general case, since LUCENE-2784 we can now have a rewrite method to rewrite any MultiTermQuery \nusing the FieldCache, because MultiTermQuery's getEnum no longer takes IndexReader but Terms, and all the \nFilteredTermsEnums are now just real TermsEnum decorators.\n\nIn cases like low frequency queries this is actually slower (I think this has been shown for numeric ranges before too),\nbut for the really high-frequency ones like especially ugly wildcards, regexes, fuzzies this can be many times faster \nusing the FieldCache instead, since all the terms are in RAM and automaton can blast through them quicker.",
