My summary of the new EdgeNGramTokenFilter bug is on the thread here: http://markmail.org/message/7dkd6edz2p7fat2h.\n\nAs of the changes committed on this issue, EdgeNGramTokenFilter passes through as-is the position increment on its first emitted token for a given input token.  When the input token has a position increment of 0, e.g. for synonyms, and this is the first output token, EdgeNGramTokenFilter is then guilty of producing a stream whose first token has a position increment of 0.
