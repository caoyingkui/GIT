    "description": "Twice on Uwe's Jenkins, DistribCursorPagingTest has paged through a small number of indexed docs and retrieved one fewer doc than the number of indexed docs.  Both of these failures were on trunk on Windows:\n\nhttp://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-trunk-Windows/3708/\nhttp://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-trunk-Windows/3713/  \n\nI've also seen this twice on trunk on my OS X laptop (out of 875 trials).\n\nNone of the seeds have reproduced for me.\n\nAll the failures were using either Lucene41 or Lucene42 codec",
