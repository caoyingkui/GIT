            "content": "Here is a patch. I removed the notes about removing TermValComparator as it is the only way to sort a field that has binary doc values.\n\nOther than that:\n\n\tit can now sort missing values last\n\tyou can override the terms and docsWithField that are used for comparison\n\tyou can override the detection for null values. This is typically useful if there is a sentinel value that represents null.\n\n\n\nI didn't add support for custom missing values as I'm not sure it is a common need on binary/string content but it is easy to implement on top of this comparator by overriding getDocsWithField to return a Bits.MatchAllBits set and wrap the binary dv returned by getBinaryDocValues.
