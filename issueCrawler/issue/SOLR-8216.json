    "description": "I am trying to use CloudSolrClient to query information about the Solr server including version information. I found /admin/info/system and it seems to provide the information I am looking for. However, it looks like CloudSolrClient cannot query /admin/info since INFO_HANDLER_PATH [1] is not part of the ADMIN_PATHS in CloudSolrClient.java [2]. Was this possibly missed as part of SOLR-4943?\n\nAs a side note, ZK_PATH also isn't listed in ADMIN_PATHS. I'm not sure what issues that could cause. Is there a reason that ADMIN_PATHS in CloudSolrClient would be different than the paths in CommonParams [1]?\n\n[1] https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/params/CommonParams.java#L168\n[2] https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/impl/CloudSolrClient.java#L808",

Create an instance of that object for each Solr that you're running.  Here's some sample code:\n\n\n  SolrClient sysClient = new HttpSolrClient(\"http://server:port/solr\");\n  SolrQuery sysQuery = new SolrQuery();\n  sysQuery.setRequestHandler(\"/admin/info/system\");\n\t\t\n  QueryResponse rsp = sysClient.query(sysQuery);\n  String os = (String) rsp.getResponse().findRecursive(\"system\", \"name\");\n  String ver = (String) rsp.getResponse().findRecursive(\"system\", \"version\");\n  System.out.println(\"OS: \" + os + \" \" + ver);\n\n ",

I can grab the live nodes from CloudSolrClient and loop through them to get the info for each node individually.\n\nIn CloudSolrClient ADMIN_PATHS is really only for admin paths that are cluster wide and NOT node specific. This explains why /admin/info/system and the LukeRequestHandler are not listed there.\n\nI can close this JIRA as invalid since the assumption of /admin/info/system being for the entire cluster was wrong.
