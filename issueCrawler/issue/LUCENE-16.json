But, if you want to create a new index you \nshouldn't know if it exists or not, you only have to said 'I want a new index in this path' and, I \nthink, the writer must do all the work.\n\nWith this in mind, I think that a posible solution can \nbe that the indexwriter find out if the directory exists or create it.\n\nPlease comments to my \nidea.
