The updateLog hard code the default sync level is SyncLevel.FLUSH.\nIf user want to use the other levels, have to rewrite the RunUpdateProcess, to set the level.\nAt best, user can set it in the solrconfig.xml, that it is easy to control and use.\n\nBTW, transaction log is very important for solr cloud, at best, invoke the sync to make sure kernel memory submit into the disk to avoid some corner case that maybe damage transaction log.",

The danger is when the whole shard goes out at once and all of the replicas lose updates - fsync every update is going to be fairly expensive to cover that kind of rare disaster (not only did the whole shard go down, but every node is missing some updates), but it should be available with config.

            "content": "Agree, we can recover from replicas, and all of replicas goes out for one shard that is low probability. I suggest the leader server implement the high strictly level fsync, and the replicas can defined FLUSH. As you mention, maybe only single node case. However can be configurable that is more usability. Will it apply the patch in the new version?  "
