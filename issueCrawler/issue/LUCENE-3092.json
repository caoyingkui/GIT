With all our pausing/unpausing magic there's no guarantee merge will end on the same thread it started on.\n\nStuff like FlushPolicy could take information about concurrent merges and hold of flushes for a little while if memory allows it etc.\nCoordinating access to shared resource (IO subsystem) with events is very awkward. Ok, your FlushPolicy receives events from MergePolicy and holds flushes during merge. Now, when a flush is in progress, should FlushPolicy notify MergePolicy so it can hold its merges?\nIt goes downhill from there. What if FP and MP fire events simultaneously?  What should other listeners do?\n\nTry looking at a bigger picture. Merges are not your problem. Neither are flushes. Your problem is that several threads try to take their dump on disk simultaneously (for whatever reason, you don't really care). So what we need is an arbitration mechanism for Directory writes. A mechanism located presumably @ Directory level (eg, we don't need to throttle anything when writing to RAMDir).\n\nOne possible implementation is that we add a constructor parameter to FSDirectory specifying desired level of IO parallelism, and then it keeps track of its IndexOutputs and stalls writes selectively. We can also add 'expectedWriteSize' to IOContext, so the Directory may favor shorter writes over bigger ones. Instead of 'expectedWriteSize' we can use 'priority'. ",

With all our pausing/unpausing magic there's no guarantee merge will end on the same thread it started on.\n\nYou're absolutely right that tying them to threads is not a good idea, but I couldn't disagree more that this is an issue with an Event model.  Yes we should be wary of what information we make available in Events (I only added Threads to the Events in my patch because I was showing a simple alternative to Mike's initial impl).  But to say Events are fragile and therefore we shouldn't pursue a listener pattern seems a big leap.  Many large applications use event listeners and I don't think they're wrong.\n\nIt goes downhill from there. What if FP and MP fire events simultaneously?  What should other listeners do?\n\nGood point.  Again, those are issues we need to resolve (one way applications tend to address this is event queues).\n\nTry looking at a bigger picture. Merges are not your problem. Neither are flushes.\n\nYou're right, neither merges nor flushes are the problem.  We have a series of components in Lucene; Directories, IndexWriter, MergeScheduler etc, and we have some crosscutting concerns such as merges themselves.  We should strive to decouple these components where possible and think big picture.\n\nI agree with your suggestions for how we can solve the problem here now for NRTCachingDirectory, but I think we can do better for the longer term.\n ",
