    "description": "The new dimensional points implementations for geo distance, polygon, shape filtering are substantially faster and creates a smaller index than the postings based GeoPointField.  They also offer nearest neighbor search, which GeoPointField doesn't.\n\nI think we should deprecate GeoPointField and focus on the points implementations.\n\nWe have still other legacy postings based geo implementations but I think we should keep them for now since they have functionality that points doesn't yet have: the ability to index a shape and search for shapes overlapping the indexed shapes.",

            "content": "+1    I believe GeoPointField also never quite got distance sorting added.  I could sense development halted once LatLonPoint started showing it was going to win out.\n\nHey Nicholas Knize the GeoPointField was really excellent work \u2013 the ideal geo field that was based on an inverted index.  Maybe someone out there would find it useful who either has an old Lucene index or who wishes to port to something else like LevelDB. ",
