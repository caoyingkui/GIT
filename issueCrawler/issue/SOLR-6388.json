            "content": "FYI: This update was needed for:\n\n\nHallo Apache Solr Users,\n\nthe Apache Lucene PMC wants to make the users of Solr aware of  the following issue:\n\nApache Solr versions 4.8.0, 4.8.1, 4.9.0 bundle Apache POI 3.10-beta2 with its binary release tarball. This version (and all previous ones) of Apache POI are vulnerable to the following issues:\n\nCVE-2014-3529: XML External Entity (XXE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser\nType: Information disclosure\nDescription: Apache POI uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...). Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allows remote attackers to bypass security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference.\n\nCVE-2014-3574: XML Entity Expansion (XEE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser\nType: Denial of service\nDescription: Apache POI uses Java's XML components and Apache Xmlbeans to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...). Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks (\"XML bombs\"), which allows remote hackers to consume large amounts of CPU resources.\n\nThe Apache POI PMC released a bugfix version (3.10.1) today.\n\nSolr users are affected by these issues, if they enable the \"Apache Solr Content Extraction Library (Solr Cell)\" contrib module from the folder \"contrib/extraction\" of the release tarball.\n\nUsers of Apache Solr are strongly advised to keep the module disabled if they don't use it. Alternatively, users of Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, or 4.9.0 can update the affected libraries by replacing the vulnerable JAR files in the distribution folder. Users of previous versions have to update their Solr release first, patching older versions is impossible.\n\nTo replace the vulnerable JAR files follow these steps:\n\n\n\tDownload the Apache POI 3.10.1 binary release: http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-3.10.1\n\tUnzip the archive\n\tDelete the following files in your \"solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib\" folder: poi-3.10-beta2.jar, poi-ooxml-3.10-beta2.jar, poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10-beta2.jar, poi-scratchpad-3.10-beta2.jar, xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar\n\tCopy the following files from the base folder of the Apache POI distribution to the \"solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib\" folder: poi-3.10.1-20140818.jar, poi-ooxml-3.10.1-20140818.jar, poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10.1-20140818.jar, poi-scratchpad-3.10.1-20140818.jar\n\tCopy \"xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar\" from POI's \"ooxml-lib/\" folder to the \"solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib\" folder.\n\tVerify that the \"solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib\" no longer contains any files with version number \"3.10-beta2\".\n\tVerify that the folder contains one xmlbeans JAR file with version 2.6.0.\n\n\n\nIf you just want to disable extraction of Microsoft Office documents, delete the files above and don't replace them. \"Solr Cell\" will automatically detect this and disable Microsoft Office document extraction.\n\nComing versions of Apache Solr will have the updated libraries bundled.\n\nHappy Searching and Extracting,\nThe Apache Lucene Developers\n\nPS: Thanks to Stefan Kopf, Mike Boufford, and Christian Schneider for reporting these issues!
