    "description": "I was playing with merge throttling and discovered that our\nSimpleRateLimiter is throttling far more than requested; e.g. I asked\nfor 50 MB/sec merge throttling, but it throttled at more like 8\nMB/sec.\n\nThe problem is we are calling Thread.sleep on too-small (< 1 msec)\ntimes; on ordinary (non-real-time) JVMs, anything less than 1 msec is\nrounded up to 1 msec.  Also, System.nanoTime() is somewhat costly.\n\nTo fix this, I think we should aggregate the incoming byte count,\nuntil it crosses a threshold of enough bytes to warrant pausing.",

            "content": "Here's a simple patch: it just pushes responsibility of adding up\npending (thread-private) bytes to the caller, i.e. caller should not\ncall RateLimiter.pause until it has written more than 5 msec worth of\nbytes.\n\nI played with another approach of doing aggregation inside\nRateLimiter.pause using an AtomicLong, but it quickly gets hairy, and\nat least the solution I iterated too was not scheduler-friendly (it\nwould pause all threads once the IO rate was exceeded), vs this patch\nwhich will \"take turns\" pausing the threads.

I dont think that should block fixing this, but its just something to think about.\n\nMaybe later we can add unit tests (like some kind of MockRateLimiter) to test the actual logic without depending on wall-clock time?
