The only missing part is that it doesn't minValue and maxValue filter. \nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/events/select?q=*:*&json.facet={ \n   categories:{ \n     type : terms, \n     field : accountId, \n     numBuckets: true, \n     facet:\n{ \n       sum : \"sum(timeSpent)\" \n       // it would be great if we support minValue, maxValue to do filter here \n     }\n \n   } \n }",
