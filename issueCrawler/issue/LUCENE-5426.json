            "content": "I've got few questions:\n\n\n\tWhy is this code now in the accumulator:\n\n\n\n\n+    if (dv.getValueCount() > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {\n+      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"can only handle valueCount < Integer.MAX_VALUE; got \" + dv.getValueCount());\n+    }\n\n\n\nI see that it's still in DefaultSSDVReaderState, i.e. you cannot construct it if DV-count is more than Integer.MAX_VALUE. It also looks odd in the accumulator - it only uses it if the given FacetArrays are null?\n\n\n\tCan you please make sure all the added getters are not called from inside loops, such as state.getIndexReader/separatorRegex?\n\n\n\n\n\tPerhaps you should pull getSize() up to SSDVReaderState as well and use it instead of getDV().valueCount()? Just in case you can compute the size without obtaining the DV (i.e. lazy). Currently you're forced to pull a DV from the reader. If you do that, then please fix the Accumulator to use it too.\n\n\n\nOtherwise this looks good. The gist of this patch is that you made SSDVReaderState abstract (i.e. could have been an interface) and DefaultSSDVReaderState is the current concrete implementation, right? ",
