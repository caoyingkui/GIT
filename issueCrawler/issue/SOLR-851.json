    "description": "I found out that the dependency on https://stax-utils.dev.java.net/ comes down to two places where BaseXMLInputFactory.newInstance() is called.\n\nIs that intentionally or can those be replaced with XMLInputFactory.newInstance()?\n\nThe method newInstance is not defined in BaseXMLInputFactory but in XMLInputFactory which comes from the JDK in Java 6. I don't know about Java 5, though.\n\nIf it's because of Java 5 can I prepare a patch for using reflection to make the dependency on StAX Utils optional? The reason I'm asking is because I'm about to submit Solr 1.3 for IP review to the Eclipse Foundation because I want to use it in our Eclipse project. Lesser dependencies would make it easier.",

All tests pass so I think we should be able to remove this jar from\nour list of dependencies.\n\n[...]\n\nPlease raise an issue in jira for this. "
