Original line:\n\nSolrException.log(SolrCore.log,e);\n\nNew line:\n\nSolrException.logOnce(SolrCore.log,null,e);\n\nThe modified 1.4.1 source successfully compiled and passed all junit tests.  It'll take me a while to get to the point where I can try it out to see whether it actually makes things better.  I'm not qualified to check whether this change will cause problems elsewhere.  This change does not address Hoss's parenthetical comment regarding the logged property defaulting to true. "

Last time I audited the exception logging for that was so long ago that I I think I worked at CNET \n\n(It also makes no sense to me that the \"logged\" property is defaulted to \"true\" in several constructors)\nHmmm, yeah.  Wish I could remember why that was.\nIf we change, we should probably check out all of the places that use those constructors too. "

I have a snapshot from 1/31 (post-2191 and its children) and it still logs a whole stack trace every time the load balancer pings it, if the \"service-enabled\" file is missing.  This is a pretty big annoyance for me because I often use a \"live\", load-balanced dev environment to test new versions with the testing node taken \"out\" using this ping feature.  If nobody else does anything, I'll likely be annoyed enough to fix it eventually. "
