            "content": "Ok. got the first breakthrough after all. I migrated SubQueries test.\nAlan Woodward, you might be interested in noob's feedback. \n\nCopying config folder under the given name to Zookeeper, is not obvious at all:\n\n    String configName = \"solrCloudCollectionConfig\";\n    int nodeCount = 5;\n    configureCluster(nodeCount)\n       .addConfig(configName, configDir)\n       .configure();\n\n \nif it's possible, I ask to simplify it if possible, perhaps more descriptive names or perhaps implicit behavior, or so.\nAlso, I experienced a typical leg-shooting: the test had solrconfig-basic.xml w/o update log. Somewhere deep in log it was reported somehow like ERROR ... RecoveryStrategy  No UpdateLog found  cannot recover. It's not easier to figure out the reason looking at log tail. So, ideally there should be a circuit-breaker preventing cloud launch without updatelogs. \nThese two thoughts is just FYI, not really need to act.        ",

You need to do something like {{{TEST_PATH().resolve(\"configsets\").resolve(name).resolve(\"conf\") - I'll add a method to SolrCloudTestCase to abstract this away.\n\nSo, ideally there should be a circuit-breaker preventing cloud launch without updatelogs\n\nThis would be a nice to have, yes!  There are a few things that are required, both in solrconfig and schema, for cloud to work, and it would be good to have some kind of checking at core-load time - do you want to open a separate JIRA for that?

For example, for the 6.0.1 release, I'm using CHANGES.txt to decide which issues to backport.\n\nIf we're more careful in the future with JIRA fix version setting, it's possible that CHANGES.txt could be auto-generated from JIRA - I know some projects do that, and it's been discussed in the past for Lucene/Solr.
