It does so with a Solr query which is a GET and can fail if there are many mismatches. Switch this to a POST.\n\nIf there are still any errors as a result of this, we should still ignore them rather than failing the test so as to not unmask the original issue (this query is anyway being done to only add more debug information to mismatches).",
