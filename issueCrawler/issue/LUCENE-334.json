    "description": "It appears that the query parser is treating words that start with \"and\" as \nboolean modifiers.\n\nI have a simple search query which does a simple OR against two terms.  If the \nsecond term is a word that begins with \"and\", the query parser reports an \nerorr with the query.\n\nFor example:\n\nbob or andrew\n\nas a search string will result in the error:\n\nEncountered \"AND\" at line 1\n\nThere is a workaround where you wrap each term in quotation marks:\n\n\"bob\" or \"andrew\"\n\nThis appears to comfort the query parser, however it still seems like a bug to \nme.",
