            "content": "So I tried to port the existing script from Linux to Solaris and it's not going to work.  Mostly it comes down to 2 problems: ps and lsof.  On Solaris the default version of ps doesn't understand ps auxww.  The command line options aren't the same.  You can try and work around it by using ps from /usr/ucb, but ultimately trying to parse the out the command line arguments is the problem.  On Solaris command line arguments are limited to 80 chars.  On linux command line is not truncated.  Solaris is 80 chars and that's it.  So a lot of the logic trying to parse things from the command line arguments is just NOT going to work.\n\nAdd to that lsof arguments aren't supported either, and lsof requires root privileges it becomes a loosing battle.  At this point I'm rewriting my own script that does simple things start/stop/restart.  The rest I really don't need. ",
