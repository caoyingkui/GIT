    "description": "Currently Solr counts both server-side errors (5xx) and client-side errors (4xx) under the same statistic \"errors\". Operationally it's beneficial to have those errors separated out so different teams can be alerted depending on if Solr is seeing lots of server errors vs. client errors.",

An installation that looked at \"errors\" will now see that value drop by \"clientErrors\".\n\nPersonally I think this is OK, it's easier to explain than \"we didn't change 'errors' because....\"\n\nHmmm, What do you (or others) think about returning \"errors\" as the sum of client errors and server errors like now, but returning two new bits like this?\n\n    lst.add(\"errors\", numServerErrors.longValue() + numClientErrors.longValue());\n    lst.add(\"clientErrors\", numClientErrors.longValue());\n    lst.add(\"serverErrors\", numServerErrors.longValue());\n\n\n\nThat would leave existing behavior intact but provide the additional info.\n\nI'm not so much recommending that as throwing it out there for discussion.\n\n+1 generally though.
