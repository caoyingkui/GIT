I understand that lowercase is safer for general search quality because some uppercase characters can represent multiple lowercase ones.\n\nHowever, having upper-case tokens is often nice for faceting (consider normalizing to standard acronyms)",

            "content": "My only thoughts are the usual ones: to me the analysis chain is not really the best tool to do the job of cleaning up faceting labels?\n\nThese tasks typically dont require tokenization and work on whole values, and may require stuff like extracting values from one field into another. While its true you can do some of this cleanup (casing/trimming,etc) in the analysis chain by (ab)using the fact that fieldcache uninverts indexed values and using keywordtokenizer and using filters like this, its not very intuitive, and you can't do all of it, whereas using something like solr's updateprocessor chain might be a better place to have this support. There is already overlap, e.g. it can trim field contents as well. ",

I'm think that is more confusing than having a distinct UpperCaseFlter \u2013 and the code duplication is essentially the minimum code required for a functioning Filter\n\nto me the analysis chain is not really the best tool to do the job of cleaning up faceting labels\n\nI understand and often agree that other tools are more appropriate.  But there are lots of cases where the search analysis chain gets you so close to the desired display that duplicating things to a specific facet field seems redundant.\n\nThis is the analyzer I am working with:\n\n\n<analyzer>\n  <charFilter class=\"solr.MappingCharFilterFactory\" mapping=\"normalize-my-field-chars.txt\"/>\n  <tokenizer class=\"solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory\"/>\n  <filter class=\"solr.TrimFilterFactory\"/>\n  <filter class=\"solr.ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory\"/>\n  <filter class=\"xxx.UpperCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n  <filter class=\"solr.SynonymFilterFactory\" synonyms=\"path/to/synonyms.txt\" ignoreCase=\"false\" expand=\"false\"/>\n</analyzer>\n\n\n\n\n ",
