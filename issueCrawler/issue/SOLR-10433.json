Doing so would simplify the code (fewer null-checks, validation on change, etc.), and more importantly make the clients safer/less-trappy to use in a multi-threaded context.  For a slightly more detailed discussion, see SOLR-8975 .  Your attached patch adds two SolrClient setters: setPreferV2API and setUseBinaryV2.  If the argument above appeals to you, please consider moving those setter methods onto the Builder for each SolrClient.  (And if the argument really appeals to you, please consider adding some feedback on the patches I've uploaded on SOLR-8975 and its children.  But that's a bit much to ask :-p )\n\tI haven't looked much at the V2 API code, so this might just be a quirk that I'm unfamiliar with....but it strikes me as a bit odd that the V1 and V2 APIs have different means of specifying the read-write format (RequestWriter and ResponseParser objects for v1 APIs vs setUseBinaryV2 for V2 APIs).  Is there a reason that RW/RP objects/setters cannot be re-used for clients using the V2 APIs?\n\n ",

In V1 API the requestwriters are xml and javabin. In V2 they are json and javabin. However the response parsers are same for V1 and V2 ",
