    "description": "When using nested queries in ComplexPhrases,\u00a0and a part of the query is a SynonymQuery, an exception is thrown from\u00a0\u00a0addComplexPhraseClause:\n\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown query type:\"\n{{ + childQuery.getClass().getName());}}\n\nExamples (dogs and tv are synonyms):\n\n\"(cats OR dogs) cigar\"\n\n\"platform* (video* OR tv)\"~10\n\nThe bug is similar in nature to LUCENE-8305, in that SynonymQuery support was added to ComplexPhraseQueryParser (in LUCENE-7695), but was not expanded to nested queries.\n\nThe fix is similar to the one in\u00a0LUCENE-8305, namely to add the same logic in addComplexPhraseClause\u00a0as in\u00a0rewrite.\n\nSee attached patch.",
