            "content": "Support requests belong on the mailing list.  Jira is for bug reports, and we like to confirm them on the mailing list or IRC channel before people create them, because sometimes the \"bugs\" people see are incorrect usage or incorrect configuration.\n\nSolrCloud does have the ability to rebalance leaders.  It was added in one of the 5.x releases, but I'm not sure which one.  Here's some documentation:\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Collections+API#CollectionsAPI-RebalanceLeaders\n\nNote that the online reference guide that I have linked above currently targets version 6.0 (unreleased), but I believe this particular functionality hasn't changed recently.  If you want to be absolutely certain that you are reading docs for your specific version, there are PDF releases of the reference guide for earlier versions that you can find on the Solr website.\n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html ",
