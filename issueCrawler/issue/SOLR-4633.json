    "description": "It would be nice if there was a Solr DocTransformer that calculated the distance between a point field (marked 'stored') and a specified point at query time, and put this on the response as a psuedo-field.  Since 4.0, you can use a function query in the field list, but the function queries get the data from the FieldCache (i.e. in memory).  But the application might not want to put it in memory just to return it, just to ultimately save the client from calculating it there.  And I've got an idea for a way of simultaneously doing an intersects search and calculating the distance for sorting, including multi-value aware, but without the FieldCache or other memory cache.  If the user wants the distance, it'd be a shame to tell them to use a function query which uses the FieldCache.",
