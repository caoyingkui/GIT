    "description": "When doing offline maintenance on my cluster I would like to disable autoAddReplicas since I don't want replicas being created on nodes during this time.\n\nIt would be useful to have an option to enable/disable autoAddReplicas via an API.\n\nThis API would disable autoAddReplicas:\n\nadmin/collections?action=CLUSTERPROP&name=autoAddReplicas&val=false\n\n\n\nNow when I want to enable it again the API call would look like this:\n\n\nadmin/collections?action=CLUSTERPROP&name=autoAddReplicas\n\n\n\nThis uses the CLUSTERPROP semantics of unsetting a property when the val param is not provided.",
