    "description": "The QueryParser currently uses the deprecated class DateField to create RangeQueries with date values. However, most users probably use DateTools to store date values in their indexes, because this is the recommended way since DateField has been deprecated. In that case RangeQueries with date values produced by the QueryParser won't work with those indexes.\n\nThis patch replaces the use of DateField in QueryParser by DateTools. Because DateTools can produce date values with different resolutions, this patch adds the following methods to QueryParser:\n\n  /**\n\n\tSets the default date resolution used by RangeQueries for fields for which no\n\tspecific date resolutions has been set. Field specific resolutions can be set\n\twith \n{@link #setDateResolution(String, DateTools.Resolution)}\n.\n\t\n\t@param dateResolution the default date resolution to set\n   */\n  public void setDateResolution(DateTools.Resolution dateResolution);\n\n\n\n  /**\n\n\tSets the date resolution used by RangeQueries for a specific field.\n\t\n\t@param field field for which the date resolution is to be set\n\t@param dateResolution date resolution to set\n   */\n  public void setDateResolution(String fieldName, DateTools.Resolution dateResolution);\n\n\n\n(I also added the corresponding getter methods).\n\nNow the user can set a default date resolution used for all fields or, with the second method, field specific date resolutions.\nThe initial default resolution, which is used if the user does not set a different resolution, is DateTools.Resolution.DAY. \n\nPlease let me know if you think we should use a different resolution as default.\n\nI extended TestQueryParser to test this new feature.\n\nAll unit tests pass.",

            "content": "cleanest way to be backwards compatible would be to not have an initial default Resolution, and use DateField if no Resolution can be found for the field specified.  Existing clients would still get DateField for all dates, clients that add a call to setDateResolution(\"foo\", BAR); would get a DateTools formated query with resolution BAR for field foo, but other pre-existing fields would still use DateField, and clients that call setDateResolution(BAR); would allways get a DateTools formatted query, either at resolution BAR or at some other resolution if they also use the two arg setDateResolution ",

            "content": "Actually it is documented in the QueryParser how to use a different format for dates:\n\n   ...\n\n\tfeature also assumes that your index uses the \n{@link DateTools}\n class to store dates.\n\tIf you use a different format and you still want QueryParser\n\tto turn local dates in range queries into valid queries you need to create your own\n\tquery parser that inherits QueryParser and overwrites\n\t{@link #getRangeQuery(String, String, String, boolean)}\n.\n   ...\n\n\n\nAnd the javadoc of DateField says:\n\n   Deprecated. If you build a new index, use DateTools instead. This class is included for use with existing indices and will be removed in a future release.\n\nSo the question is in how many future releases we want to support DateField. If we still want to support it in 2.1 I agree to Hoss that his suggestion would be a nice and clean way to do that and I can easily change the patch accordingly. It avoids having another option in QueryParser. ",
