    "description": "As discussed on e-mail thread \"Sharing SolrCloud collection configs w/overrides\" (http://search-lucene.com/m/MUWXu1DIsqY1&subj=Sharing+SolrCloud+collection+configs+w+overrides), Erick brought up a neat solution using HTTP params at create-time for the Collection API.\n\nEssentially, this request is for a functionality that allows the setting of variables (core.properties) on Collections API CREATE command.\n\nErick's idea:\n\n\"Maybe it's as simple as allowing more params for creation like\ncollection.coreName where each param of the form collection.blah=blort\ngets an entry in the properties file blah=blort?...\"",

That seems like the best way to deal with this use case - the core properties should be persisted already, so very simple to add I think. "

Mark was spot-on that it's just a matter of passing the params through to core creation..\n\nMark Miller is that what you had in mind?\n\nSeveral questions though.\n\n1> Is copying the property.key=value necessary in CollectionsHandler.handleCreateShard?\n\n2> Similarly, should the property.key=value stuff be done in OverseerCollectionProcessor.createShard? What about splitShard? Just going by all the params.set that \"look kinda like create\" it seems possible at least.\n "

If you're brave it'd be great to see if it fixes your problem.\n\nAbout the other commands....\n\nSPLITSHARD - I expect so, it has to create another core so we have to at least copy the properties file over (which I'm not sure we do either).\n\nCREATALIAS - I doubt it. This shouldn't affect the core.properties.\n\nRELOAD - That's interesting, hadn't really thought about that. It seems possible to shoot yourself in the foot here though. I'm also not sure that the reload writes out the core.properties file already or not. "

So I'm going to commit this after I run through the precommit and test process and leave it to someone more ambitious to untangle the whole test bits. "
