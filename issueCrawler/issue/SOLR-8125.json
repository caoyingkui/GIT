            "content": "Joel Bernstein I've had a little time to look through the Streaming and SQL items as well as prototype some stuff out. Here is a list of items that I think need addressing:\n\n\tSQL Tests\n\t\n\t\tadd error condition tests for JDBC driver (SOLR-8179 and SOLR-8184)\n\t\tadd where clause tests\n\t\t\n\t\t\tcurrently where clauses only support equality and field names on the left\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\timprove tests to use try-with-resources around Connection, Statement, ResultSets\n\t\tuse assertEquals/assertTrue/etc instead of plain assert statements\n\t\n\t\n\tStreaming Tests\n\t\n\t\timplement closeable support on TupleStream (SOLR-8190)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tcurrently in tests if there is a failure resources aren't closed properly\n\t\t\tcloseable enables try-with-resources instead of wrapping tests with try/finally blocks.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tuse assertEquals/assertTrue/etc instead of plain assert statements\n\t\n\t\n\tFunctionality\n\t\n\t\texpand JDBC implementation to support DBVisualizer/SquirrelSQL (SOLR-8502)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tneeds to be broken down into multiple JIRAs most likely\n\t\t\trequires populating more metadata in JDBC driver\n\t\t\trequires passing schema/field names back with result set\n\t\t\tprototype is here currently just seeing what is possible: https://github.com/risdenk/lucene-solr/tree/expand-jdbc\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tJDBC Support for Authentication (SOLR-8213)\n\t\n\t\n\tMinor\n\t\n\t\tcleanup Streaming/SQL classes to use explicit types instead of plain maps/lists.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWhat is the best way to go about these? Create JIRAs and submit patches? ",
