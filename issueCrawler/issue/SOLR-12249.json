I broke this JIRA out separately to discuss whether it ever makes sense to group by a tokenized text field.\n\nGrouping by the min value in a field is at least consistent, but on a text field I don't think it makes sense.\n\nI propose that we explicitly dis-allow this in both stand-alone and Cloud mode, especially now that there's the SortableTextField.\n\nComments?",
