    "description": "Following on from LUCENE-8273, and as a prerequisite of LUCENE-8308, it would be useful to have a TokenFilter that takes a number of child filters, and repeats its incoming stream, applying each filter in turn.  So for example, you could keep the original term, output ngrams, and apply stemming, all in the same token stream.",

A caveat is that I don't think this will work with tokenfilters that need to read ahead, like SynonymFilter. ",
