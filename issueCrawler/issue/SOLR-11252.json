    "description": "The old Confluence Ref Guide had a draft version of basic docs on the JSON Request API ,but it never made its way into the published guides. During the conversion of the Ref Guide from Confluence, I made sure the page was exported and converted to .adoc format.\n\nAttaching that converted file here so someone could finish the conversion and check that it's accurate before adding to the Ref Guide - I'm not sure if there have been changes that should be documented, but perhaps there have been since the original page was quite old.",
