Bold is som much more readable, and for the simple reason that it's what Google uses, I think it should stay. We could instead change the default layout of the title from being bold to being blue color, and then you'd see highlights for title too.\n\nAlso in general, if you have HTML markup in your content field you'll get lots of worse issues than this.
