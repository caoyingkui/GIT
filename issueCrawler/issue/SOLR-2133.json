            "content": "Related: we should throw an exception if there is unexpected trailing stuff after parsing a value source.\nFor example, today a query of defType=func&q=10,20 parses the 10 and silently ignores the rest.\n\nThe behavior to parse multiple until the end of the string needs to be optional and configurable so we can only do it during parsing of sub-value sources.  If multiple value sources are parsed, they would presumably be returned as a VectorValueSource. "
