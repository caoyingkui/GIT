    "description": "When attempting to tag more than 2 fields with transformers, the documents' fields are not populated except for the id field. This seems to be specific to Solr 7+ as this was not an issue in Solr 6.4.2. The issue only seems to be present for custom transformers, and the default transformers seem to populate correctly.\n\nSteps for Reproduction in Solr 7.2 or 7.3\n\n\tCreate Java project and import solr-core and solr-solrj library jars.\n\tCreate classes BlankTransformerFactory and BlankTransformer see gist\n\tBuild project and put resulting jar into solr\\contrib\\plugins\n\tCreate sample solr core testcore\n\tAdd configuration to the core's solrconfig.xml (see below)\n\tLoad sample documents into core (see below)\n\t(2 fields) Navigate to http://localhost:8983/solr/testcore/select?q=*:*&indent=true&fl=Author:[blanktrans],Title:[blanktrans],id,layer all documents are returned correctly\n\t(3 fields) Navigate to http://localhost:8983/solr/testcore/select?q=*:*&indent=true&fl=Author:[blanktrans],Title:[blanktrans],id,layer:[blanktrans] only id field is returned\n\n\n\n\nsolrconfig.xml\n...\n<lib dir=\"${solr.install.dir:../../../..}/contrib/plugins/\" regex=\".*\\.jar\" />\n...\n<transformer name=\"blanktrans\" class=\"debug.solr.plugins.transformers.BlankTransformerFactory\" />\n...\n\nsample_data.json\n{\n  \"id\": \"1\",\n  \"Title\": [\"The Big Tree\"],\n  \"layer\": [\"fims\"]\n}\n,\n{\n  \"id\": \"2\",\n  \"Title\": [\"Far Far Away\"],\n  \"layer\": [\"buildings\"]\n}\n,\n{\n  \"id\": \"3\",\n  \"Title\": [\"Way Too Long\"],\n  \"Author\": [\"Slim Jim McGee\"],\n  \"layer\": [\"fims\"]\n}\n,\n{\n  \"id\": \"4\",\n  \"Author\": [\"Rumplestiltskin\"],\n  \"layer\": [\"tasks\"]\n}",

However, if you add the implementation of getExtraRequestFields, at least the pass-through works.\n\n@Override\npublic String[] getExtraRequestFields() { \n  return new String[]\nUnknown macro: {field} ; \n} \nCould you review your test and/or my suggestion against Solr 7.4 and let me know if you still see any issues.
