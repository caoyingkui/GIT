    "description": "The bin/solr script doesn't wait long enough for Solr to stop before it sends the KILL signal to the process.  The start could use a longer wait too.\n\nAlso, the RMI_PORT is calculated by simply prefixing the port number with a \"1\" instead of adding 10000.  If the solr port has five digits, then the rmi port will be invalid, because it will be greater than 65535.",

One command that I found for doing silent pauses won't work on XP, and probably doesn't work on 2003 either.  Both of these versions are end of life ... so do we need to support them? ",

Perhaps the default timeout should be something really long.  Initial bikeshed: maybe 3 minutes, same as Collections API?  I did increase it in my patch, to 60 seconds.\n\nA non-windows system will exit earlier than the timeout if shutdown happens faster, and with my proposed patch, the user has the option of changing the timeout to make the hard kill happen faster if they want.\n\nOpening a separate issue for Windows seems prudent.  It needs some work before we can increase the default timeout. ",

Since (if I'm reading it correctly), the loop exits much more quickly if the process actually stops, there's no real problem there IMO. Especially for those of us who start/stop Solr about a zillion times a day when testing stuff. Plus, the pain of leader election/full sync/whatever can be high enough that waiting a bit more is a small price to pay for real-live production systems.\n\n\n ",
