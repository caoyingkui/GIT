    "description": "The extract Streaming Expression is designed to offload extraction services, such as Apache Tika, to worker nodes. This will allow a separate Solr Cloud collection to perform the heavyweight extractions and then send the results to a Solr Cloud collection for indexing. \n\nBy leveraging the Solr parallel executor framework (http://joelsolr.blogspot.com/2017/01/deploying-solrs-new-parallel-executor.html) and worker nodes we should be able to deploy massively scalable extraction services.",
