I feel this is different from choosing json as default wt; the authz class directly dictates how to parse the remainder of the authz JSON object. One of the benefits of Solr's plugin system is that it is quite explicit, you can read it and understand how it is wired.\n\nAn alternative could perhaps be to let Solr's security plugins use SPI. Then instead of removing we could replace class by, e.g. \"impl\":\"rulebased\"? ",

My point is 99.99% of the time nobody is going to use a different authz plugin. So, it's going to be used only by a power user. We don't have to tell the normal users that it's pluggable, they just don't need to know it. This whole pluggability business is an annoyance to most users.   ",

Most users want to run a command solr auth enable or to click a button in UI. More advanced users will talk to our security REST api set-permission etc. Developers and advanced users may craft their own security.json but I don't think those users are annoyed by the class param, rather the opposite, they expect it.?

Both Hortonworks and Cloudera have authorization plugins (for Ranger and Sentry, respectively) that work with Solr. I don't know the internals of how those work, but do you? Since Solr is integrated in both platforms, there are a lot of potential installations that are going to use those plugins instead of Solr's in order to have a single authz management experience.  ",
