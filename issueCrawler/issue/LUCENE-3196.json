            "content": "Looks fine, using this approach, separate norms impl can hopefully go away quite fast g\n\nFor the PreFlex codec I even have an idea for the codec and backwards compatibility: The old norms file could be exposed as standard DocValues field by PreFlex codec. The r/w StandardCodec would never write separate norms files, instead simply write docvalues using this 1 byte approach (of course configureable to have e.g. read float norms, and other additional BM25 statistics or whatever).\n\nJust ideas, Uwe ",
