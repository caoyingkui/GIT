    "description": "Currently the MLT component doesn't accept filter queries specified on the URL which my application needed (I needed to restrict similar results by a lat/long bounding box). This patch also attempts to solve the issue of allowing the boost functions of the dismax to be used in the MLT component by using the query object created by the QueryComponent to OR with the query created by the MLT as part of the final query. In a blank dismax query with no query/phrase clauses, this works although a separate BF definition/parsing would be ideal.",
