I saw the syntax Jason used and just assumed it was supposed to work.\nLet's just change the example on the wiki to include startup?\n\n      <str name=\"replicateAfter\">commit</str>\n      <str name=\"replicateAfter\">startup</str>\n\nThat will match the example schema and prevent any confusion over \"multiple values\".
