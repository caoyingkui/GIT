            "content": "Thinking more about this, an alternative solution is to change SolrDispatchFilter to look for solr.xml in ZK by default in cloud mode, and fallback to SOLR_HOME for back compat, getting rid of -Dsolr.solrxml.location. Do you see any problems with such a solution? Erick Erickson why was an explicit system-prop chosen in SOLR-4718? I'm probably not considering the full complexity of the logic here..\n\nAside: Currently, if you start Solr in non-cloud mode with solrxml.location specified, e.g. bin/solr start -Dsolr.solrxml.location=zookeeper, Jetty starts up but in a bad state, instead of failing fast, but no error is given in the start script. Trying to access Solr gives 500 error with nullpointer. This would also be fixed with the code-change above, since loading solr.xml from ZK would only be attempted when in ZK mode.  ",

You could have solr.xml locally (for some reason) but still want to read solr.xml from ZK. Now that old-style solr.xml is no longer supported perhaps we can move forward.\n\nYour proposal also has the advantage of moving us a little closer to ZK being \"the one source of truth\". At first glance, the idea seems fine since if it wasn't up there, we'd find it on disk.\n ",
