    "description": "When calling deleteAll() on the IndexWriter, the documents are removed from the index and from the taxonomy. When investigating what is happing after the deleteAll() on the disk, I see that in the index-directory I end up with just two files:\n\nIndex-directory:\n\n\tsegments.gen\n\tsegments_2\n\n\n\nTaxonomy directory:\n\n\tsegments.gen\n\tsegments_h\n\n\n\nBUT also a lot of 'older' files, like \n\n\n\t_1_Lucene41_0.tip\n\t_1_Lucene41_0.tim\n\n\n\netc. \n\nIt seems these files are never deleted. If you index a lot and call deleteAll a lot, it will fill up your disk.",

DTW.deleteAll() makes no sense, even if we try to implement it properly (by e.g. adding back doc=0). Rather, either open a DTW with OpenMode.CREATE, or do something like this:\n\n\nDirectory emptyTaxoDir = new RAMDirectory();\nnew DirTaxoWriter(emptyTaxoDir).close();\noldTaxoIndex.replaceTaxonomy(emptyTaxoDir);\n\n\n\nI know that DirTaxoWriter.deleteAll() would have been simpler to the app, but I prefer that we don't expose it.
