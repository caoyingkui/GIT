In the description you are referring to the exclusions of filters, added in SOLR-3177?\nThe unit tests you added don't seem to be testing exclusions or distributed requests. Also, your patch seems to be generated from 4.9, please create the patch from trunk, or if it only reproduces in 5.x or 4.10.x, from the last revisions of those branches.  ",
