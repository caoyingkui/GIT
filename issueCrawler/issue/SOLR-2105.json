    "description": "Today we reference a custom updateRequestProcessorChain using the update request parameter \"update.processor\".\nSee http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml#UpdateRequestProcessorChain_section\n\nThis is confusing, since what we are really referencing is not an UpdateProcessor, but an updateRequestProcessorChain.\n\nI propose that \"update.processor\" is renamed as \"update.chain\" or similar",
