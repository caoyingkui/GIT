    "description": "DirTaxoWriter.addTaxonomies may lead to a corrupt taxonomy index if addCategory is called in parallel. While reviewing the code, the following changes seemed to be required:\n\n\n\tFix the bug\n\tSimplify addTaxonomies code \u2013 it's very complicated, seems rather inefficient, and seems to take care of more than is needed.\n\tThe intention to support multiple taxonomies is unclear, especially since FacetsPayloadProcessor can handle only one Directory and one OrdinalMap at a time. So I'd like to change the method to addTaxonomy. I anyway don't see the reason to add multiple taxonomies at once, one can call addTaxonomy several times.\n\n\n\nI will post a patch soon.",

While this is not a pure benchmark, it does show that the modified implementation is faster than the older.\n\nI will commit this shortly and port to trunk. ",
