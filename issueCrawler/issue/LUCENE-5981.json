    "description": "Instead it asks you nicely to \"not do that\".\n\nDue to the way this is implemented, if you choose to drop corrupt segments, it should obtain the lock before actually doing any reads too, or it might lose more than you think or do other strange stuff.",

            "content": "Here's one patch: \n\n\n\tmakes CheckIndex take boolean readOnly (disallows modifications if this is true, otherwise obtains write.lock).\n\tmakes CheckIndex Closeable to release any lock.\n\tfixed CheckIndex main() to actually call close() on the Directory always.\n\tand moves main() logic to doMain() so its easier to test without it shutting down the JVM.\n\tadds a simple test.\n\n\n\nIts a little complicated (yeah the stupid readOnly param) because I thought it was overkill to require it to obtain write.lock in the \"typical\" case where you are not going to let it drop segments. But when you are, its important to make sure nothing is changing stuff out from under you. ",
