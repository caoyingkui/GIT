    "description": "In our setup, we have two solr applications running on the same box on different ports. We are sharing the same distribution folder However, both instances log garbage collection to the same file, as shown by these two parts from the solr bash shell script (this is from master):\n\n\nif [ -f \"$SOLR_LOGS_DIR/solr_gc.log\" ]; then\n  if $verbose ; then\n    echo \"Backing up $SOLR_LOGS_DIR/solr_gc.log\"\n  fi\n  mv \"$SOLR_LOGS_DIR/solr_gc.log\" \"$SOLR_LOGS_DIR/solr_gc_log_$(date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M\")\"\nfi\n\n\n\n\n# if verbose gc logging enabled, setup the location of the log file\nif [ \"$GC_LOG_OPTS\" != \"\" ]; then\n  gc_log_flag=\"-Xloggc\"\n  if [ \"$JAVA_VENDOR\" == \"IBM J9\" ]; then\n    gc_log_flag=\"-Xverbosegclog\"\n  fi\n  GC_LOG_OPTS=($GC_LOG_OPTS \"$gc_log_flag:$SOLR_LOGS_DIR/solr_gc.log\")\nelse\n  GC_LOG_OPTS=()\nfi\n\n\n\nI'm proposing appending the $SOLR_PORT value into the log file name (perhaps only if non-default) so we can have both logs in our case. I'm happy to provide a patch assuming this direction is desired.",
