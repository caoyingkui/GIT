Supports an external list of \nstopwords (words that will not be indexed at all), an external list of \nexclusions (word that will not be stemmed, but indexed) and an external \nlist of word-stem pairs that overrule the algorithm (dictionary \nstemming).                                              \nA default set of stopwords is used unless an alternative list is specified, the \nexclusion list is empty by fault.",
