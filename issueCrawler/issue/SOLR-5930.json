            "content": "I filed an issue once upon a time for a distributed PingRequestHandler.  I ended up not needing it, though.  Here's what I do right now, which works really well:\n\nMy distributed index uses what I call a broker core.  It's a core with the same schema and mostly the same config as the other cores, but an empty index.  All of the search handler definitions in solrconfig.xml include the shards parameter.  With this, the client doesn't need to know that the index is distributed \u2013 it just makes a request to what it thinks is a single index.\n\nBecause the ping handler just uses one of the local search handlers, it automatically does the right thing, whether it's a broker core or a core with an index.  The load balancer health check is wired to the broker cores on each host, so it will only send queries when the entire index is working. "

A particular Solr instance may be handling several indexes that have no connection with each other.  One of the cores related to one index may be disabled so that it can be rebuild after config changes, but the rest of the cores on that machine are perfectly functional. "
