    "description": "No big deal. \n\ngrowTermBuffer(int newSize) was using correct, but slightly hard to follow code. \n\nthe method was returning null as a hint that the current termBuffer has enough space to the upstream code or reallocated buffer.\n\nthis patch simplifies logic   making this method to only reallocate buffer, nothing more.  \nIt reduces number of if(null) checks in a few methods and reduces amount of code. \nall tests pass.\n\nThis also adds tests for the new basic attribute impls (copies of the Token tests).",

If you switch it on, TokenStreams and Filters use only the new API forcefully and therefore use the separate Attribute implementations from o.a.l.analysis.tokenattributes. If it is switched off, a old Token instance is used instead, see http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenStream.html#setOnlyUseNewAPI(boolean). The red color bug is fixed in trunk now \n\nThere is one problem with the 6 new single attribute instances: They are code duplicates from Token but have no Test. I also think, I should add a missing test similar to TestToken.java and do the same test with 6 Attribute instances.\n\nI will review the other changes later, I have no time today. ",
