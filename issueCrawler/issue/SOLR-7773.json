    "description": "With the changes for SOLR-7392 there is an unfortunate side affect that the variables can now ONLY be set in the ini file because SOLR_HEAP is predefined there. \n\nThe 'bin/solr' script checks for the variables existence and uses it if set, and since the ini gets run at startup it will also overwrite whatever you set outside that file.\n\nIt looks like the solr startup script will default to 512 if nothing is set, so it should not need to be pre-set in this script. Main use case for this is automated deploys, and setting memory values in an environment variable outside of the ini scripts. Do not want to have to hack that file in the write spot during deployment to configure memory values.",
