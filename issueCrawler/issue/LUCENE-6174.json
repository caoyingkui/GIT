    "description": "Whenever I run \"ant eclipse\" the setting choosing the right JVM is lost and has to be reassigned in the project properties.\n\nIn fact the classpath generator writes a new classpath file (as it should), but this onl ycontains the \"default\" entry:\n\n\n<classpathentry kind=\"con\" path=\"org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER\"/>\n\n\n\nInstead it should preserve something like:\n\n\n<classpathentry kind=\"con\" path=\"org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER/org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.StandardVMType/jdk1.8.0_25\"/>\n\n\n\nWe can either path this by a Ant property via command line or user can do this with \"lucene/build.properties\" or per user. An alternative would be to generate the name \"jdk1.8.0_25\" by guessing from ANT's \"java.home\". If this name does not exist in eclipse it would produce an error and user would need to add the correct JDK.\n\nI currently have the problem that my Eclipse uses Java 7 by default and whenever I rebuild the eclipse project, the change to Java 8 in trunk is gone.\n\nWhen this is fixed, I could easily/automatically have the \"right\" JDK used by eclipse for trunk (Java 8) and branch_5x (Java 7).",
