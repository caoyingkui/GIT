    "description": "This issue is a result of a recent discussion we've had on the mailing list. You can read the thread here.\n\nWe have agreed to do the following refactoring:\n\n\tRename MultiReaderHitCollector to Collector, with the purpose that it will be the base class for all Collector implementations.\n\tDeprecate HitCollector in favor of the new Collector.\n\tIntroduce new methods in IndexSearcher that accept Collector, and deprecate those that accept HitCollector.\n\t\n\t\tCreate a final class HitCollectorWrapper, and use it in the deprecated methods in IndexSearcher, wrapping the given HitCollector.\n\t\tHitCollectorWrapper will be marked deprecated, so we can remove it in 3.0, when we remove HitCollector.\n\t\tIt will remove any instanceof checks that currently exist in IndexSearcher code.\n\t\n\t\n\tCreate a new (abstract) TopDocsCollector, which will:\n\t\n\t\tLeave collect and setNextReader unimplemented.\n\t\tIntroduce protected members PriorityQueue and totalHits.\n\t\tIntroduce a single protected constructor which accepts a PriorityQueue.\n\t\tImplement topDocs() and getTotalHits() using the PQ and totalHits members. These can be used as-are by extending classes, as well as be overridden.\n\t\tIntroduce a new topDocs(start, howMany) method which will be used a convenience method when implementing a search application which allows paging through search results. It will also attempt to improve the memory allocation, by allocating a ScoreDoc[] of the requested size only.\n\t\n\t\n\tChange TopScoreDocCollector to extend TopDocsCollector, use the topDocs() and getTotalHits() implementations as they are from TopDocsCollector. The class will also be made final.\n\tChange TopFieldCollector to extend TopDocsCollector, and make the class final. Also implement topDocs(start, howMany).\n\tChange TopFieldDocCollector (deprecated) to extend TopDocsCollector, instead of TopScoreDocCollector. Implement topDocs(start, howMany)\n\tReview other places where HitCollector is used, such as in Scorer, deprecate those places and use Collector instead.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the following proposal was made w.r.t. decoupling score from collect():\n\n\tChange collect to accecpt only a doc Id (unbased).\n\tIntroduce a setScorer(Scorer) method.\n\tIf during collect the implementation needs the score, it can call scorer.score().\nIf we do this, then we need to review all places in the code where collect(doc, score) is called, and assert whether Scorer can be passed. Also this raises few questions:\n\tWhat if during collect() Scorer is null? (i.e., not set) - is it even possible?\n\tI noticed that many (if not all) of the collect() implementations discard the document if its score is not greater than 0. Doesn't it mean that score is needed in collect() always?\n\n\n\nOpen issues:\n\n\tThe name for Collector\n\tTopDocsCollector was mentioned on the thread as TopResultsCollector, but that was when we thought to call Colletor ResultsColletor. Since we decided (so far) on Collector, I think TopDocsCollector makes sense, because of its TopDocs output.\n\tDecoupling score from collect().\n\n\n\nI will post a patch a bit later, as this is expected to be a very large patch. I will split it into 2: (1) code patch (2) test cases (moving to use Collector instead of HitCollector, as well as testing the new topDocs(start, howMany) method.\nThere might be even a 3rd patch which handles the setScorer thing in Collector (maybe even a different issue?)",

            "content": "After I posted the question on how can a document get a 0 score, I realized that it's possible due to extensions of Similarity for example. Thanks Marvin for clearing that up. I guess though that the Lucene core classes will not assign <= 0 score to a document?\n\nAnyway, whether it's true or not, I think I agree with Mike saying we should remove this screening from the core collectors. If my application extends Lucene in a way that it can assign <= 0 scores to documents, and it has the intention of screening those documents, it should use the new FilterZeroScoresCollector (maybe call it OnlyPositiveScoresCollector?)\n\nI don't think that assigning <= 0 score to a document necessarily means it should be removed from the result set. \n\nHowever, Mike (and others) - isn't there a back-compatibility issue with changing the core collectors to not screen on <=0 score documents? I mean, what if my application relies on that and extended Lucene in a way that it sometimes assigns 0 scores to documents? Now when I'll switch to 2.9, those documents won't be filtered. I will be able to use the new FilterZeroScoresCollector, but that'll require me to change my app's code.\n\nMaybe just do it for the new collectors (TopScoreDocCollector and TopFieldCollector)? I need to change my app's code anyway if I want to use them, so as long as we document this fact in their javadocs, we should be fine? ",

If I need to call searcher.setKeepOnlyPositiveScores, then it means a change to my code. I could then just pass in the PositiveScoresOnlyCollector to the search methods instead, right?\n\nI guess you are referring to the methods which don't take a collector as a parameter and instantiate a new TopScoreDocCollector internally? I tend to think that if someone uses those, it is just because they are simple, and I find it very hard to imagine that that someone relies on the filtering. So perhaps we can get away with just documenting the change in behavior?\n\nI think the vast majority of users are not relying on <= 0 scoring docs to be filtered out.\n\nI tend to agree. This has been around for quite some time. I checked my custom collectors, and they do the same check. I only now realize I just followed the code practice I saw in Lucene's code, never giving it much thought of whether this can actually happen. I believe that if I'd have extended Lucene in a way such that it returns <=0 scores, I'd be aware of that and probably won't use the built-in collectors. I see no reason to filter <= 0 scored docs anyway, and if I wanted that, I'd probably write my own filtering collector ...\n\nI think that if we don't believe people rely on the <= 0 filtering, let's just document it. I'd hate to add a setter method to IndexSearcher, and a unit test, and check where else it should be added (i.e., in extending searcher classes) and introduce a new API which we might need to deprecate some day ...\nPeople who'll need that functionality can move to use the methods that accept a Collector, and pass in the PositiveScoresOnlyCollector. That way we also keep the 'fast and easy' search methods really simple, fast and easy.\n\nIs that acceptable? ",

            "content": "Ok I now understand better where score is used in TopFieldCollector ... It is used in a number of places, two important are:\n\n\tMaintain maxScore for returning in TopFieldDocs.\n\tPassed to FieldComparator.compareBottom which takes a doc and score parameters. There is one comparator RelevanceComparator which makes use of the score passed, however that's part of the method signature.\n\tPassed to FieldComparator.copy - again used by RelevanceComparator only.\n\tPassed to updateBottom, which updates the score of the least element in the queue and then calls adjustTop().\n\n\n\n\n\tNumber 2, 3 and 4 can be resolved by adding a setScorer to FieldComparator (as empty implementation) which TopFieldCollector will call in each collect() call, passing the Scorer that was given to it in its setScorer.\n\tThen, we override that in RelevanceComparator, saving the Scorer and using it whenever the score is needed. Of course we'll need to save the current score, so that we don't call score() too many times for the same document.\n\tThis eliminates the need to define on TopFieldCollector whether scores should be saved. The reason is that the Sort parameter may include a SortField.SCORE field, which will invoke the RelevanceComparator.\n\n\n\nThe question is what to do with maxScore? It is needed for TopDocs / TopFieldDocs. It may also be important to know the maxScore of a query, even if you sort it by something which is not a score.\n\nQuestion is - if the steps above make sense, why should we do them at all? \nNow the score is computed and passed on to every FieldComparator we received in Sort. Cleaning the method signature means additional code overhead in RelevanceComparator. If we want to compute maxScore as well, it means the score will be computed twice, once in collect() and once in RelevanceComparator.\n\nWe can solve the double score() computation by using an internal ScoreCacheScorer which keeps the score of the current document and returns it whenever score() is called, unless it's a new document and then it delegates the call to the wrapped Scorer. TopFieldCollector can instantiate it in setScorer.\n\nBut this looks quite a lot for cleaning a method signature, don't you think? Of course if you can suggest how we somehow remove the maxScore computation, then it might be a good change, since only if SortField.SCORE is used, will the score be computed. ",

            "content": "But what is the plan now for the FieldComparator API? We no longer pass score all around, but expose access to scorer, which only RelevanceComparator (in core) will use?\n\nYes. FieldComparator will have a default empty setScorer() method, which will be overridden by RelevanceComparator. In TopFieldCollector (forget the final name now) setScorer() method we set the Scorer on all FieldComparators. During collect(), only RelevanceComparator, if it exists, will compute the score.\n\nWhat if we add a new method, and deprecate the old one?\n\nThe current methods are:\n\n\tSearchable - search(Weight, Filter, int, Sort)\n\tSearcher - search(Query, Filter, int, Sort)\n\tIndexSearcher - search(Weight, Filter, int, Sort, boolean /* fillFields */)\n\n\n\nDeprecate all three, and add the same but take another boolean as a parameter? I have two comments regarding that:\n\n\tThe current methods need to call the new ones with trackScores = true since that's the current behavior.\n\tWhen we are left with only the new versions, I'm afraid those methods will not look 'simple fast' to a user - I now have to decide whether I want to track scores or not, something I haven't given much thought to before. I kind of like the current signature, but I understand your concern regarding defaults.\n\n\n\nBTW, Searchable is an interface, so we cannot add it there. Searcher is an abstract class and we cannot add the method to it with default implementation (as I believe the other search methods will call the new one with default=true). So it only leaves IndexSearcher as an option. But then what if someone uses MultiSearcher? ParallelMultiSearcher? etc.\n\nIs it possible to deprecate a method, documenting that its runtime behavior will change in 3.0 and then in 3.0 change to not track scores?\n\nIf we're touching TopFieldCollector in such a way, I'd like to propose the following refactoring. It stems from the current complex implementation in collect() which checks in every collect call if we have just one Comparator or Multi, and we're talking about having two versions w/ and w/o score tracking:\n\n\tKeep TopFieldCollector as abstract class with a static create() factory method, and an abstract updateBottom() method. It will still implement topDocs(start, howMany).\n\tHave the factory method create one of 4 instances, all extend TFC, but are private internal classes, which do not concern the user:\n\t\n\t\tOneComparatorNonScoringTopFieldCollector - assumes just one FieldComparator exists as well as scoring should not be tracked.\n\t\tOneComparatorScoringTopFieldCollector - assumes just one FieldComparator exists as well as scoring should be tracked.\n\t\tMultiComparatorNonScoringTopFieldCollector - assumes more than one FieldComparator exists, as well as scoring should not be tracked.\n\t\tMultiComparatorScoringTopFieldCollector - assumes more than one FieldComparator exists, as well as scoring should be tracked.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nThe advantages are:\n\n\tWe simplify the API - the user is only aware of TopFieldCollector, and instead of calling a ctor it calls a static create method, which takes all the arguments as the ctor takes.\n\tWe are free to create whatever instance is the right and most optimized one given the input parameters. The user does not care how the instance is called. Hence the long names - they are internal anyway.\n\tThe code is much cleaner and easy to understand. It also does not need to check if we have just one comparator or more in every call to collect.\n\tWe don't need to add a protected score to a NonScoring collector (read above about code readability) just because a Scoring one extends it and will make use of it.\n\n\n\nSince TopFieldCollector is new, we have the freedom to do it right w/o deprecating anything. I think it's a much cleaner design. It is orthogonal to the discussion we're having regarding the search methods and parameters. They will use the create() factory method instead of creating a collector, passing whatever arguments they have. So let's not confuse the two.\n\nThe patch for this issue is ready. As soon as we agree on how to proceed with TFC, I'll add the changes and submit the patch. ",

We have just two extensions to TopDocsCollector, each tracking maxScore differently. Perhaps later on if more extensions are created, or a demand comes from users, we add a ScoringTopDocsCollector class?\n\nShould we implement a default TopDocsCollector.collect/setScorer/setNextReader?\n\nI actually think that TopDocsCollector gives you exactly what I had in mind. When I started it, there was only collect(doc, score) method, and I wanted to have a base class that will implement getTotalHits and topDocs for you, while you only need to provide an implementation to collect(). Now collect has really become setNextReader, setScorer and collect. Meaning, you know what you want to do, TDC just takes care of creating the TopDocs for you, and you can even override topDocs(start, howMany) if you want to return a different TopDocs instance.\n\nI think now it's clean and simple.\n\nWhat happened to OnlyPositiveScoresFilter? (I don't see it).\n\nWell ... you don't see it because I forgot to implement it .\nFunny thing - all the tests pass without it, meaning all that time, we were filtering <= 0 scored documents, but never really tested it ... I guess if it's because we never really believed it'll happen?\n\nAnyway, I'll add such a class and a suitable test class (make sure it fails w/o using that wrapper first).\n\nCan you update javadocs eg something like \"NOTE: you cannot call this method more than once\" .\n\nThat has always been the case. Previously if you called topDocs() everything has been popped out of the queue for you. I understand what you say though, since we have the topDocs(start, howMany) API, nothing prevents a user from calling topDocs(0, 10) and topDocs(10, 10), only the second call will fail. However, I don't really think that's how people will use it ... and if they do, then perhaps they should just call topDocs() and do whatever they need on these ranges using the TopDocs object?\nI'll add that to the documentation as well.

There are some alternatives I see to resolve it:\n\n\tCreate an abstract ScoringOnlyScorer which extends Scorer and implements all methods to throw UOE (also as final), besides score() which it will define abstract.

Then Collector will use that new class, and we're sure that only score() can be called.\n\n\n\nThe last two comments are completely an overlook by my side. I'm not so sure about your proposal though.

So I guess this code has been duplicated for no good reason? Please validate what I wrote and if you also agree, I can change the entire method (score(Collector, int)) to not compute any score and call c.setScorer(this). That will solve it.\n\nSo are you ok with passing Scorer to Collector, instead of just a class with a single score() method?\n\nI will open an issue w/ a fix version 3.0 and take care of all those TODOs. Should the issue also get rid of the deprecated methods? Or will we have a general issue in 3.0 that removes all deprecated methods? ",

A random unlucky outlier won't increase the time.\n\nTrue, min is not a good way to measure what you'll typically see when\nrunning such searches in your app (the real world has lots of noise),\nbut that's not what we're after here.\n\nI reviewed the code in TopFieldCollector and it's almost identical to before the patch, besides I differences I noted above, which don't seem like to have an effect.

            "content": "If you read somewhere above, you'll see that we've discussed this change. It seems that whatever we do, anyone who upgrades to 2.9 will need to touch his code. If you extend Searcher, you'll need to override that new method, regardless of what we choose to do. That's because if it's abstract, you need to implement it, and it it's concrete (throwing UOE), you'll need to override it since all the Searcher methods call this one at the end.\n\nI'm not sure wrapping a Collector with HitCollector will work, because all of the other classes now expect Collector, and their HitCollector variants call the Collector one with a HitCollectorWrapper (which is also deprecated).\n\nWe agreed that making it abstract is the lesser of all evils, since you'll spot it at compile time, rather than at runtime, when you'll hit a UOE.

I also missed the first entry in CHANGES.txt, which explains it.\nIt is the same like with the Fieldable interface in the past, it is seldom implemented/overwritten and so the \"normal\" user will not be affected. And those who implement Fieldable or extend Searcher must implement it. ",
