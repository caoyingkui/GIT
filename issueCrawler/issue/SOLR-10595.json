    "description": "Once the new Ref Guide is live, we may want to redirect pages from Confluence to the new HTML version. \n\nI'm undecided if this is the best idea, I can see pros and cons to it. On the pro side, I think it helps firmly establish the move away from Confluence and helps users adjust to the new location. But I could see the argument that redirecting is overly invasive or unnecessary and we should just add a big warning to the page instead.\n\nAt any rate, if we do decide to do it, I found some Javascript we could tell Confluence to add to the HEAD of each page to auto-redirect. With some probably simple modifications to it, we could get people to the right page in the HTML site: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/How-to-apply-redirection-on-all-pages-on-a-space/qaq-p/229949",

Benefit is that Google et.al will transfer the \"Page rank\" of the old cwiki pages onto the new HTML ref guide so they do not need time building up cred from scratch. However, if the redirects go to a particular version (6_6) then that is kind of waste anyway, since once we're at e.g. 7.5 the old CWIKI links would still redirect to the 6.6 refguide... Which begs the question whether we should establish a version-less URL for the ref-guide, which do not redirect to a particular version but stays on that URL? It could be e.g. http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/latest/ ??\n\nGuess the front-page of the ref-guide is a special case, which could permanently redirect to http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/ ",

IIRC that idea \u2013 for jdocs \u2013 was proposed in the past and deemed confusing for folks who try to bookmark the docs for the \"current\" release they are using, and then come back later and the same url they bookmarked before now talks about code newer then what they are using)\n\n\nBut frankly: regardless of wether a \"latest\" URL redirects or does a server side rewrite, I think having the cwiki redirects go to version-less URLs is a bad idea.  If you asked me 5 months ago i would have been on board, but the switch to asciidoc has already started facilitating/motivating people to discuss ideas about how to revamp and re-organize the content into new pages (with new URLs) now that it's so much easier to edit, and I'm concerend that having cwiki->/guide/latest redirects will be harmful in the long run as the content on those pages change and/or pages get renamed, moved, etc....\n\nI think in the long term it's better for our users to (301-permenantly) redirect the cwiki URLs to guide/6_6 since that's what those cwiki pages \u2013 at the moment they were last in use \u2013 most directly map to content wise.\n\nIf we're going to worry about people with \"old\" bookmarks/links finding \"old\" versions of pages, we should wory about that and care about it just as much/more with the existing /guide/X_Y URLs moving forward (as new versions get released) as we might care about legacy cwiki.apache.org urls \u2013 and solve that type or probably independently (possible with a javascript+css info box or something like that in the hosted HTML pages?)\n\nFor the same reasons/concerns, I no longer think my original suggestion of a \"two layer\" redirect is a good idea \u2013 depending on how we might implement the cwiki.apache.org/.* -> /guide/old/. URLs (301 vs 302) and likewise how (301 vs 302) we might do the /guide/old/. -> /guide/X_Y (or /guide/old/.* -> /guide/latest) i feel like things could get really complicated/confusing/bad in terms of what URLs google displays in results, how bookmarks get updated, etc...\n\n\n\nI think the next step should be to file an INFRA jira requesting new redirects added on cwiki.apache.org that 301 redirect the old cwiki page names/numbers directly to the lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/ equivilent URLs, and work with infra to provide the redirect rules in whatever format they prefer (list of RewriteRules, DB mapping file, etc...) in the aim of redirecting as many URL variants as reasonably possible.\n\nExample: both of these URLs below should redirect to https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/function-queries.html\n\n\n\thttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Function+Queries\n\thttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=32604260\n\n\n\n\nIf there are no objections in the next day or two, i'll follow up with infra on how to proceed.\n ",

Does it make sense to sequence redirects after search works on the new site?\n\nAdding search to the new ref-guide seems like an orthoginal issue to adding redirects.  But for the sake of argument, let's assume for now they should be considered part and parcel...\n\nTo you, today, as an experienced user of cwiki: adding redirects may make it harder to find the docs on ADDREPLICA because you have preconcieved impressions that going to an existing page on cwiki.apache.org and doing a search in that search box will help you find it \u2013 but the docs you find that way are stale and out of date.  A new user \u2013 even if you deliberately instilled in them the preconcieved knowledge that going to cwiki is the best way to find docs \u2013 may get frustrated when they can't find docs on commands/features added after the ref-guide migration using that same approach (and the likehook of that happening will only increase \u2013 never decrease \u2013 as time goes on and more docs are added/changed).  In the more general case that a new user does NOT already have preconcieved knowledge that going to cwiki is the best way to find docs, they are most likely to try and find dogs using google/web-search \u2013 in which case the (current) lack of redirects means they are in roughly the same boat: they are very likely to first find stale / out of date (and growing more out of date daily) documentation.\n\nadding cwiki->lucene.apache.org redirects seems like it can only improve the situation for most users \u2013 independent of the question of when/how we add new (explicit) search functionality for the current hosted ref-guide.\n\n\n\nI'll prep some mapping files and file an INFRA link soon.
