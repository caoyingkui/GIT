    "description": "The statsComponent implementation only supports \"base\" numeric field types. It would be useful to get the non-numeric values for any kind of comparable field: maximum, minimum. Also, \"count\" and \"missing\" make sense for non-numeric field types.\n\nIt would be very useful to, for example, pull the earliest and latest timestamps in a document dump without having to do a sort.",
