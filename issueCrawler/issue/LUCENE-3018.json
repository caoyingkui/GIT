I have a couple of comments for you:\n\n\n\tI think we should default the compiler to whatever ant-conrtib uses as the default so we can remove the -Dcompilername\n\t-Dbuild64 is an option that only works on x86-64 architectures so I think we can remove that too entirely.\n\twe are going to commit the cpptasks jar file into the ant_lib directory so it comes with the checkout meaning you can remove the line in the overview.html file saying that you need to place the jar there.\n\tthe overview should say cd lucene/contrib/misc/ instead of cd lucene/dev/trunk/lucene/contrib/misc/ same is true for ... will be located in the lucene/dev/trunk/lucene/build/native/\n\n\n\nsimon ",

All tests passed!\n\nFor grins I tried the first step on OpenSolaris too, and it generated a big number of compilation errors, which seems strange.  EG it could not find jni.h on this platform.  (I expect a few compilation errors because we are using Linux-only flags, but not that it could not find jni.h)... any ideas? ",
