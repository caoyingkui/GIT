When shutting down the CoreContainer, if you use an alias, you will see: SEVERE: Too many close [count:-1] on org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore@3e37165f. Please report this exception to solr-user@lucene.apache.org\n\nThis is because the primary core will be closed, and then the aliases as well - even though they are the same core.",
