    "description": "I have reason to look at the tests and I'm seeing a few remnants of old/new style Solr.xml support (with and without <cores>). So far:\n> SolrTestCaseJ4.copySolrHomeToTemp with a flag whether old or new style.\n> solr-no-core.xml in test files. Mostly this is identical to solr.xml, here are the differences:\n\nin solr-no-core.xml but not solr.xml\n    <int name=\"autoReplicaFailoverWaitAfterExpiration\">${autoReplicaFailoverWaitAfterExpiration:10000}</int>\n    <int name=\"autoReplicaFailoverWorkLoopDelay\">${autoReplicaFailoverWorkLoopDelay:10000}</int>\n    <int name=\"autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration\">${autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration:60000}</int>\n\nin solr.xml but not in solr-no-cores.xml:\n    <int name=\"leaderVoteWait\">${leaderVoteWait:10000}</int>\n\nThe question here is whether moving the three properties in solr-no-cores.xml to solr.xml  and using solr.xml in all the tests that currently use solr-no-cores.xml would mess up tests and whether leaderVoteWait being in solr.xml would mess up tests currently using solr-no-cores.xml.\n\nI'll make a quick hack at this to see and we can discuss.",

Perhaps make the vars like autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration into some kind of default and set sys props as necessary?\n\nNOTE: I really haven't dug into this at all (doing so now).
