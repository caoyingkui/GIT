    "description": "spinoff from LUCENE-3290, where yonik mentioned:\n\n\nIs there currently a way to get the number of documents that have a value in the field?\nThen one could compute the average length of a (sparse) field via sumTotalTermFreq(field)/docsWithField(field)\ndocsWithField(field) would be useful in other contexts that want to know how sparse a field is (automatically selecting faceting algorithms, etc).\n\n\n\nI think this is a useful stat to add, in case you have sparse fields for heuristics or scoring.",
