            "content": "First: BALANCESHARDUNIQUE will probably be going away so it's unlikely this will be addressed. \n\nSecond: the small added burden of a particular node being leader is not a problem unless you start having 100s of leaders on the same node. Small discrepancies aren't much concern. the use-case this was built for was having several hundred shards each with a replica on each machine (very special circumstances). So when that the cluster was coming up, all the leaders would be on the same node. Unless you're in that situation it's a waste of time worrying about it.\n\nThird: If you really must get them perfectly balanced, you can use ADDREPLICAPROP to move the offending property arounc. ",
