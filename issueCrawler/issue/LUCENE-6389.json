So if we have bugs in the growth logic, it would not be caught by unit tests unless we have more than 256 unique terms. Maybe we could just use 0 as an initial size? This way we don't need to fill it in the constructor and even the simplest unit test would explore the growth code path?\n\nOtherwise +1! "
