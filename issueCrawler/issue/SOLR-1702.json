    "description": "The only component that is consulted now for prefetching fields is SolrHighlighter. This introduces tight coupling of QueryComponent w/ SolrHighlighter. \n\n\nWe should standardize how this is done by all componnets so that there is no coupling.\n\nOne way would be to register the prefetch fields with ResponseBuilder in the prepare phase and Querycomponent  can make use of that info to do prefetching.",
