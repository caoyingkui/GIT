You can easily\n\taccidentally remove segments from your index so be\n\tcareful!\n */\n\n\n\nMy inclination would be to commit this today (ie for 3.0), since it's such an isolated change, but we have said that 3.0 would only turnaround removal of deprecated APIs, cutover to Java 1.5 features, and bug fixes, so if anyone objects to my committing this for 3.0, please speak up soon!

But as the test pass in your test environment, the assertion in the SegmentMerger seems not important for functionality. So in general my code and your first code would work correct. I do not know how costly the initial building of the BitSet used for the input reader's deleted docs is, but one possibility would be to only build/use the additional bitset, if hasDeletions() on the original index returns true.\n\nThanks for clarifying.
