    "description": "The enum/string handling for actions in Overseer and OCP is a mess. We should fix it.\n\nFrom: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-5466?focusedCommentId=13918059&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13918059\n\nI started to untangle the fact that we have all the strings in OverseerCollectionProcessor, but also have a nice CollectionAction enum. And the commands are intermingled with parameters, it all seems rather confusing. Does it make sense to use the enum rather than the strings? Or somehow associate the two? Probably something for another JIRA though...",

            "content": "\n\tRefactor Overseer, OverseerCollectionProcessor and CollectionHandler to use enums instead of strings\n\tCreated a new enum called OverseerAction which has actions specific to Overseer. I didn't want to expose them in the CollectionAction enum which is public and part of SolrJ.\n\tFound and changed all references in code and tests.\n\tRenamed \"createcollection\" to \"create\", \"removecollection\" to \"delete\" and \"removeshard\" to \"deleteshard\" to match corresponding CollectionAction enums. This has the side effect that the keys for these stats in the \"overseerstatus\" API are also renamed but I think that should be okay. I've documented this compat break in the change log. We continue to handle existing items in the overseer queue to preserve back-compat during rolling upgrades.\n\n "
