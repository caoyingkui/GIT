    "description": "(note: lumping these in a single issue since i did them both at the same time)\n\nMore then one person has asekd me recently about how they can configure strings which:\n   a) sort case insensitively\n   B) ignore leading (and trailing although it's not as big of an issue) whitespace\n   c ) ignore certain characters anywhere in the string (ie: strip punctuation)\n\nThe first can be solved already using the KeywordTokenizer in conjunction with the LowerCaseFilter.  I've written a TrimFilter and PatternReplaceFilter to address the later two.  (Strictly speaking, TrimFilter isn't needed since you cna make a pattern thta matches leading or trailing whitespace, but for people who are only interested in the whitespace issue, i'm sure String.trim() is more efficient the a regex)\n\nAn example of how they can be used...\n\n    <!-- This is an example of using the KeywordTokenizer along\n         With various TokenFilterFactories to produce a sortable field\n         that does not include some properties of the source text\n      -->\n    <fieldtype name=\"alphaOnlySort\" class=\"solr.TextField\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" omitNorms=\"true\">\n      <analyzer>\n        <!-- KeywordTokenizer does no actual tokenizing, so the entire\n             input string is preserved as a single token\n          -->\n        <tokenizer class=\"solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory\"/>\n        <!-- The LowerCase TokenFilter does what you expect, which can be\n             when you want your sorting to be case insensitive\n          -->\n        <filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\" />\n        <!-- The TrimFilter removes any leading or trailing whitespace -->\n        <filter class=\"solr.TrimFilterFactory\" />\n        <!-- The PatternReplaceFilter gives you the flexibility to use\n             Java Regular expression to replace any sequence of characters\n             matching a pattern with an arbitrary replacement string, \n             which may include back refrences to portions of the orriginal\n             string matched by the pattern.\n\n             See the Java Regular Expression documentation for more\n             infomation on pattern and replacement string syntax.\n\n             http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/package-summary.html\n          -->\n        <filter class=\"solr.PatternReplaceFilterFactory\"\n                pattern=\"([^a-z])\" replacement=\"\" replace=\"all\"\n        />\n      </analyzer>\n    </fieldtype>",
