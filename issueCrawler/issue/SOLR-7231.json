Borrowed heavily from SpatialFilterTest.\n\nThis patch sets the \n\nspatialMetadataField\n\n in the firstInit(), on the assumption that users will always want to index the geo point in the same field.  Is this reasonable or should we move that choice to \n\nnextRow\n\n so that users can specify a different field for each doc? ",
