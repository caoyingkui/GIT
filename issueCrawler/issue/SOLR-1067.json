            "content": "to followup on a comment i made in that email thread...\n\n\nThe sanest thing to do would probably be to make parseFunction construct a\nlocal instance of FunctionQParser (with a null SolrQueryRequest) instead\nof using QParser.getParser(...).  that should be fairly close to the way\nit worked in older versions\n\n(hmmm... except FunctionQParser does something similar to get a\nValueSourceParser ... a new constructor for FunctionQParser that\nexplicitly tells it to use ValueSourceParser.standardValueSourceParsers\nmight be in order).\n\nI think it goes without saying that QueryParsing.parseFunction should be\ndeprecated as well ... fortunately it's only used in a few places in the\ncore code ... unfortunately those places also don't currently have access\nto a SolrQueryRequest at the moment:\n  1) SolrPluginUtils.parseFuncs \u2013 should probably be deprecated, callers\nof it should start using the QParser APIs.\n  2) SolrQueryParser.getFieldQuery \u2013 it's only used if the\nSolrQueryParser was constructed with an IndexSchema and not with a QParser\n(in which case it can ask the QParser for a subParser) .. the IndexSchema\nconstructor should probably be deprecated as well (but i haven't dug in to\nsee how far down the rabit hole that change would go) \n\nIf we gave FunctionQParser a constructor that took in an IndexSchema instead of a SolrQueryRequest, then that new constructor could be used by both QueryParsing.parseFunction and SolrQueryParser.getFieldQuery and \u2013 we'd still need to use the ValueSourceParser.standardValueSourceParsers as well, but that would be better then picking the ones declared arbitrarily in the last core.
