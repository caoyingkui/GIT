    "description": "We have an issue on currency sum calculation.\n\nDescription of the problem :\n1) Default currency is configured to : USD\n2) We set a value to 2554.55 KRW (column name is price)\n3) Conversion rule USD / KRM is set to  1116.071429\n4) The result value of this function currency(price, 'KRW') is 2544 (0,4 % of error).\n\nThis issue is : currency function convert all price in the default currency with the precision of the currency (2 digit for USD).\nThe precision of the currency should apply at the end of the calcul, not on the intermediaire result.\n\nCould you please check this issue ?\n\nThanks,\nRegards,\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric",
