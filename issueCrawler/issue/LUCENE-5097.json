    "description": "It might be a good idea to remove tons of useless code from tests:\nMost people use TokenStreams and Analyzers by only passing a String, wrapped by a StringReader. It would make life easier, if Analyzer would have an additional public (and final!!!) method that simply does the wrapping with StringReader by itsself. It might maybe not even needed to throw IOException (not sure)",

This one could go away, instead the Analyzer would store a resuseable reader in TokenStreamComponents/the TS cache. Field.java would be simplier as it would just call this method to get the TS from a String field. ",

By this you can reuse the StringReader (without synchronization cost) and we dont need extra code in Field.java handling the field reuse. ",
