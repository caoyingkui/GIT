    "description": "I tested different UUID sources in Lucene\nhttp://blog.mikemccandless.com/2014/05/choosing-fast-unique-identifier-uuid.html\nand I was surprised to see that Flake IDs were slower than UUID V1.\nThey use the same raw sources of info (timestamp, node id, sequence\ncounter) but Flake ID preserves total order by keeping the timestamp\n\"intact\" in the leading 64 bits.\n\nI think the reason might be because a Flake ID will typically have a\nlongish common prefix for all docs, and I think we might be able to\noptimize this in block-tree by storing that common prefix outside of\nthe FST, or maybe just pre-computing the common prefix on init and\nstoring the \"effective\" start node for the FST.",
