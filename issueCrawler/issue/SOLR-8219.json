            "content": "Hi Sergey, thanks for reporting your discovery. I wonder if in addition to wt=json and wt=xml you could also compare 4.5.3 vs. 5.3 for some of the other query response writers, e.g. the default response writers in SolrCore.java ~lines 2170-2188 and share your findings?\n\nFrom a cursory curious look around (on trunk) I see for example that JSONResponseWriter.java declares and uses a CONTENT_TYPE_JSON_UTF8 constant but PythonResponseWriter.java and RubyResponseWriter.java for example declare CONTENT_TYPE_PYTHON_ASCII and CONTENT_TYPE_RUBY_UTF8 constants respectively but they are never used (based on git grep).
