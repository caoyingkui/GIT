    "description": "The edismax lowercaseOperators=false option seems to have been broken by SOLR-3026. \"foo and bar\" and \"foo or bar\" are treated as \"foo AND bar\" and \"foo OR bar\", respectively, even when lowercaseOperators=false.\n\nFix is rather simple, I think (though I haven't tested this). Current code:\n\n        if (i>0 && i+1<clauses.size()) {\n          if (\"AND\".equalsIgnoreCase(s)) {\n            s=\"AND\";\n          } else if (\"OR\".equalsIgnoreCase(s)) {\n            s=\"OR\";\n          }\n        }\n\nProposed code:\n\n        if (lowercaseOperators) {\n          if (i>0 && i+1<clauses.size()) {\n            if (\"AND\".equalsIgnoreCase(s)) {\n              s=\"AND\";\n            } else if (\"OR\".equalsIgnoreCase(s)) {\n              s=\"OR\";\n            }\n          }\n        }\n\n\nAlso interesting is the treatment of \"Or\" and \"oR\", but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.",
