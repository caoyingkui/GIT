    "description": "Since we added newIndexWriterConfig/newDirectory, etc, a lot of tests are juggling randoms around.\n\nInstead this patch:\n\n\tchanges it so LuceneTestCase[J4] manage the random.\n\tallow you to set -Dtests.seed=23432432432 to reproduce a test, rather than editing the code\n\tremoves random arguments from newIndexWriterConfig, newDirectory.\n\n\n\nI want to do this before looking at doing things like newField so we can vary term vectors, etc.\n\nI also fixed the solr contrib builds so they arent hiding the exceptions i noted in SOLR-2002.",
