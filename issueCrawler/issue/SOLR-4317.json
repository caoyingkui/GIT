When TestHarness is called from SolrTestCase4J the only available constructors ignore coreName, set coreName = null, and initialize the default 'collection1.'",

It applies cleanly for me and all tests pass.  \n\nThe patch I'm attaching has an added test for the sharedLib directory which I had complained about in my last comment.  I don't see the 'sharedLib' tested anywhere else but it seems to work outside of the test-framework.  The test fails proving my frustration.  Should I make this a separate issue in JIRA? "
