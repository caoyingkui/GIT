    "description": "I need to highlight results based on a query that contains a join operation. I want to highlight docs that occur in the \"to\" set which is in my understanding the final result set of the join operation.\n\nI made a simple example by indexing example/exampledocs/*.xml which ships with standard Solr distribution. Having these documents indexed to the example server I run the following query:\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=belkin&defType=lucene&wt=json&indent=true&hl=true&hl.fl=*\nIn the query result the section \"highlighting\" looks like:\n\n\"highlighting\":{\n    \"F8V7067-APL-KIT\":{\n      \"name\":[\"<em>Belkin</em> Mobile Power Cord for iPod w/ Dock\"],\n      \"manu_id_s\":[\"<em>belkin</em>\"],\n      \"manu\":[\"<em>Belkin</em>\"]},\n    \"IW-02\":{\n      \"manu_id_s\":[\"<em>belkin</em>\"],\n      \"manu\":[\"<em>Belkin</em>\"]}}\n\n\nSo highlighting works fine. BUT when running this query: \nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q={!join+from=id+to=id}belkin&defType=lucene&wt=json&indent=true&hl=true&hl.fl=*\nIn the query result the section \"highlighting\" looks like:\n\n\"highlighting\":{\n    \"F8V7067-APL-KIT\":{},\n    \"IW-02\":{}}\n\n\nAs you can see highlighting does not work in combination with join. Is this a bug or am I missing something?",
