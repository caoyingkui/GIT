    "description": "The spellcheck component will always mark the term(s) as incorrectly spelled when onlyMorePopular=true, regardless of the term being actually spelled correctly.\n\nThe onlyMorePopular setting can produce collations while the term(s) are correctly spelled. This is fine behaviour. The problem is that is also marks the term(s) as incorrectly spelled when they're actually in the spellcheck index.\n\nSee also this thread:\nhttp://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/correctlySpelled-and-onlyMorePopular-in-3-1-td2975773.html#a2984201",

FSTLookup does have an option to always check for exact matches, so if something exists in the index (is a valid spelling), it will be returned as the first suggestion, followed by other matches (when an exact match is a prefix of other matches, suggestions can still be returned).

            "content": "Oh, ok - thanks. I personally find the terminology used in Solr/ Lucene a bit confusing \u2013 spellchecking and autosuggest are closely related, but they do come in various flavors:\n\n\tspell checking (correcting a possible typo); usually matches nothing or close to nothing in the index and has a single high-matching corresponding suggestion,\n\tprefix completion (simple scenario of unfinished word/phrase),\n\tother kind of completion (for example phrase match based on the current partially typed-in term and its left context).\n\n\n\nThese are closely related and I wonder if there could be a distinction in the returned result so that the end application can distinguish which one is which (to present them in different ways in the suggestion list perhaps?).
