We should start this for the 3.1 release so we can get a clean 3.0 out smoothly.\n\nIt's probably worthwhile to convert a small set of tests as an exemplar.",

As this test should only be ran for specific methods, how about adding a annotation in addition to @Test (with Retention(\"method\") like @TestLocalized.\n\nWhat to do with BaseTokenStreamTestCase? In 2.9 it had also overridden runBare(), but not anymore (because we only have the new TS API anymore), but this is also a typical example when we want to rerun tests multiple times. One on our plan is that this test now runs all analyzer test for different default versions (iterate over Version enum constants). We need then something like @TestAllVersions or something like that. If we jump to JUnit4, we should use the new features for a more elegant solution of these multiple-run tests.\n\nOne note: It would be good to not reformat the whole tests with an Eclipse cleanup, just change the lines you modified, not reformat everything or organize imports and so on.

In the case of TestQueryParser, which is the only test class I saw that made use of the \"include some tests but not others' in LocalizedTestCase, I hacked in running all the tests with all the locales available (152 in my case). Which pushes the number of tests in that one class up over 4,000 FWIW.\n\nRunning that test case went from around 5 seconds to around 15 seconds on my 2 year old Macbook Pro, from inside IntelliJ.\n\nI don't think it's worth trying to refactor that class into two classes, one that has all the tests run with all the locales and one that has the rest of the tests run only with the default locale (which is how I read the code in LocalizedTestcase) for 10 seconds worth of time savings. One could emulate the old process of excluding some tests by returning immediately from those tests that weren't intended to be run with all locales if the current locale wasn't the default, but I don't see that as worth the effort, although I could be convinced otherwise if people feel strongly.\n\nI'll provide a patch for this if there are no objections later this week, perhaps I'll get a chance to look at BaseTokenStreamTestCase before then.\n\nThis will make LocalizedTestCase obsolete and I'll remove it in the patch.\n ",

I'll get the comments right sometime and not have to retype them after making an attachment....\n\nAnyway, this patch allows us to use Junit4 constructs as well as Junit3 constructs. It includes a sibling class to LuceneTestCase called LuceneTestCaseJ4 that provides the functionality we used to get from LuceneTestCase.\n\nWhen creating Junit4-style tests, preferentially import from org.junit rather than from junit.framework.\n\nJunit-3.8.2.jar may (should?) be removed from the distro, all tests run just fine under Junit-4.7,jar, which is attached to this issue. I wrote a little script that compares the results of running the tests and we run exactly the same number of TestSuites and each runs exactly the same number of tests, so I'm pretty confident about this one. I may be wrong, but I'm not uncertain. Single data-points aren't worth much, but on my Macbook Pro, running under Junit4 took about a minute longer than Junit3 (about 23 1/2 minutes). Which could have been the result of my Time Machine running for all I know....\n\nAll the tests in test...search.function have been converted to use LuceneTestCaseJ4 as an exemplar. I've deprecated LuceneTestCase to prompt people. When you derive from LuceneTestCaseJ4, you must use the @Before, @After and @Test annotations to get the functionality you expect, as must all subclasses. So one gotcha people will surely run across is deriving form J4 and failing to put @Test.... \n\nConverting all the tests was my way of working through the derivation issues. I don't particularly see the value in doing a massive conversion just for the heck of it. Unless someone has a real urge. More along the lines of \"I'm in this test anyway, lets upgrade it and add new ones\".\n\nWhat about new tests? Should we encourage new patches to use Junit4 rather than Junit3? If so, how?\n\nI've noticed the convention of putting underscores in front of some tests to keep them from running. The Junit4 convention is the @Ignore annotation, which will cause the @Ignored tests to be reported (something like 1300 successful, 0 failures, 23 ignored), which is a nice way to keep these from getting lost in the shuffle.\n\nWhen this gets applied, I can put up the patch for LocalizedTestCase and we can give that a whirl....

If I inject one bug into a random test using newRandom() that is not using the ctor with name param, the additional error message about the random seed simply prints \"\" as test name. In the past this worked. Ideally it should print ot the current @Test method name as before.\n\nHow to do this? I would like to have this and remove the getName() stuff from the class. ",

I see no usage in making the InterceptTestCase public, as it is only used inside LuceneTestCaseJ4. If a subclass or localized one needs this watchman, too, you can siply create a second one. I also made the field final.\n\nNow the tests for random failures behave like before. I would like to commit this soon. This change also affects the uncaught exception handler. ",

Which is exactly what you made LuceneTestCaseJ4.getName() do <G>. But at least I found Kent Beck's version of the docs, which is a plus...\n\nSo I guess there's nothing to do as far as getName is concerned.... If there is, let me know....\n\nErick ",

It exactly does what also rules.TestName does  \u2013 I found this class later too and realized that it does the same \u2013 only that lucene has the method in the base class for better migration experience .\n\nYesterday I also wrote an extra test assertion, that verifies, that the ported test class has all methods starting with \"test\" annotated with @Test. Robert and me wants to maybe apply this patch during the migration phase when developers are not yet using Junit4 so long and forget to add @Test. The path is very rough and maybe optimized (if @BeforeClass could be used, but cannot as static).\n\nThe string-ctors are not used in lucene, as the testName in Lucene should be automatically from the current method. The additional ctors in Lucene's tests were only very very very old junit3 relicts (later versions of junit3 also do not need it anymore, they set the test name after instantiating). ",
