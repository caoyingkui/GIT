    "description": "Somewhat related to but separate from SOLR-553,\n\nIt would be nice if the highlighter component \"joined\" the formatter tags across an entire PhraseQuery.\n\ne.g. \n\nLights (Live) : <span>I</span> <span>Love</span> <span>You</span> But <span>I've</span> <span>Chosen</span> <span>Darkness</span> :\n\nshould really be\n\nLights (Live) : <span>I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness</span> :\n\nassuming the query that generated these fragments was \"I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness\"\n\nI assume there's issues with stopwords (the But in the name was not formatted)",

            "content": "With the current API, I just don't see this happening. Tokens are given one at a time to be 'lit and returned - these formatted pieces are used to build up the fragments. Even trying to play tricks, I just don't think this issue is cleanly doable.\n\nWith an alternate approach (one that didn't hand off individual tokens for highlighting) its easy enough, but I don't see the approach changing soon.\n\nIt would almost be less of a hassle, if for some reason you really needed this, to just post process and merge continuous spans with regex or something. You still have the issue of stopwords that are not 'lit, etc but they are a lot easier to overcome than the API limitations of the Highlighter framework. "

I can imagine how the UH could be modified to work this way... \u2013 by having PhraseHelper produce one PostingsEnum per SpanQuery (what a phrase is converted into) instead of wrapping/filtering PE's given to it.  Then, instead of producing one position per underlying-term, it could produce one virtual position of the span.  This would only be applicable to phrase queries without slop; not other position sensitive queries or span queries generally.  It might improve passage relevance too. "
