    "description": "From Samir Abdou on the dev mailing list:\n\nHi, \n\nThere is an inconsistency between the files format page (from Lucene\nwebsite) and the source code. It concerns the positions and offsets of term\nvectors. It seems that documentation (website) is not up to date. According\nto the file format page, offsets and positions are not stored! Is that\ncorrect?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSamir\n\nIndeed, in the file formats term vectors section it doesn't talk about the storing of position and offset info.",
