    "description": "FacetConfig.build() takes an IndexDocument and returns a new instance of IndexDocument. This forces you to write code like this:\n\n\nDocument doc = new Document();\ndoc.add(new StringField(\"id\", \"someID\", Store.NO));\ndoc.add(new FacetField(\"author\", \"john\"));\nIndexDocument facetDoc = facetConfig.build(doc);\nindexWriter.addDocument(facetDoc);\n\n\n\nTechnically, you don't need to declare 'facetDoc', you could just indexWriter.addDocument(facetConfig.build(doc)), but it's weird:\n\n\n\tAfter you call facetConfig.build(), you cannot add any more fields to the document (since you get an IndexDoc), so you must call it last.\n\n\n\n\n\tNothing suggests you should call facetConfig.build() at all - I can already see users trapped by the new API, thinking that adding a FacetField is enough. We should at least document on FacetField that you should call FacetConfig.build().\n\n\n\n\n\tNothing suggests that you shouldn't ignore the returned IndexDoc from FC.build() - we should at least document that.\n\n\n\nI think that if FacetConfig.build() took an IndexDocument but returned a Document, that will at least allow you to call it in whatever stage of the pipeline that you want (after adding all FacetFields though)...\n\nI'll post a patch later.",

            "content": "Patch fixes FacetConfig.build to take and return Document. I had to modify it to take Document as well because if we take IndexDocument, we cannot add the Indexable/StorableFields to Document, as it only takes Field. I don't think it is critical that we make FacetConfig that generic - up until now users had to use FacetFields.addFields and pass Document, so we didn't make anything worse.\n\nI didn't add CHANGES as this whole change wasn't released yet. However I wonder if we should mention somewhere that when users port their code to the new API, they don't forget to add the Document that was returned by FacetConfig.build(), and not the one that they passed in. I added warnings in the javadocs, but still... ",
