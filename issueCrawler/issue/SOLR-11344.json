    "description": "This was broken during the refactoring of the Stream Evaluators. The issue is that bounds checking was added which requires the end index to be less than the size of the array being copied. But since the copy is exclusive of the end index it needs to be the size of the array being copied or the last value in the array won't be copied.\n\nA test case will be added to cover this scenario.",
