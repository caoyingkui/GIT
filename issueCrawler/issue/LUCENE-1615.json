            "content": "We know this problem, your fix seems ok (LUCENE-1561).\nWe did not want to change the Fieldable interface again, so we left omitTf in the interface but deprecated the methods in AbstractField & Co. In future, the Fieldable interface should be completely removed for 3.0 and this is a first step towards it! All references to Fieldable should be replaced by AbstractField or a better alternative that also has the type in it (see LUCENE-1597) ",
