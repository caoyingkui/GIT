Cleaning up these fairly ugly code warts (I've particularly been annoyed by this DirectUpdateHandler2) will also help and encourage newer contributors.\n\nWe need to encourage and facilitate cleaning up the crap that we have always said can't be cleaned up. If we have to compromise on some of it, fine, make it only in 5x like we did with 4x. But let's not settle for crap because of back compat. Back compat will sink our ship.

Beyond that, we have always been fairly loose really. I've broken an insane amount of back compat stuff myself - to get major new features to work or fix broken design. A lot of that in 3x or 4x, not over a major version. Now we have all those advances, and the screams of pain along the way where not heard.\n\nI think, until we are in a better spot code wise, we should favor improvement over back compat beyond the http layer. Even in 4x. But good god, for 5x, let the flood gates open. It's way too easy to error on stifling the project. We need to error way the other way IMO. Until a lot of the baggage is dealt with and SolrCloud is first class and in shape, we need to error way the other way.

I someone new to Solr sees this they would ask \u201cWhy is it called like this? Why is this \u20182\u2019?

            "content": "That was okay. But so is my coming to try and make the issue happen anyway.\n\nWhen someone with enough merit comes in and only mentions, I'm pretty much against this, it has a strong chilling effect!\n\nIf you had come in with, \"I have these concerns, but if we do this or this and/or figure out this, we could probably make this happen\", I wouldn't have felt so much that I have to try and make sure this issue still happens.\n\nI've just seen too many of these issues die summarily with light and easy pushback. For some crap JIRAs, perhaps that is sensible. Given the history of Tomas and his recent contributions and the quality of work I have seen and my own personal history and interest in this change...here we are!\n\nHowever, I'm not saying you shouldn't have done whatever you want to do. I'm responding to it. I'm trying to start a tone going forward that will let us dump single core and non cloud mode and all the baggage that makes the system not as beautiful as it needs to be. Developers want to work on beautiful, not ugly. That's our largest issue. Not any internal community communication.\n\nNow when I look at the pace of this happening, we will be done in 5-10 years. Perhaps. It's not going to cut it. We will be marginalized. "

We should clearly document that this is an expert and internal class. We need to own this, and right now it's in a grey area. What better time to clear up that it's internal and not user supported and rename it all in one. Take it out of config, document at as expert/internal.\n\nUnless someone has a burning desire to call it NewUpdateHandler3 in a couple years, I think a new name will stick for some time. Anytime you name a class Foo2, I think you can expect someone is going to want to \"fix\" it later. Call it Foo or Bar and you will get less name change demand. "
