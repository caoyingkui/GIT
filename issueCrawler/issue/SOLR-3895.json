            "content": "Hi Martin,\nthanks for your report after our communication about this before. I agree, it would be a good idea to not allow external entities (those can be e.g., references to external DTDs - but we never check XML validity according to a DTD) and also other external entities like &foobar; introduced by those DTDs should not be loaded:\n\n\n\tLot's of XML files come with a DTD declaration (like XHTML document or similar things). If you would pass those XML documents through the update handler (with e.g. XSL transforming to Solr XML), those DTDs would be resolved and loaded by the xml parser - with no use for Solr.\n\tAll documents passed to XMLRequestHandler should be self-complete, means no includes or similar things. xinclude is not enabled for XML-updates, so external entities should also be ignored.\n\n "

            "content": "Patch. This approach adds a generic EntityResolver for SAX and StaX parsers that can be used also outside XMLUpdateReqHandler, e.g. in DIH. It resolves all external entities to an empty InputStream. By this XMLUpdater ignores external entities like DTDs or entity declarations (&foobar;) and ignores them.\n\nThe downside by this is, that XML documents that actually make use of these features to include some external stuff would silently ignore those &foobar; entities.

But this lead me to discover that SYSTEM entities in the xsl docs (aparently) aren't being ignored, so with the patch attached (trying to refer to a bogs file fro mthe XSL) you get a stylesheet compilation error \u2013 so i think maybe there is still a code path missing the use of your new EmptyEntityResolver?  (either that or i've just got a silly bug in the stylesheet that isn't obvious to me) "

All those files use external entities (and SolrResourceLoader has an own EntityResolver to support xinclude and external entities -> it resolves external entities and xincludes using ResourceLoader, too) -> different story. This patch is about disabling entities for loaded documents, not for config files like solrconfig.xml, schema.xml or the transformation. "
