    "description": "In 1.4.x branch, the download link to NNI.jar (LGPL) points to Carrot2.org which sometimes used to cause build errors and is generally not\nas reliable as Maven Central. It would make sense to replace this link if further releases from that branch are ever to be made (just in case).\n\nThe Solr branch applicable to this patch is here (right?)\nhttps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/solr/branches/branch-1.4",
