    "description": "Redhat wants to backport some security fixes we applied in 4.1 and 4.6 to the Solr tree to 3.6, because their user-base still uses this version. To help them with backporting across the major API/version changes, we should also do this on the 3.6 branch.\n\nRedhat already assigned 3 CVE numbers to these issues and take the older issues seriously, and they will patch older versions and also force users to upgrade. cf, CVE-2013-6397 (SOLR-4882), CVE-2013-6407 (SOLR-3895), CVE-2013-6408 (SOLR-4881).\n\nTo fully fix, we might need to backport more patches. I will take care of this. This issue may be useful, if we release a 3.6.3 package.",

I'm not familiar with the Solr codebase but I believe the addition made on L125 is overwritten at L128 also visible in the diff.\nFor background we (Sonatype) track vulnerabilities affecting artifacts in Maven Central.\n\nMatthew Piggott "
