    "description": "Right now sometimes it's lat, lon and other times it's lon, lat which\nis just asking for horrors of biblical proportions.\n\nI went through and carefully fixed them to take lat, lon in all places\nI could find, and renamed y -> lat and x -> lon.  I also removed\nunused code, or code only called from tests: I think Lucene shouldn't\njust export spatial APIs unless we also ourselves need them for\nindexing and searching.  Finally, I tried to shrink wrap the APIs,\nmaking previously public apis private if nobody external invoked them.",
