    "description": "In SOLR-12607, I found a bug where the StdNode's shard was not set correctly causing exceptions during updates forwarded to sub-shard leaders to not be sent back to the clients. This can cause data loss during split. A fix was committed as part of SOLR-12607 but we need to expand coverage to this situation. I'll add failure injection during the synchronous update step to simulate this condition. This will be randomized for each shard split test method.",
