    "description": "The old Ref Guide in Confluence had a DRAFT page called \"Advanced Distributed Request Options\" which discussed the shards, collection, and _route_ parameters in more detail than they are otherwise covered in the Guide.\n\nSince it was a draft page and not published, it was not converted as part of the move to the new Ref Guide, but as with other DRAFT pages I kept it and did a preliminary conversion to asciidoc format in case we wanted it later. \n\nThis issue is to evaluate if we want to incorporate this content into the Ref Guide, where it should go (it doesn't have to be a separate page), and finalize the conversion to include it. The attached advanced-distributed-request-options.adoc file includes the preliminary conversion.",
