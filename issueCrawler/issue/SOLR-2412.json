    "description": "Hierarchical faceting with slow startup, low memory overhead and fast response. Distinguishing features as compared to SOLR-64 and SOLR-792 are\n\n\n\tMultiple paths per document\n\tQuery-time analysis of the facet-field; no special requirements for indexing besides retaining separator characters in the terms used for faceting\n\tOptional custom sorting of tag values\n\tRecursive counting of references to tags at all levels of the output\n\n\n\nThis is a shell around LUCENE-2369, making it work with the Solr API. The underlying principle is to reference terms by their ordinals and create an index wide documents to tags map, augmented with a compressed representation of hierarchical levels.",

From normal faceting, I think it would be done via facet.prefix=L0_T1/L1_T1\nI tried facet.prefix and efacet.prefix. \nAdditionally, am I correct that the number of documents matching a facet field are to be in the \"count\" field/key (in standard faceting, it is with the facet field name)? The count seems not to match, but I am still testing.\nThanks in advance. "

If a document has \"foo/bar\" and \"foo/baz\", and the search only hits that document, the count for level 0 will be 2.
