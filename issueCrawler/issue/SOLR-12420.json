    "description": "I propose that the schema version be removed in lieu of using luceneMatchVersion for this.  One less thing to manage (in code, need REST API \u2013 SOLR-7242, thing to document; etc.).  We don't need the fidelity to differentiate from luceneMatchVersion.  We're already using luceneMatchVersion for things instead of having a ton of additional version numbers.  I can understand the point of putting a version number in in a config file but I don't think we should continue this practice.\n\nTo make this happen, if the luceneMatchVersion is >= 7.4 (the release which we start doing this) then a non-existent schema version becomes equivalent to the latest schema version.  Specifying the schema version becomes deprecated but supported; we might log a warning. \n\nIn 8.0, strip schema version out altogether.",
