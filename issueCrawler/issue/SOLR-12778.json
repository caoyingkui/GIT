    "description": "The VMParamsSingleSetCredentialsDigestZkCredentialsProvider takes a zkDigestPassword in as a plain-text JVM param, and the VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider takes both zkDigestPassword and\u00a0zkDigestReadonlyPassword.\n\nPropose to give an option to encrypt these password using the same mechanism as DIH does:\n\n\tAdd a new VM param \"zkDigestPasswordEncryptionKeyFile\" which is a path to a file holding the encryption key\n\tStore an encryption key in above mentioned file and restrict access to this file so only Solr user can read it.\n\tEncrypt the ZK passwords using the encryption key and provide the encrypted password in place of the plaintext one\n\n\n\nWe could also create a\u00a0utility command that takes the magic out of encrypting the pw:\n\nbin/solr util encrypt [-keyfile <file>] <string>",
