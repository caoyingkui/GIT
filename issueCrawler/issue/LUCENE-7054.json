            "content": "initial patch.\n\nI hooked in the new query into the existing test infra (TestLatLonPointQueries/BaseGeoPointTestCase) but also added a conceptually simpler random test to TestLatLonPoint that doesn't have any leniency/tolerance/deltas. \n\nI tried to keep it simple and free of things like floating point error, to keep testing exact.\n\nWe don't do any fancy geometric stuff like computing whether circles intersect with rectangles (there are utility methods here, but i did not have such luck with this approach). \n\ntests seem to pass under beasting... no benchmarking whatsoever though.
