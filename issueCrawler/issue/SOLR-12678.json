This question should have been brought up on the mailing list or IRC channel.\n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc\n\nFrom what you wrote, I cannot figure out what it is that you want to do, so when you take your question to the community, please describe it as completely as you can.\n\nEven when reporting problems, we prefer to discuss them in the community before opening an issue in Jira.\n\nIf it turns out that you have a problem to report after discussion, we can always re-open this issue, or you can open a new one.
