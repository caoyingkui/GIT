    "description": "When running the getting started example of solr 5.5 and 6.6 I noticed a peculiar behavior that occurs for single character queries under the /spell requestHandler\n\nWhen searcher for a single term the response from solr does not have a spell check section compared to a two character query which does.\n\nThis seems to be independent from things like minPrefix (1 by default) and minQueryLength (4 by default).\n\nI would expect that any number of character would return a spellcheck section.\n\nI first came across this when trying to upgrade a solr plugin that had tests using single queries to assert suggestion counts.\n\nI have included screenshots of the response.",
