    "description": "The Kerberos Authentication Plugin ref-guide page does a good job of informing users how to setup Kerberos in their Solr deployments.\n\nBut it's also got some papercuts that make it tougher to follow than it needs to be.  These include:\n\n\tsome code snippets use classes that no longer exist.  This confuses new users, as shown by this mailing list question that came up the other day: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/SolrJ-Kerberos-Client-API-td4396275.html\n\tno mention of bin/solr auth for modifying security.json for Kerberos.\n\tmissing explanation of solr.kerberos.name.rules syntax/meaning\n\tthe name: the article's doesn't just cover Solr's auth plugin.  It walks a user through setting up Kerberos on their cluster.  Maybe a more general name is appropriate. (\"Setting Up Kerberos\"?  \"Kerberos Support\"?)\n\n\n\nNone of these are major, but I've run into enough papercuts trying to use the page that I think it's worth fixing.  If anyone has other suggestions for changes please let me know.  I hope to have a draft up shortly for review.",
