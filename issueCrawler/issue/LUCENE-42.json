Based on the below text, which\ncomes directly from the Jakarta project site, this is supposed to be the\nmechanism to request feature enhancements.  I recieved one e-mail saying that\none of my bugs was closed, because you use a TODO list in CVS for enhancements.\n I know that Lucene hasn't been a Jakarta project for very long, but since it\nis, it should follow established Jakarta project methods for such a thing.  I\nfind it much easier to request a feature enhancement through the standard\nJakarta mechanism, because I can use to track my requests against the project. \nIf you want to add my request to the TODO list in CVS from here that is fine,\nbut I would like to track this through this request.\n\nPier Fumagalli has set up the Apache Bug Database. Please use this database\nreport bugs and suggest new features. To suggest a new feature, set the severity\nof the bug to \"enhancement\".\n\nThanks. ",

This is my first patch, so I am not sure that is ok,\nrather, I might have to post the entire library, and change the build \nto\nlink with it???\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nRobert Engels ",
