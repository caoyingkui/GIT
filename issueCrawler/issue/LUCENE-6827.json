            "content": "Indeed, we should review all usages of LinkedList throughout Lucene/Solr. It is not clear why it was used here, but some places used it in pre Java 6 times to allow fast removal and addition of entries at beginning (typical LIFO/FIFO usage).\n\nSince Java 6 the much better data structure for this is java.util.Deque (which LinkedList implements), but using ArrayDeque as implementation is much more heap/performance efficient.
