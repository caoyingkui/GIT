    "description": "Ever since LUCENE-5644, IndexWriter will aggressively reuse its internal thread states across threads, whenever one is free.\n\nI think this means we can safely remove the sneaky maxThreadStates limit (default 8) that we have today: IW will only ever allocate as many thread states as there are actual concurrent threads running through it.",

Looking at the source, it used to construct a new DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool instance and setting it.\n\nUnfortunately, setIndexerThreadPool has package visibility, and besides, that constructor has been removed from DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool.\n\nWere we mistaken in our understanding of the purpose of this method? Going forward, how can we be limit the number of threads that can write to an index? "
