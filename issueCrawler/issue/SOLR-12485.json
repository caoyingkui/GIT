I think it doesn't matter here since the XML format is very explicit about this, whereas the JSON syntax had more ambiguity in its structural interpretation.  Any way, if we make anonChildDocs go away, fixed at \"false\" in master (8.0), it'll be a non-issue.  We should have an issue for that.  It's not quite that trivial since if you provide the key name _childDocuments_ then it's definitely an anonymous child doc (thus should ignore anonChildDocs).  One new issue can handle that.  I'll create it. ",
