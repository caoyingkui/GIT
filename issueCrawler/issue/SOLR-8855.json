It looks like we'd be dropping data that is still in the cache but hasn't been written yet.\n\nNot sure I understand that - this stops dropping from the cache, it does not add it.\n\nWhy does the core container need to be volatile?\n\nBecause it is set in init - and we don't really know when an external user may call that or in what thread. Technically, if that is to be thread safe, it should be set in the constructor and be finally or be volatile. Given volatile reads without updates are basically as fast as regular reads, just better to be airtight IMO. ",
