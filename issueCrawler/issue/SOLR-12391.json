But in the code that word is supposed to be \"Suggestions\", so it stops half-way through. I cannot tell why, though - the HTML looks valid (and the whole page passes a HTML validator):\n\n\n<li ng-show=\"isCloudEnabled\" id=\"cluster-suggestions\" class=\"global\" ng-class=\"{active:page=='cluster-suggestions'}\"><p><a href=\"#/~cluster-suggestions\">Suggestions</a></p></li>\n\n\n\nThe last time this page (solr/webapp/web/index.html) was changed was by Shalin for SOLR-11648. But that change is in 7.3 and this problem does not exist there. It's got to be something else. ",
