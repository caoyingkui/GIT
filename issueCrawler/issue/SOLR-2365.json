We should put the <lib> directive into Solr's main example solrconfig.xml (just we do with clustering, Solr Cell, etc) also.\n\nOther than that, no objections to this.  \n\n[tangent, but ideally we can eventually get all Solr UI to be Velocity generated, and plugins can then ship with their own .vm files in the JAR file to add in something like a dataimport.jsp] "
