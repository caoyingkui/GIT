The page shows an alert with the message (test.test was my core name):\n\n404 Not Found get #/test.test\n\nTo replicate: start solr in multicore mode, go to \"localhost:8983/solr\", via core admin create a new core \"test.test\", then refresh the page. \"test.test\" will show under the menu at the bottom left. Clicking on it causes the message, while no core menu appears.",

I have tried the patch, but patching my existing 4.0 installation (as downloaded from the website) was a little troublesome, as those files that the patch indicated as being in:\n\nsolr/webapp/web/js/scripts\n\nare actually under:\n\nsolr-webapp/webapp/js/scripts\n\nin my installation. Replacing the paths in the patch and applying it, however, worked, and the web gui seems to work w/o issues. (I had however to open the web gui in another browser, as mine seemed to have cached all those js and refused to reload them unless I refreshed them one by one). "
