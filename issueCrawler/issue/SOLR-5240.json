And I guess the \"wait for more replicas\" is part of the core \"loading\"... hence a temporary deadlock until things time out. "

Note that this deadlock-until-timeout situation can also easily happen even when replicas of a particular shard aren't on the same node.  All that is required is to have more than 3 cores per node. "
