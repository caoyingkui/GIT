    "description": "When creating a new collection through the Collection API, the Overseer (handling the creation) will spread shards for this new collection across all live nodes.\n\nSometimes you dont want a collection spread across all available nodes. Allow for the create operation of the Collection API, to take a createNodeSet parameter containing a list of Solr to spread the new shards across. If not provided it will just spread across all available nodes (default).\n\nFor an example of a concrete case of usage see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4114?focusedCommentId=13505506&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13505506",

The following should work if you have a checkout of revision 1412602 of branch lucene_solr_4_0\n\t\n\t\tcd <checkout-folder>\n\t\tpatch -s -p0 < SOLR-4114.patch\n\t\tpatch --ignore-whitespace -p0 < SOLR-4120.patch\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nYou need the --ignore-whitespace - at least with my version of patch on Show Leopard. Probably because I do not have the correct Solr code-style installed in my Eclipse. Hmmm, probably should do that.\n\nContent of the patch\n\nThe patch modifies the create operation of the Solr Collection API, so that it allows to provide a list of Solrs that the shards for the new collection should be spread across\n\n\tParam key: createNodeSet (OverseerCollectionProcessor.CREATE_NODE_SET)\n\tParam value: comma-separated list of node-names (equal to the node-names received from ClusterState.getLiveNodes())\n\tParam is not mandatory. If not provided the created collection will still have its shards spread across all live nodes\n\n\n\nTesting \n\nBasicDistributedZkTest.testCollectionAPI has been modified to also test this feature "
