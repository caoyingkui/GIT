    "description": "In SOLR-11709 I proposed adding an \"expanded\" JSON Object syntax for specifying aggregation stats, as a way to ultimately support applying domain changes to aggregations.\n\nHaving since done more work with the implementation of aggregations and how they use SlotAcc(umulators) and how bucket sorting on aggregations work, I now realize that the goal of SOLR-11709 is pretty hard \u2013 but the idea of this \"expanded syntax\" would still be useful as a way to specify Local Params to the ValueSourceParser used for the aggregation \u2013 and would but stats on par with other \"type\" facets (syntactically).\n\nFor things like relatedness(...) (or other user defined custom aggregations) it would allow for new optional configuration using \"named\" params w/o needing an unweildy function syntax (see comment#16466664 in SOLR-9480).  But even for simple aggregations the expanded syntax may help folks with readability of expressions(w/o needing to resort to global params) ...\n\nProposed syntax...\n\n\n  \"average_roi\" : {\n    \"type\": \"func\",\n    \"func\": \"avg(div($numer,$denom))\",\n    \"numer\": \"mul(popularity,rating)\",\n    \"denom\": \"mul(price,size)\"\n  }",
