            "content": "The Dynamic field *_coordinates should be stored=false. You have it set to true. If you change it back to false and reindex, the problem should go away.\n\nThe question is why is it true for your setup. The Solr examples have it as false, including useDocValuesAsStored=\"false\" as well.\n\nThe root cause is that the content of the field is created from the other source, on update, when the document is reconstructed, the coordinates field gets its own stored value and then a second copy of it when the parent location type splits into the coordinates fields internally.
