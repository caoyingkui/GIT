    "description": "I'm trying to change the settings for a specific collection, which is empty, with a new config.\n\nThe collection has 2 shards, and the zookeeper is a cluster of 3 servers.\n\nI used the zookeeper to upload the configuration and link it with the collection. After this, I reloaded the collection in both nodes (replica and leader) but when I try to see the STATUS of collection's core (/solr/admin/cores?action=STATUS&wt=json&indent=true) I get this error:\n\n\"ST-4A46DF1563_0812\":\"org.apache.solr.common.cloud.ZooKeeperException:org.apache.solr.common.cloud.ZooKeeperException: Specified config does not exist in ZooKeeper:statisticsBucket-aggregation-revision-1\"\n\nThe clusterstate.json shows that the ST-4A46DF1563_0812 has loaded the configname: \n{\"configName\":\"statisticsBucket-aggregation-revision-1\"}\n\nIf the zookeeper has the new config loaded and I linked the config to the collection, why the status of core says that the configuration is missing?\n\n/Yago",
