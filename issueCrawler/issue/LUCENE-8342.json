    "description": "This is a spin-off from LUCENE-8335 where we discuss adding a boolean to FieldInfo to check if the field is used for soft deletes. This has been a a very delicate line we drew in the past but if we take a step back and think about how we'd design a feature like IW#updateDocument(Term, Document) today would we allow passing different fields to this API? It's just one example ie. storing floats and ints in the same DV field is a different one. I personally think it would be a good idea to be more strict on that end and I wonder what others think.",
