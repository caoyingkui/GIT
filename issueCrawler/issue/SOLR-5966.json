It's also a problem on 4.6.1 and 4.2.1, the other versions that I have available for quick trial.  I never noticed this because I've always got a high resolution display and my browser takes up most of the screen area.  This is a problem for people who are using ultra-light laptops that rarely have much in the way of vertical resolution.\n\nOne workaround is the zoom feature in the browser, which can usually be accessed by holding down the ctrl key and turning the zoom wheel on the mouse.  Ctrl-0 (zero) will reset to normal on both IE and Firefox. "

Or you can access the browser's menu and change the zoom level there.\n\nI'm aware that as workarounds go, this is not a very good one, but it should work. "
