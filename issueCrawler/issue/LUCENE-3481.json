    "description": "Building a new index using FSDirectory.open(new File(path) on a FAT32 drive from OSX. Once the index has built but the index writer has not been closed because I want to optimize it I create a new indexwriter to create a second completely different index. However this fails with \n\nException in thread \"main\" java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException\n    at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl$SharedFileLockTable.checkList(FileChannelImpl.java:1166)\n    at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl$SharedFileLockTable.add(FileChannelImpl.java:1068)\n    at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.tryLock(FileChannelImpl.java:868)\n    at java.nio.channels.FileChannel.tryLock(FileChannel.java:962)\n    at org.apache.lucene.store.NativeFSLock.obtain(NativeFSLockFactory.java:216)\n    at org.apache.lucene.store.Lock.obtain(Lock.java:72)\n    at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:1097)  \n\nbut this should not occur as I am not locking the same file, this second index is being built in a different directory albeit with the same parent directory as the other index.\n\nI think the issue is specifically to do with OSX - FAT32 interaction because the problem always occurs, but never occurs if I build the indexes on the internal Mac drive. \n\nThe only way I could resolve this was to remove locking using \n\nFSDirectory.open(new File(path), NoLockFactory.getNoLockFactory() );",
