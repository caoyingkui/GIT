This docs.tar.gz file should contain Lucene and Solr Javadocs.\n\nThis would solve the following problems:\n\n\tPeople can still download Javadocs, if they like to browse them offline, but it won't blow the release\n\tThe release manager has an easier job to push them to the website. The current process broke by SOLR-9450.",

The idea is to have both in one file for Solr users. Lucene already has its own docs in its own tar.gz file (there is no change). This is why I opened it in Solr's project. It is for publishing the \"full Solr documentation\" (which must include Lucene for navigation purposes). ",

This can be documented.\nOr if we need it packaged, instead of a new tgz release artifact, could we instead build javadoc jar files and upload to maven-central e.g. solr-solrj-6.5.0-javadoc.jar? Some IDEs can pull javadoc automatically, or developers could also download and unzip. ",

            "content": "Hi the issue here is:\nThe RM of Lucene and Solr hast to upload the Javadocs/Documentation to the web page. Currently he has to build the release and then copy away the javadocs files from the build folders. When the vote has succeeded he would commit the javadocs to web page.\n\nPreviously this was done by using the already voted on tar.gz binary releases, where the docs folder was extracted and uploaded to Website SVN. Now, the javadocs have to be preserved manually and we cannot vote on them (layout, design issues). So the idea was to just pack them during the release process so we can vote on them and its easier for the RM to publish them on the web site.\n\nWe already publish javadocs maven artifacts, but only per module: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.solr%22%20AND%20a%3A%22solr-core%22 Those are only for IDEs to show it in Maven/Gradle projects automatically. The Maven-Javadocs are not useful for browsing, as many information is missing/broken (like inter-module cross-links). ",
