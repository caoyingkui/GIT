There were only problems in the new unit test TestHierarchicalDocBuilder : \n\n\tadding the field root in the dataimport schema.\n\tthe parent filter for the query is now a FixedBitSetCachingWrapperFilter.\n\n\n\nYou can apply this patch in the trunk. \n\nAll unit tests about dih are OK after applying the patch.\n\nIf you want to test, you can add an attribute child at true in the entity tag in the data config file. The entities taggued with child will be added with the addChildDocument method.\nFor example :\n\n<dataConfig>\n  <dataSource type=\"JdbcDataSource\" />\n  <document>\n    <entity name=\"PARENT\" query=\"select * from PARENT\">\n      <field column=\"id\" />\n      <field column=\"desc\" />\n      <field column=\"type_s\" />\n      <entity child=\"true\" name=\"CHILD\" query=\"select * from CHILD where parent_id='${PARENT.id}'\">\n        <field column=\"id\" />\n        <field column=\"desc\" />\n        <field column=\"type_s\" />\n      </entity>\n    </entity>\n  </document>\n</dataConfig>\n\n "

            "content": "Ok, this seemed to work well.  Just a couple of comments/questions.  do I need to add a rootEntity=\"true\"  to the root element, I did that, not sure if that was necessary or not.  In addition, it seems like anything that is marked as required in the schema is required both in the Parent Doc and the Child Doc, is that correct?  Not a big deal, but it does seem a bit odd.  Performance seemed great, both in indexing and in searching.  I adopted a style of using a field content_type to identify parent and child docs so I can specify what I want returned in my fq.  \n\nSide note, when using DIH via the admin screen and you want to load a small number of records, I notice it does a SET ROWCOUNT.  This is great, except that it totally messes up tables that I'm using cacheKeys on as it applies the rowcount to those as well.  Ideally if I had a table setup for caching it would pull those first.  If this is a legit issue I will figure out how to post it to JIRA, but I'm new to JIRA and SOLR.\n "

The number of children on each level is randomized too.\n\nFor the seed I have parentsNum=6 and depth=4 but overall it is a 404305 entities.\n\nI think it is the reason of a fail for a small heap, but going to investigate it further.\n "
