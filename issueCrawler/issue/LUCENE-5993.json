    "description": "Follow-up of LUCENE-5983. We now have 6 doc id set implementations that can be used to cache filter:\n\n\tFixedBitSet\n\tWAH8DocIdSet\n\tPForDeltaDocIdSet\n\tEliasFanoDocIdSet\n\tSparseFixedBitSet\n\tRoaringDocIdSet\n\n\n\nSome of them are required due to unique features that they have (eg. SparseFixedBitSet due to random write-access) but I'm thinking of removing WAH8DocIdSet and PForDeltaDocIdSet since RoaringDocIdSet also has the ability to inverse its encoding in the super-dense case (WAH8 and PForDelta were the only sets to have this ability until now) and tends to be faster to build and to advance.",
