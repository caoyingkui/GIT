    "description": "The problem appears in version 4.3.0 and in revision 1490286.  I\nattached a one-line patch that fixes it.\n\nIn method \"AllGroupHeadsCollectorTest.arrayContains\", the loop over\n\"actual\" should break immediately after \"found\" is set to \"true\".  All\nthe iterations after \"found\" is set to \"true\" do not perform any\nuseful work, at best they just set \"found\" again to \"true\".\n\nMethod \"processWord\" in class \"CapitalizationFilter\" has a similar\nloop (over \"prefix\"), and this loop breaks immediately after \"match\"\nis set to \"false\", just like in the proposed patch.  Other methods\n(e.g., \"Step.apply\", \"JapaneseTokenizer.computePenalty\",\n\"CompressingStoredFieldsWriter.saveInts\", \"FieldQuery.checkOverlap\")\nalso have similar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed\npatch.",
