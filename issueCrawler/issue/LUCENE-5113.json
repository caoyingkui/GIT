            "content": "+1, the little 8KB pending buffers can really add up, e.g. if you have an OrdinalMap over 25 segments (with zero terms!), thats 200KB just for pending[]s.\n\nWe could try to solve it in another way if it makes appending* complicated or would hurt performance, e.g. maybe this map could use some other packed ints api.\n\nThere are a few other places using this buffer though: I think fieldcache term addresses, indexwriter consumers, not sure what else.
