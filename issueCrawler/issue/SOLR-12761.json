    "description": "We had an issue where we reached the expansion limit of the FuzzyQuery.\n\nSituation:\n\n\tQuery \u00abmeier~\u00bb found \u00abMeier\u00bb\n\tQuery \u00abmazer~\u00bb found \u00abMeier\u00bb\n\tQuery \u00abmaxer~\u00bb found \u00abMeier\u00bb\n\tQuery \u00abmayer~\u00bb did NOT find \u00abMeier\u00bb\n\n\n\nThe parameter \u201cmaxBooleanClauses\u201d does not help in this situation since the \u201cmaxExpansions\u201d FuzzyQuery of is never set in Solr and therefore the default value of 50 is used. Details: \u201cSolrQuery-ParserBase\u201d calles the default constructor new FuzzyQuery(Term term, int maxEdits, int pre-fixLength) and therefore FuzzyQuery run always with the default values defaultMaxExpansions = 50 and defaultTranspositions = true)\n\nSuggestion expose FuzzyQuery parameters in solrconfig.xm like e.g. \n <maxBooleanClauses>1024</maxBooleanClauses>\n\nAddtion would be:\n <fuzzyPrefixLength>0</fuzzyPrefixLength>\n <fuzzyMaxExpansions>50</fuzzyMaxExpansions>\n <fuzzyTranspositions>true</fuzzyTranspositions>",
