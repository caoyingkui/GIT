    "description": "This is inspired by a discussion on solr-user. Today, the suggest.build and suggest.reload parameters are all local to the replica receiving the request. This is both confusing and annoying to users because the expectation is that doing so will build/reload the suggest index on all replicas of a collection but the reality is that it happens only on one replica of each shard as per the normal distributed query process. \n\nWe should distribute the build and reload param to all replicas of a collection before actually processing the query.",
