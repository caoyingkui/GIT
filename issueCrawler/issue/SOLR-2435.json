(i haven't dug in enough to check)\n\n(as rmuir said on irc: if the jars are identical, they should compress nicely)\n\nin the ICU4J case, at a minimum we can promote the jar up out of the individual contirbs and into the main \"lib\" dir ... but since it's also in modules, it should be possible to have it copied into the lucene-libs dir (although i'm not totally up to speed on what builds that dir right now) "
