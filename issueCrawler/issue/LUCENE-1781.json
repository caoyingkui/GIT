Ie, in crossing the north pole, the point has moved to the other side of the earth.  We aren't, with the current patch, which I think means the normalization simply bounces the point back where it came from, which doesn't seem right?\n\nAlso, the code has this spooky TODO which looks relevant to this discussion:\n\n\n    // TODO: Prob only works in northern hemisphere?\n\n\n\nI'm a little too nervous to commit this patch as is...

EG, I added 6000 miles as a testcase in TestCartesian, and if I turn off the normalization, it hits the same exception (Illegal lattitude value 94.77745787739758).\n\nAnd I'm still concerned that the normalization fails to properly \"cross\" the north (or south) pole, by flipping the lng whenever the lat is too high; instead it seems to incorrectly \"bounce\" the point back?

Probably if you just modify TestCartesian, to add a new point, and then add a new test cast that starts from a lat/lng that's near the pole, you could get the issue to happen & be resolved.\n\nAlso, can use \"svn diff\" and post the resulting output (instead of the whole copy of each source file)?  Thanks.\n\nThe current Spatial ONLY works for one hemisphere at a time.\n\nActually, shouldn't LLRect work fine if a rect crosses the equator?   Or, a pole?  What I think it cannot handle is crossing the anti-meridian?  (Because, when that projects out, you'll need 2 rectangles, on opposite sides, to handle it?).  I'm not sure what LLRect should even do if it finds it \"needs\" to cross the anti-meridian.  If it had the ability to return 2 rectangles I think it could be fixed.\n\nOr are you saying there are further limitations in contrib/spatial (ie, not caused by LLRect) that cause it to only work within one hemisphere?\n\nAs for the \"we get no results when radius is very large\" bug, I like the theory that the corners need to be flipped.  Or, it could be the rect tried to cross the anti-meridian, and once we fix that, this case will also be fixed.  Finally, it could also be we simply have to floor the the lat after normalizing.  Ie before normalizing we get a ridiculous lat, say 1000.0, which normLat cannot handle since it can only \"undo\" at most \"off by 90\".  I think normLat may need to be changed so that if it still sees lat/lng out of bounds after doing it's normalization, it simply floors the resulting lat?  Can you add a test case for this case as well?  We may as well get test cases for all the problems we're uncovering... then as we iterate on the patches we can see if they are fixed. ",
