From what I understand, if several segments share the same doc store, then when they are merged, the doc stores aren't merged. Which is a great benefit, especially if you intend to store large fields.\n\nI understand (mostly from the discussion on the PTDW) that with the move to a per-thread approach, the doc stores cannot be shared between segments created by different threads, but what about segments created by the same thread?

However we can keep the reading of shared doc stores for\nback compat. I think the confusing part in the code is the\nwriting of shared doc stores, and I'm glad that's going away. In\naddition the DWPT code completely streamlines some of the most\nconfusing parts of the IndexWriter class tree (the wait notify,\nand per thread logic in particular). Overall this will help\nfuture folks when they're trying to customize IndexWriter, and\nin addition, remove a layer of complexity, as we add yet another\nlayer of complexity with the RT code. ",

Are we losing that functionality?\n\nWe discussed that in LUCENE-2324 (close to the bottom).  The problem is that doc stores only help you if you merge segments that all share the same store.  With DWPT that's extremely unlikely.  \n\n\n\nWhat are the performance implications of removing shared doc stores? \n\nI agree we have to test this when this patch is complete.  My hope is that we save in other places (removing the interleaving step of the per-thread postings, no wait queue that serializes writing to doc stores) so that overall we won't be slower. ",
