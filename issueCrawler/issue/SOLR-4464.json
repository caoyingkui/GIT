The memory that is not used for programs gets used by the OS to cache data on the disk for performance reasons.  If a program or the OS requests additional memory, the OS will happily and instantly give up the lowest priority cache data to satisfy the memory request.\n\nYour Solr admin page seems to be locked up while trying to load the dashboard, so I can't see the actual numbers.  I hope everything is OK. "

There are no Solr errors and MySQL seems to have no issue with the queries. A screenshot of the counter at zero after two+ hours of error-free processing is attached, though I can't seem to find where it went on JIRA (now I see, it's under \"Attachments\" above the comments).\n\nThis may be a fairly common problem.
