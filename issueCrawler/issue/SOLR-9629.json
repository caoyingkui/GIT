Other than some simple fixes, includes a fix to use a MultiPartEntityBuilder to create rather than using a deprecated constructor on MultiPartEntity.",

            "content": "What's the rationale of changing the Long creation in BinaryRequestWriter to a cast to the primitive type?  Java will need to autobox the long to Long in order to return the value.\n\nI'm not saying the change is wrong, because I honestly do not know which way has better performance or fits better with Java norms ... I just would like to know why that change is there.  I don't see any warning on the code in eclipse, which typically has many more warnings than javac. ",
