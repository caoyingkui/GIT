    "description": "Move facets associations to the new bulk FacetsAggregator API. Also, today when you index categories with associations, the categories are written to two fields redundantly - the associations field and the counting list field. However, when you aggregate them, you only need to read the associations field. The counting list field is redundant here.\n\nIf an app requires indexing the categories into two lists, it can do so by adding the categories w/ associations using AssociationFacetFields and the plain categories (w/ their hierarchy etc.) using FacetFields.\n\nI will post a patch shortly.",
