    "description": "When running the MapReduceIndexerTool, it will usually pull a solrconfig.xml from ZK for the collection that it is running against. This can be problematic for several reasons:\n\n\n\tPerformance: The configuration in ZK will likely have several query handlers, and lots of other components that don't make sense in an indexing-only use of EmbeddedSolrServer (ESS).\n\tClasspath Resources: If the Solr services are using some kind of additional service (such as Sentry for auth) then the indexer will not have access to the necessary configurations without the user jumping through several hoops.\n\tDistinct Configuration Needs: Enabling Soft Commits on the ESS doesn't make sense. There's other configurations that\n\tUpdate Chain Behaviours: I'm under the impression that UpdateChains may behave differently in ESS than a SolrCloud cluster. Is it safe to depend on consistent behaviour here?",

The embedded config features a minimal operational footprint, disabling most request handlers, update chains, and soft commits. It can be overridden by explicitly specifying a --solr-home-dir argument on the command line when launching the job. ",

Should this be 6.0.0 for trunk, 5.something for branch_5x?  (I assume you want it in both, tell me if that's incorrect)\n\n\nTo enable dynamic schema REST APIs, use the following for <schemaFactory>:\n+\n+       <schemaFactory class=\"ManagedIndexSchemaFactory\">\n+         <bool name=\"mutable\">true</bool>\n+         <str name=\"managedSchemaResourceName\">managed-schema</str>\n+       </schemaFactory>\n\n\nDoes this work with managed  schemas?  What about if the resource name isn't the default?\n\n\n+  <!-- JMX\n+\n+       This example enables JMX if and only if an existing MBeanServer\n+       is found, use this if you want to configure JMX through JVM\n+       parameters.

What about adding a test for the new option (--use-zk-solrconfig.xml).  Maybe something simple like have your own update chain that adds a field/value that you expect to see.  And possibly the converse, where you add an update.chain and check that the new behavior is actually working, i.e. that it doesn't use the solrconfig in zk. ",

Trying to enumerate all the possibilities - use embedded solrconfig, use solrconfig from zk, use solrconfig from solr home dir, got really messy, so I tried to hedge. I'm now leaning toward it being worth the additional complexity in documentation to spell everything out explicitly but don't have a good handle on it.\n\nI'm not sure about working with managed schemas. I can remove the comment to prevent confusion - it was originally copied from another example file.\n\nJMX on MapReduce tasks can be enabled through mapreduce.map.java.opts - I've seen it used for attempting to monitor memory usage. If somebody wants to try to do this, then I don't intend to give them more hoops to jump through. If jmx is disabled, then I think we end up ignoring that directive, so it's fine.\n\nI will look at how we can add additional tests to verify everything. ",
