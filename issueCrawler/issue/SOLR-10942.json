Have handleSelect=false in <requestDispatcher> (hopefully it'll default to this and/or go away some day soon).  \n\nBoth of the queries you issued are actually going to /select and thus have no qf/df and so it was in error since your query was otherwise ambiguous as to which field.  This is an example, by the way, of how removing the defaultSearchField from the schema (now gone in 7.0) is a good thing.  It surfaces incorrect queries faster. ",

See SOLR-3161 for background on the restriction. Also, with 7.0 release soon to come, handleSelect will default to false and is gone from examples and will probably vanish in 8.0, see SOLR-6807... ",
