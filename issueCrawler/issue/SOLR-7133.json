Very likely flume has a way to send the commit, but I have no experience with it, so I do not know where.\n\nhttp://lucidworks.com/blog/understanding-transaction-logs-softcommit-and-commit-in-sorlcloud/\n\nThat article title says \"SolrCloud\" but the concepts are applicable to Solr in general.\n\nWhat I've found to be good autoCommit settings are: 1) autoCommit with a maxTime of five to fifteen minutes and openSearcher set to false.  2) autoSoftCommit with a maxTime that represents the most time you can stand to wait for new documents to show up.  I personally would not configure autoSoftCommit with an interval shorter than one minute.\n\nmaxTime is in milliseconds, so five minutes is 300000. ",

A new searcher has not been opened, so the original searcher will be used for searches, and it is not aware of the new segments created by the updates and the commit.  Adding autoSoftCommit to the config as well as autoCommit should solve this problem, but if you want all of the updates in a particular batch to be done before the changes are visible, then it might not be the right thing to do.\n\nI bet that your autoCommit setting which has a maxTime of 15000 also has openSearcher set to false.  With this config, you will never see your new documents unless your update process sends an explicit commit with openSearcher=true, or you restart Solr.\n\nI don't know what to say about the flume batchDurationMillis setting.  You will need to find a support venue for flume.\n\nhttp://flume.apache.org/mailinglists.html\n\nIf you want to continue this discussion about Solr, please use the mailing list or IRC.

Soft commits and the transaction log are new features in 4.x.  Those new features required the addition of the openSearcher feature.\n\nThe openSearcher value controls whether or not a new searcher will be opened when the commit finishes \u2013 whether any changes to the index will be visible or not.

Solr itself defaults to openSearcher=true when you send a commit to the update handler, or if you do not specify openSearcher on the autoCommit config.\n\nSince 4.0, we strongly recommend using openSearcher=false with autoCommit.  The idea behind that recommendation is that Solr will automatically do commits that start new transaction logs but it will not automatically make new documents visible.  There are other mechanisms for document visibility.\n\nIf you want to automatically do commits for document visibility, you have two choices: use autoSoftCommit, or use the commitWithin parameter on your update requests.  You always have the option of making your application entirely responsible for document visibility by sending manual soft commits.  It can do hard commits too, but if you have autoCommit, there's no reason to do the more expensive hard commits.\n\nBecause this is not a bug and I've covered all the important discussion points about commits, I will offer no more advice here.  Use the mailing list or the IRC channel.  I am present on both. ",
