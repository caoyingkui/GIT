    "description": "I'm writing a test wherein I call solrClient.getClusterStateProvider().getState(collectionName)\u00a0and in certain cases it can throw an NPE due to no zkStateReader. \u00a0Apparently it wasn't connect()'ed first. \u00a0I think this is a design flaw \u2013 no\u00a0connect() method ought to be needed IMO. \u00a0It needs to connect, sure, but can't that\u00a0detail be handled completely internally to the provider impl? \u00a0ZkClientClusterStateProvider.getZkStateReader could become what connect() is right now, and then all code in ZkClientClusterStateProvider that needs the zkStateReader should call that method and not access the field directly.",
