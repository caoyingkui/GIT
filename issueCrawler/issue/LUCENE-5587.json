            "content": "OK two things:\n\n\n\tWith this seed, the first index flushes only a single segment, and so forceMerge does nothing.  This is unusual (often, RandomIndexWriter will do a random commit with atLeast(500) docs).\n\n\n\n\n\tWhen flushing, we write according to HashMap iterator order (undefined), while for merging we write according to FieldInfos iteration order, and so the .dat file holding the doc values has the fields in a different order, which results in a different checksum.  Furthermore, the checksums have a different number of digits, and this explains why it's only SimpleText that's failing here (the other formats do a .writeLong for the checksum so the byte length will be the same).\n\n\n\nWe could ... disable this checking for SimpleText (not ideal), or, we could fix SimpleText to 0 or space pad its checksum line (I prefer this option).
