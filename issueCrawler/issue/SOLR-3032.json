    "description": "There seems to be a growing consensus (well, Muir and Hoss agree at least) that having this logOnce concept in SolrException is more trouble than it's worth. Point in case is that trunk (4x) fails to report anything useful in the log file when you define a custom component and don't have any <lib> statements going to the right place.\n\nSo the proposal is to remove the whole logOnce process, supporting variables etc. The first step here will be deprecating the various bits of code in SolrException and starting to remove their usages.\n\nI'm opening this up for discussion, error reporting seems to be one of those things that generates endless discussion and I'd like them aired before putting too much work into this. My goal will be to have this in the code base by next Tuesday, so speak up.",

            "content": "OK, here's a first cut. The rule I tried to follow (and I need to go over it again with fresh eyes) was that if an exception was re-thrown, logging was unnecessary so I took it out.\n\nAs a bonus, SolrConfig.severeErrors is gone as is all the stuff around CoreContainer.abortOnConfigurationError.\n\nMost of this is unutterably boring, but take a look at SolrDispatchFilter, the real changes are there.\n\nI'll add deprecation notices to the 3x code, but won't change anything else there.\n\nI'm putting this out for comments. All tests pass, but I'm not sure tests do much to deal with logging so that probably only proves that things compile.\n\nI'll look this over again tomorrow, then I expcet I'll commit on Sunday/Monday unless there are howls of protest.\n\nAnd I just want to add that modern IDEs make this far too easy. \"Back in MY day\", real programmers used real editors.
