    "description": "This patch\n\n\tconverts all analysis tests to use the new tokenstream api\n\tconverts most tests to use the more stringent assertion mechanisms from lucene\n\tadds new tests to improve coverage\n\n\n\nMost bugs found by more stringent testing have been fixed, with the exception of SynonymFilter.\nThe problems with this filter are more serious, the previous tests were essentially a no-op.\nThe new tests for SynonymFilter test the current behavior, but have FIXMEs with what I think the old test wanted to expect in the comments.",
