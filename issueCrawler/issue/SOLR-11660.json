But is to restore collection and then to renew index from application - we have new index on follower and old index on leader.\nThe Reload on collection helps to make index up-to-date on leader.\nIn logs we have o.a.s.u.p.DistributedUpdateProcessor Ignoring commit while not ACTIVE - state: BUFFERING replay: false\nIf to restart solr service before collection update from application - index on all solr servers is updated.",

I created a 'techproducts' collection with 4 shards, 2 replicas, indexed the example docs to it, then followed the reproduction steps.  I got this error trying to restore, which is a separate issue:\n\n\"org.apache.solr.common.SolrException:org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Solr cloud with available number of nodes:2 is insufficient for restoring a collection with 4 shards, total replicas per shard 1 and maxShardsPerNode -1. Consider increasing maxShardsPerNode value OR number of available nodes.\"\n\nThen I added parameters to the restore command, including replicationFactor=2, but when it got restored, there was only one replica.  So I'm not sure what I need to do in order to get two replicas. ",
