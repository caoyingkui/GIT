    "description": "While working on SOLR-7789, I realized it would be easier if I split up the OverseerCollectionProcessor into two parts:\n\n1) General handling of tasks (work queues, etc)\n2) Processing a collection handler request\n\nI haven't decided whether the ConfigSet should have its own processor, i.e. OverseerConfigSetProcessor or reuse at least the thread for the OverseerCollectionProcessor, but in either case this refactoring will be helpful.  That is, if the ConfigSet processing has its own processing, I can reuse the general handling of tasks part.  If the ConfigSet processing reuses the OverseerCollectionProcessing thread, I won't complicate the implementation with ConfigSet operations.",

            "content": "Here's a patch.  Review request: https://reviews.apache.org/r/37057/.\n\nSplits up the OverseerCollectionProcessor as follows:\n\n\n\tDefines an interface OverseerMessageHandler for handling messages sent to the overseer queues\n\tOverseerCollectionMessageHandler handles collection related messages (i.e. this is just the message handling code from the old OverseerCollectionProcessor code)\n\tOverseerProcessor is the task management related code from the old OverseerCollectionProcessor\n\tOverseerProcessor.OverseerMessageHandlerSelector is an interface for selecting an OverseerMessageHandler for an incoming message.  This would allows us to handle multiple types of message (e.g. Collection / ConfigSet) with the same OverseerProcessor\n\tOverseerCollectionProcessor is now just an OverseerProcessor with an OverseerMessageHandlerSelector that always selects an OverseerCollectionMessageHandler for processing.\n\n\n\nOne complication is with prioritizeOverseerNodes, which doesn't really fit into this new model or the existing model (it doesn't really have anything to do directly with collections AFAICT, though the CollectionProcessor handles messages about it).  This should probably be moved somewhere else and is a pain because both the OverseerProcessor (before running the task loop) and the CollectionMessageHandler (to respond to ADDROLE ops) call it.  For now I moved the code to an OverseerNodePrioritizer that is passed into both those objects, though I'm open for suggestions there.\n\nOtherwise, just some renaming of imports from OverseerCollectionProcessor to OverseerCollectionMessageHandler.\n\nI was originally going to put all the new classes in the cloud.overseer package but there are some package-level info that is needed and for some reason, all the overseer related code isn't there.  I'm okay with moving everything there if that's what we want to do.\n\nThis patch should have no effect on end users. ",

Now seemed like a good time because we are moving around a bunch of code anyway (which complicates the history to a certain extent).  So if we can do it at one time, that's ideal.  I'll investigate how feasible that is. ",

We have a bunch of Overseer* classes in a cloud package instead of an existing cloud.overseer package.\n\nTo be more specific on my complaint (a lot of which I'm am the cause of), a bunch of classes are jammed in the core and cloud packages that could surely be broken up into packages in a more useful fashion. The CollectionsOverseerProcesser is just one example where little thought was used. Seems like a good thing to fix this in this case. ",
