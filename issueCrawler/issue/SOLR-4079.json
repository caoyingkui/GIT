With long names like that, the sidebar will massively overshoot its boundaries and intrude so far into the main pane that it interferes with UI inputs and controls.\n\nFixing this issue is trivial even within the browser, by introducing a custom stylesheet.",

            "content": "The default 150px is very small. Only a handful of characters can fit in that space, so an increase in size would be welcome. After all, the sidebar is the only part with a hardcoded width and the main contents to the right of it grows with the browser window. I have a sidebar of 150px and main content of more than 1200px visible. I realize that my 27\" screen isn't common, but the fact remain that there is a very strong weighing to the main contents and it will always be a lot larger than the sidebar.\n\nThe title attribute is a very nice touch, however!
