            "content": "setUseCompoundFile can only be invoked if the merge policy is an instance of LogMergePolicy. So if the policy is not LogMergePolicy, we can't call that setter regardless of the value of useCompoundFile. The previous patch is wrong because it will call setUseCompoundFile(false) even if policy is not LogMergePolicy.\n\nI think throwing an exception would be wrong because that would mean the policy must always derive from LogMergePolicy. This patch logs a warning that if policy is not an instance of LogMergePolicy, the value of useCompoundFile is not used and the configured policy's defaults will take effect. "
