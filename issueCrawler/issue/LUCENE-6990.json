    "description": "I would like to setup the lucene store to a MongoDB installation.\nIt already exists an old project which gives this possiblity:\nhttps://github.com/rstiller/mongo-lucene\n\nUnfortunately this project is stuck to the old version of Mondo DB and does not run anymore. Newest version of MongoDB now uses new classes like GridFSBuckets and MongoDatabase (replacing the old classes GridFS and MongoDB).\n\nHere an example of usage:\nhttp://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.2/driver/reference/gridfs/\n\nCan you please implement a MongoDBDirectory?\n\nBecause I am not sure which team (Lucene or MongoDB one) can better take care of this request, I am opening a copy of this request to the other team too (see external issue URL).\n\nBest regards",
