Though, you need relatively high density of deletions to see that.  Also, no matter what when you cross an indexed term, the binary search will be done.  I'll genericize the language in the CHANGES entry.\n\nAnd actually this reminds to go make sure the flex branch is doing this optimization too... ",

Solr, for instance, can't tell if there are any duplicates when building an index from scratch, so it must use update().  There is a way to tell Solr not to enforce duplicate overwriting (overwrite=false param) but I doubt many people do that, and it risks user error (using it when there are dups in the docs being added, or already in the index).
