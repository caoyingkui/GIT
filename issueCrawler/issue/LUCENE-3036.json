    "description": "This test:\n\n\tuses FSDirectory.open (platform-specific behavior)\n\tis a random test, but runs to a certain amount of seconds, then quits (makes it hard to reproduce with seed, as its behavior is dependent on your computers speed etc)\n\n\n\nAfter waiting 3 hours to download the 1 gigabyte file to reproduce the corrupt index it made in (https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/1533/testReport/junit/org.apache.lucene.util.automaton.fst/TestFSTs/testRealTerms/), I found some of this frustrating.\n\nI managed to finally reproduce it but its no fun fiddling with a test that runs for 5 minutes to reproduce a fail.",
