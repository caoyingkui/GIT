Returns the block number of the term. */\n    public int getBlockAndFill(BytesRef b, long start) \n//    was: public BytesRef fillUsingLengthPrefix2(BytesRef b, long start) \n\n/** @lucene.internal  Reads length as 1 or 2 byte vInt prefix, starting @ start. \n     * Returns the start offset of the next part, suitable as start parameter on next call\n     * to sequentially read all BytesRefs. */\n    public long getNextOffsetAndFill(BytesRef b, long start) \n//    was: public BytesRef fillUsingLengthPrefix3(BytesRef b, long start)",
