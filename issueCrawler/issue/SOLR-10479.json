    "description": "If a request sends no timeAllowed threshold (or if it sends a very generous threshold) then that request can potentially be retried on 'very many' servers in the cloud.\n\nVia the HttpShardHandlerFactory.loadBalancerRequests(MinimumAbsolute|MaximumFraction) options the number of servers tried can be restricted via configuration e.g.\n\n<shardHandlerFactory name=\"shardHandlerFactory\" class=\"solr.HttpShardHandlerFactory\">\n  <int   name=\"loadBalancerRequestsMinimumAbsolute\">2</int>\n  <float name=\"loadBalancerRequestsMaximumFraction\">0.50</float>\n</shardHandlerFactory>\n\n\nwould on a six-replica-and-all-replicas-active collection/shard restrict sending to three replicas i.e. max(2, 0.50 x 6) and if the collection/shard temporarily becomes three-replicas-active-and-three-replicas-recovering-or-down then sending is restricted to two replicas i.e. max(2, 0.50 x 3) temporarily.",
