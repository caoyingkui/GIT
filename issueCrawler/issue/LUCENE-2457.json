    "description": "Discussed on thread: http://markmail.org/thread/gjqk35t7e3y4fo5j\n\n\"QueryNode(s) are data objects, and it makes sense to override\ntheir equals method. But before, we need to define what is a QueryNode\nequality. Should two nodes be considered equal if they represent\nsyntactically or semantically the same query? e.g. an ORQueryNode created\nfrom the query <a OR b OR c> will not have the same children ordering as the\nquery <b OR c OR a>, so they are syntactically not equal, but they are\nsemantically equal, because the order of the OR operands (usually) does not\nmatter when the query is executed. I say it usually does not matter, because\nit's up to the Query object implementation built from that ORQueryNode\nobject, for this reason, I vote for defining that two query nodes should be\nequals if they are syntactically equal.\n\nI also vote for excluding query node tags from the equality check, because\nthey are not meant to represent the query structure, but to attach extra\ninfo to the node, which is usually used for communication between\nprocessors.\"",
