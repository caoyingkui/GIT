From my point of view there is only one blocker left here (LUCENE-3028) so the remaining work is mainly reviewing the current state and polishing the javadocs. I will go over IW, IR and DW java docs as a start. ",

Wow.\n\nThis is on a machine that has substantial CPU+IO concurrency, ie, it\nwas bottlenecked by our non-concurrent flush.\n\nAlso, I can now tune up the IW settings I use in those nightly\nbenchmarks; it's now 6 threads and \"only\" 512 MB RAM buffer.  I'll\nwait a few days and then do that.\n\nLooks like a few queries got a bit slower... I suspect this is because\nthe index segment count has changed.
