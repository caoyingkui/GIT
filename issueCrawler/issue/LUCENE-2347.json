    "description": "This enhancement allows you to dump v2 of WordNet to SOLR synonym format! Get all your syns loaded easily.\n\n1. You can load all synonyms from http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/2.0/ WordNet V2 to SOLR by first using the Sys2Index program\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/api/org/apache/lucene/wordnet/Syns2Index.html\n\nGet WNprolog from http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/2.0/\n\n2. We modified this program to work with SOLR (See attached) on amidev.kaango.com in /vol/src/lucene/contrib/wordnet\nvi /vol/src/lucene/contrib/wordnet/src/java/org/apache/lucene/wordnet/Syns2Solr.java\n\n3. Run ant\n\n4. java -classpath /vol/src/lucene/build/contrib/wordnet/lucene-wordnet-3.1-dev.jar org.apache.lucene.wordnet.Syns2Solr prolog/wn_s.pl solr > index_synonyms.txt",
