JIRAs are not helpdesk tickets. It's considered polite to make some effort to determine that it's actually a code problem before raising a JIRA. There's no evidence you've made any such effort. This is usually accomplished by bringing the problem up on the user's list to see if your understanding is correct first.\n\nbq:  it would be nice if you could explain what you mean with \"Hyphens are not disabled\". \n\nFrom the example on this page (the very first document found by googling for worddelimiterfilterfactory): http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters#solr.WordDelimiterFilterFactory\n\nSplits words into subwords and performs optional transformations on subword groups. By default, words are split into subwords with the following rules:\n\nsplit on intra-word delimiters (all non alpha-numeric characters).\n\"Wi-Fi\" -> \"Wi\", \"Fi\"\n\n\nFrom the very first comment in the class: \"split on intra-word delimiters (by default, all non alpha-numeric characters): \". \n\n\n\nI really advise you read:\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/UsingMailingLists "
