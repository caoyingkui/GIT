    "description": "A user on the solr-user mailing list back in June brought up the fact that IBM has bought Alchemy and keys are no longer available to use Solr's UIMA contrib.\n\nSomeone recently made a similar comment to the Solr Ref Guide page and asking for a patch.\n\nI know next to nothing about UIMA, but figured it's worth an issue to determine what to do here. I think folks are saying it's no longer usable? Or maybe only usable by people who already have keys (which will possibly expire at some point)?\n\nAnyone have an idea what needs to be done here? It seems we should have some kind of answer, but if it's no longer usable perhaps we should retire the contrib.",

As fascinated as I was by UIMA, I think that is an example of a feature that doesn't really fit into the mainline use cases for Solr, otherwise the upgrade to UIMA 3.x would have happened before now.\n\nI suspect that the best thing would be a proper indexing pipeline that encompasses the use cases for Tika, UIMA, the ScriptingUpdateRequestHandler and friends?   \n\nThen you could have the UIMA plugin be it's own project with it's own dedicated folks...
