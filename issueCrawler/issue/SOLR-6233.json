    "description": "As part of the start script development work SOLR-3617, example restructuring SOLR-3619, and the overall curb appeal work SOLR-4430, I'd like to have an option on the SystemInfoHandler that gives a shorter, well formatted JSON synopsis of essential information. I know \"essential\" is vague  but right now using curl to http://host:port/solr/admin/info/system?wt=json gives too much information when I just want a synopsis of a Solr server. \n\nMaybe something like &overview=true?\n\nResult would be:\n\n\n{\n  \"address\": \"http://localhost:8983/solr\",\n  \"mode\": \"solrcloud\",\n  \"zookeeper\": \"localhost:2181/foo\",\n  \"uptime\": \"2 days, 3 hours, 4 minutes, 5 seconds\",\n  \"version\": \"5.0-SNAPSHOT\",\n  \"status\": \"healthy\",\n  \"memory\": \"4.2g of 6g\"\n}\n\n\n\nNow of course, one may argue all this information can be easily parsed from the JSON but consider cross-platform command-line tools that don't have immediate access to a JSON parser, such as the bin/solr start script.",

Of course we'd need to rename it to SolrTools but having the full power of Java at our disposal from the start script seems like a better long-term solution vs. one-offs like what I proposed in this ticket. The Tools code serves two purposes: 1) a set of built-in tools such as healthcheck and 2) a framework for building out custom tools that are launched / managed in a consistent fashion. "

            "content": "The best thing about using Java beyond having to have an extensive unix and windows script is that it's much easier to add to our unit tests, which is an important step if we want to have these scripts as first class. We can get a lot of milage from the release checking scripts as well I think, but much nicer to have a heavily unit tested chunk of java code.  "
