    "description": "In LUCENE-1575 we've changed the HitCollector API to Collector, as well as decoupled score from collect(). Also, we've allowed TopFieldCollector to not track document scores and maxScore. For back-compat reasons we kept defaults to true (i.e., track scores), but should remove them in 3.0.\nThis issue will handle all the 3.0 targeted changes.",
