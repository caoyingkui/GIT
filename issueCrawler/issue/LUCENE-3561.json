    "description": "When building src.jar files for maven deploy, they miss resources, so analyzers-sommon-src.jar is useless.\n\nThe attached patch will fix this. The only downside is: The globmapper hack does not work with <jar/>, so i used the new ANT 1.7.1 attribute erroronmissingdir=\"no\" on the <fileset>s\n\nI also upgraded BUILD.txt, which were missing even java 1.6 in trunk!",
