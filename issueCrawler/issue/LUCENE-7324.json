    "description": "I looked at ExitableDirectoryReader and to me checking the timeout on every term is a pretty heavy operation. I wonder if we can relax that a bit and begin with checking when we pull Terms and maybe only every Nth term by default? I wonder if we even can make it a function of the number of therms ie log(numTerms) I think it's pretty trappy to have something that won't perform well or has the risk to not scale well in lucene core?",
