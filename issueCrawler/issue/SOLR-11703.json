We have a large number of support tickets that wind up with us having the client increase this number... programatically.  \n It would make sense and save a great deal of support time if the solr startup script checked these values, and either alter them, or at least alert the user to the fact that they are set too low, which could cause trouble  I am associating just one of many tickets where this is the result.",
