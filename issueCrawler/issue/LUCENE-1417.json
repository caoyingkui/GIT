    "description": "Spelling suggestions are currently ordered first by a string edit distance measure, then by popularity/frequency.  This limits the ability of popularity/frequency to affect suggestions.  I think it would be better for the distance measure to accept popularity/frequency as an argument and provide a distance/score that incorporates any popularity/frequency considerations.  I.e. change StringDistance.getDistance to accept an additional argument: frequency of the potential suggestion.\n\nThe new SuggestWord.compareTo function would only order by score.  We could achieve the existing behavior by adding a small inverse frequency value to the distances.",
