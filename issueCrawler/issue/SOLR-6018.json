    "description": "There is an issue with org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.DocBuilder:addFields around ~line 643.  The logic currently says see if you can find the field from the schema, ie:\n\nDocBuilder.java\nSchemaField sf = schema.getFieldOrNull(key);\n\n\n\nand, if not found, go ask DIHConfiguration to find it, ie:\n\nDocBuilder.java\nsf = config.getSchemaField(key);\n\n\n\nThe latter call takes into account case-insensitivity, which is a big deal since some databases, ie: DB2, upper case all the resulting column names.  In order to not modify solr-core (ie: the match logic in IndexSchema), I'm attaching a patch that makes DIHConfiguration apply the same case-insensitive logic to the DynamicFields.\n\nWithout this patch, dynamic fields will not be added to the index unless you declare them like this:\n\n\n  <dynamicField name=\"*_S\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" />\n\n\n\n(note the capital S)\n\nwhich is in-consistent with what I believe to be solr schema conventions to have all the schema fields as lower-case.\n\nThanks.",
