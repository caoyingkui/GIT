    "description": "It has come to my attention that the phrase identifier introduced in SOLR-9418 does not return phrases that are found in\u00a0only one of the fields specified by phrases.fields.\n This has proved troublesome for our use case.\n The offending line seems to be\n\nfinal List<Phrase> validScoringPhrasesSorted = contextData.allPhrases.stream()\n  .filter(p -> 0.0D < p.getTotalScore())\n  .sorted(Comparator.comparing((p -> p.getTotalScore()), Collections.reverseOrder()))\n  .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\nSince fields where the phrase is not present return -1.0, and fields that contain the phrase return a score in the range of 0.0 <= score >= 1.0, the total score turn out negative, and the phrase gets filtered.\n I changed separated the filters to 2 distinct cases:\n\n\tFilter out single word phrases (phrases.singleWordPhrases is set to false)\n\tInclude single word phrases (phrases.singleWordPhrases is set to true)\n\n\n\nThis can be observed by this change to the component's logid:\n\nif(!rb.req.getParams().getBool(PHRASE_MATCH_SINGLE_WORD, false)) {\n      // filter single word phrases\n      phraseStream = contextData.allPhrases.stream()\n          .filter(p -> p.fieldScores.values().stream().anyMatch(fieldScore -> fieldScore > 0.0D));\n} else {\n      // include single word phrases, which return a constant score of 0.0\n      phraseStream = contextData.allPhrases.stream()\n          .filter(p -> p.fieldScores.values().stream().anyMatch(fieldScore -> fieldScore >= 0.0D));\n}",
