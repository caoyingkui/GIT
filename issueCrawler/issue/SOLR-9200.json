    "description": "SOLR-7468 added support for kerberos authentication via the hadoop authentication filter.  Hadoop also has support for an authentication filter that supports delegation tokens, which allow authenticated users the ability to grab/renew/delete a token that can be used to bypass the normal authentication path for a time.  This is useful in a variety of use cases:\n1) distributed clients (e.g. MapReduce) where each client may not have access to the user's kerberos credentials.  Instead, the job runner can grab a delegation token and use that during task execution.\n2) If the load on the kerberos server is too high, delegation tokens can avoid hitting the kerberos server after the first request\n3) If requests/permissions need to be delegated to another user: the more privileged user can request a delegation token that can be passed to the less privileged user.\n\nNote to self:\nIn https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-7468?focusedCommentId=14579636&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14579636 I made the following comment which I need to investigate further, since I don't know if anything changed in this area:\n3) I'm a little concerned with the \"NoContext\" code in KerberosPlugin moving forward (I understand this is more a generic auth question than kerberos specific). For example, in the latest version of the filter we are using at Cloudera, we play around with the ServletContext in order to pass information around (https://github.com/cloudera/lucene-solr/blob/cdh5-4.10.3_5.4.2/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/servlet/SolrHadoopAuthenticationFilter.java#L106). Is there any way we can get the actual ServletContext in a plugin?",

            "content": "Functionality:\n\n1) This patch allows configuration of delegation tokens for the KerberosPlugin.  Existing\nconfigurations will not change and will not support delegation tokens.\n\nThe configuration parameters are as follows:\n\n\n\nKey\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\nsolr.kerberos.delegation.token.enabled\nboolean\nfalse\nSet to true to enable delegation tokens\n\n\nsolr.kerberos.delegation.token.kind\nString\nsolr-dt\nType name of delegation tokens, most likely doesn't need to change\n\n\nsolr.kerberos.delegation.token.validity\ninteger\n36000\nLifetime in seconds for which delegation tokens are valid\n\n\nsolr.kerberos.delegation.token.signer.secret.provider\nString\nzookeeper\nWhere delegation token information is stored internally; if not \"zookeeper\" delegation tokens won't work across solr servers\n\n\nsolr.kerberos.delegation.token.signer.secret.provider.zookeper.path\nString\n(chrooted path) + /token\nZookeeper location where secret provider information is stored\n\n\nsolr.kerberos.delegation.token.secret.manager.znode.working.path\nString\n(chrooted path) + /zkdtsm\nZookeeper location where token information is stored\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Includes solrj support for delegation tokens as follows:\n  a) DelegationTokenRequest/DelegationTokenResponse can be used to get/cancel/renew delegation tokens\n  b) HttpSolrClient.Builder now includes a \"withDelegationToken\" function for creating an HttpSolrClient\n     that uses a delegation token to authenticate\n  Note that hadoop's delegation token responses are in json map format, so there is a new ResponseParser\n  for that in DelegationTokenResponse; I couldn't find an existing response parser that worked\n\nIssues / Workarounds:\n\n3) AuthenticationPlugin has an incompatible change that means this should only go into the next major version.\nBasically:\n\nvoid doAuthenticate\n\nchanged to:\n\nboolean doAuthenticate\n\nThis is to support cases where authentication succeeds, but solr itself shouldn't process the request; e.g.\nin the delegation token management operations (get, cancel, renew).  The boolean, if false, indicates a short\ncircuit out of the rest of the solr dispatch logic.\n\n4) DelegationTokenKerberosFilter includes a workaround for null query strings.  The versions of\nhadoop / httpclient that we use don't work with null HttpServletRequest query strings, which the jetty\nversion we use can provide.  This can be solved by using HTTPCLIENT-1746 (not released yet) or HADOOP-12767\n(not released in a stable version).\n\n5) hadoop's delegation token code writes to a closed PrintWriter; this doesn't seem to be a problem for the\nversion of jetty that hadoop uses, but it causes an issue with our version.  I filed HADOOP-13346 to fix that,\nuntil then, I wrote a PrintWriterWrapper that ignores closes.\n\n6) The hadoop zookeeper delegation token code uses Curator rather than SolrZkClient; the conversion\nfrom SolrZkClient is messy in a few places:\n  a) We use the ZkController.ZkClient's ACL Provider for the delegation tokens in ZK, but it's not obvious this\n    is what you'd actually want to use.  For example, it may be reasonable to have most solr znodes be readable\n    (because clients read e.g. clusterstate.json), but you probably don't want the delegation token information\n    to be readable by anyone outside \"solr\".  I haven't checked recently, but I don't think we provide any\n    built in ACLProviders that would do something reasonable here in the general case.  Basically, it's easy to\n    get this wrong and leak security information.\n  b) Getting credentials information to curator also isn't great.  Again, we use ZkController.ZkClient's credentials\n    (at AuthenticationPlugin.init) time, but given the \"setZkCredentialsToAddAutomatically\" function, these could\n    in theory change.  I haven't looked into changing that into a builder so it's guaranteed not to change.\n  c) Retrying logic is handled completely differently.  In theory, you'd like the curator logic to follow ZkController.ZkClient's\n     ZkClientConnectionStrategy logic, but it's not clear how to implement this.  Instead, we just use curator's ExponentialBackoffRetry. ",

Afair, we've done such incompatible changes in the past within 5x (when we were working on the BasicAuth functionality. Sorry, I don't have the exact JIRAs handy at the moment). Any 3rd party authentication plugins would suffer, but it should be immediately obvious to the developers how to fix it. ",

            "content": "Apologies for delay in the review; I have caught on a viral infection and have still not fully recovered. Here are some comments from before I fell sick.\n\n\n\tCan we eliminate the NoContext and replace with AttributeOnlyServletContext?\n\tI think it makes sense to write a test for internode communication to ensure that delegation tokens based authentication is working end to end. The TestSolrCloudWithDelegationTokens seems to use a 2 node mini solr cloud cluster, but it wasn't apparent to me if there are any calls made to the cluster from the test that require internode communication (maybe there is and I've missed it).\n\tHow can we ensure that no HttpSolrClients are created from elsewhere in Solr while delegation tokens based kerberos authentication is enabled (so that DTs are always passed on)? Do you think we should ban the creation of HSCs, and provide for a factory method?\n\tI see there are various places in Solr codebase where HSCs are created, e.g. SnitchContext, LeaderInitiatedRecoveryThread, OverseerAutoReplicaFailoverThread, OverseerCollectionMessageHandler, RecoveryStrategy, SyncStrategy, IndexFetcher, CdcrRequestHandler, CdcrUpdateLogSynchronizer, SolrConfigHandler, ManagedSchema, SolrCmdDistributor. These are for internode communication, but these clients do not get the delegation tokens passed on while making the request. Shouldn't they be using delegation tokens too, to make it consistent?\n\tMinor: Unused imports in AuthenticationPlugin\n\tMinor: Unnecessary change to SolrZkClient\n\tTestSolrCloudWithDelegationTokens:\n\nSystem.setProperty(KerberosPlugin.DELEGATION_TOKEN_PARAM, \"true\"); \n\n\nline has been repeated in the test\n\t\n solr.kerberos.delegation.token.signer.secret.provider.zookeper.path \tString \t(chrooted path) + /token \tZookeeper location where secret provider information is stored\nsolr.kerberos.delegation.token.secret.manager.znode.working.path \tString \t(chrooted path) + /zkdtsm \tZookeeper location where token information is stored \n\nDoes it make more sense if we move all znodes related to security under a nested znode like /security/*, i.e. modify the defaults here to /security/zkdtsm and /security/token? It might be easier for sysadmins to know what purpose these znodes are present for.\n\tI liked the idea of Solr protecting these znodes right away through ZK ACLs; it would prevent against vulnerabilities for setups where the sysadmin has forgotten to turn it on for the right znodes. However, should we make that behaviour configurable and make it possible for the sysadmin to not ACL protect those znodes, and allow him to do so manually? The usecase I have in mind, and I'm not sure if this is a real world usecase or not, is where a sysadmin is dealing with a failed ZK setup, and is cloning all the znodes into a fresh ZK cluster: I imagine that such a clone would not work for those two znodes if Solr has ACL protected them.\n\n ",

It seems to me that they do not, as of this patch, even if the user calls use delegation tokens. \n\nAlso, it is my belief that end to end requests work fine, even when internode requests are involved. However there are no tests for this, afaict; neither for kerberos plugin with delegation tokens, nor with delegation tokens. The former situation couldn't be tested at the time of writing the kerberos plugin due to lack of ticket cache of minikdc, but maybe that limitation doesn't stop us from writing tests for the latter. So, even if we don't write such tests here in this issue, I think we should write some as a follow up issue, so that we are alerted when such support breaks.\n\nOverall, I am okay with us committing the current patch.

I would ideally do that here (unless there are some reasons for not doing it that I'm missing completely), however we can as well do that as a follow up issue, if you think that is a better approach.\n\nMany thanks for your excellent work on this issue, we needed this for Solr for long!

Here's a proposed wording (based on the original description in this issue):\n\n\nDelegation tokens\n-----------------\n\nThe Kerberos plugin can, optionally, be configured to use delegation tokens. The plugin allows authenticated users the ability to grab, renew or delete a token that can be used to bypass the normal authentication path for a time. This is useful in a variety of use cases:\n1) distributed clients (e.g. MapReduce) where each client may not have access to the user's Kerberos credentials. Instead, the job runner can grab a delegation token and use that during task execution.\n2) If the load on the Kerberos server is too high, delegation tokens can avoid hitting the Kerberos server after the first request.\n3) If requests/permissions need to be delegated to another user: the more privileged user can request a delegation token that can be passed to the less privileged user.\n\nEnabling delegation tokens can be done by setting the solr.kerberos.delegation.token.enabled parameter to true.

I don't see what's different with this patch than before it.\n\nInternode calls use PKI authentication for any plugin that does not implement HttpClientInterceptorPlugin. Kerberos plugin uses that \"interceptor\" and hence deals with its own internode communication (each node has a client principal associated with it, specified in a jaas config file, for making internode calls). I think the committed patch here for delegation tokens does not have the internode communications using the delegation tokens. If that is the case, we can open another issue to add a test and fix. ",
