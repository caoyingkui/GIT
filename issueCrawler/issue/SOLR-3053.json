    "description": "Sometimes when debugging, it would be nice if we could get stats about what is actually in the Solr cache, or at least the size of some of the bigger items.  For instance, on the filterCache, it is nice to know what the size of the DocSets are.  This can be helpful for debugging heap related issues.\n\nThe proposed way of doing this is to make a config option that, when set to true, spits out appropriate information.  It's not totally clear what the best way to implement this is to be generic for the objects in the cache, but I have some code now that does this when the value in the cache is a DocSet, which is the primary thing I happen to care about at the moment.  I'm open to suggestions and could also be talked out of this all together.",
