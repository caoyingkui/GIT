    "description": "Hi Guys,\n\nI don't know if its really a bug but I think its quite good place for it.\n\nThe problem is with dataImportHandler and DB queries.\n\nFor example:\nLet's have a big table which keeps docs to being indexed, we are running query against it on a datimporthandler and query locks table which is quite obvius and desire behaviour from the SQL points of view but while optimisation is being done its should not allow to issue query because in that case table is being locked till optimisation process will finish which can take a time...\n\nAs a workaround you can use \"select SQL_BUFFER_RESULT...\" statment which will move everything into temp table and release all locks but still dataImportHandlerwill be waiting for optimisation to finish. Which means you will be able to insert new docs into main table at least.\n\n\ncheers",
