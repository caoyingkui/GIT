    "description": "Often you want the dynamic teaser to be about the same visual size for each article in the result list. Google's web search for instance will display 2 lines of teaser, whether there are one or three snippets.\n\nIn Solr you can control hl.snippets and hl.fragSize, but not the resulting total size. If you have three snippets matching, the teaser will be three times as big as for documents with one snippet matching.\n\nI propose a parameter hl.targetSize as an alternative to hl.fragsize, which controls the total number of characters to output in the teaser. So instead of saying &hl.snippets=3&hl.fragSize=100 giving teasers sized between 100-300 characters, you would say &hl.snippets=3&hl.targetSize=300 effectively resulting in the same output as long as there are three snippets, but if there is only one, its fragSize would be adjusted to 300.",
