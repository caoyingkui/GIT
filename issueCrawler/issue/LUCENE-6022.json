    "description": "When live documents are not null, DocValuesDocIdSet checks if doc values match the document before the live docs. Given that checking if doc values match could involve a heavy computation (eg. geo distance) and that the default codec has live docs in memory but doc values on disk, I think it makes more sense to check live docs first?",

Despite its name and what it's javadocs claim, it doesn't appear to have anything to do with DocValues, even if some DocValues code might in turn use it.  It looks remarkably like FilteredDocIdSet but instead of wrapping another DocIdSet, it wraps a Bits.  I've seem somewhat similar classes actually.  I propose that it be renamed to not have DocValues in its name.  But to what?  BitsFilteredDocIdSet is already taken.  It needn't have Bits in the name; that could be just a feature (optional Bits filter).\ngotta go now... ",

The only additional thing it has is the optimization when deleted docs are a bit set but I'm wondering if it really helps in practice given that we try to merge more agressively segments that have lots of deleted documents.
