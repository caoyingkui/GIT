    "description": "Currently individual codec components can override/optimize merging, e.g. the stored fields impl\nuses bulk copying when possible, and so on.\n\nSegmentMerger contains the logic for merging the different codec components, for example it does\nmergeFieldInfos(), then mergeFields(), mergeTerms(), and so on. Each of these methods interacts\nwith the codec apis to finish the merge.\n\nI think it would be cleaner if SegmentMerger called a new method, Codec.merge(), which contained\nthis logic instead. This way someone could customize this process. I think we could probably even \npush some of the impl-dependent stuff (like matchingSegmentReaders) into the impl and out of SegmentMerger.\n\nSetting this for 4.1, I think it would be a nice cleanup but I don't plan on working on this immediately, \nand I think we can do this in a backwards compatible way in a minor release.",
