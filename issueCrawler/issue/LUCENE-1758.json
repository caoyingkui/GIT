    "description": "Someone mentioned on the java user list that the arabic analysis was not as good as they would like.\n\nThis patch adds the \u0644\u0644- prefix (light10 algorithm versus light8 algorithm).\nIn the light10 paper, this improves precision from .390 to .413\nThey mention this is not statistically significant, but it makes linguistic sense and at least has been shown not to hurt.\n\nIn the future, I hope openrelevance will allow us to try some more approaches.",
