    "description": "I have a custom authentication filter sitting in front of the SolrDispatchFilter that writes to ZooKeeper via Curator.  Curator has slightly different definitions for ACLProvider and Credentials than the Solr equivalents of ZkACLProvider and ZkCredentialsProvider.  I'd like to just write a wrapper to use the existing Solr definitions, but have hit a couple of scoping issues:\n\n\tThe ZkCredentialsProvider getScheme and getAuth functions are at package private scope, so I can't convert them to Curator equivalents\n\tThe code to read the solr.xml (in order to get the config) is private to the SolrDispatchFilter, and my filter doesn't have access to the SolrDispatchFilter (so that code needs to be static as well).",
