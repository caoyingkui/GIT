    "description": "In LUCENE-6919 (Lucene 5.5), ScoringWrapperSpans was modified in such a way that made the existence of this class pointless, and possibly broke anyone who was using it as it's SimScorer argument isn't used anymore.  We should now delete it.  SpanWeight has getSimScorer() so people can customize the SimScorer that way.\n\nAnother small change I observe to improve is have SpanWeight.buildSimWeight's last line use the existing Similarity that has already been populated on the field?",

In the attached patch I remove this useless class as well as remove uses of it.  Tests pass.\n\nSince it does nothing (which is itself misleading if anyone actually is using it) and it seems obscure, I propose not keeping it with deprecation in 6x.\n\nProposed message:\n\nIn API Changes: \n\n\tScoringWrapperSpans was removed since it has no purpose or effect as of Lucene 5.5.\n\n\n\nIn other:\n\n\tLUCENE-7384: Removed ScoringWrapperSpans. And tweaked SpanWeight.buildSimWeight to reuse the existing similarity instead of creating a new one. (David Smiley)\n\n "

Now that SpanScorer and Spans are separate again, and SpanScorer holds the similarity objects, we don't need to deal with this any more. "
