    "description": "We have developed several tools and scripts for converting the Ref Guide out of Confluence which get us most of the way to a fully converted set of pages. However, we already know that there are several issues that could not be automated.\n\nFrom https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc/issues/27, we have this list:\n\n\n\tThe conversion process will insert TODOs for several items that we thought might be problematic during conversion; these need to be reviewed and resolved. Some of these items are also covered in the below topics.\n\tBlock elements in tables. The current version of the PDF creation tool we are using does not handle those properly (see https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc/issues/13). In some cases, we should remove the table entirely and present the content in a new way (using, most often, labled lists instead).\n\tReview and (usually) remove huge Tables of Contents from the top of pages. The current design of the online version will automatically create a TOC for the page, we don't need another one and in some cases this TOC was hand-created so can't be removed via conversion.\n\tNon-image attachments. Some SVG files will be converted to images, but they should not be treated as images.\n\tFailed link conversions. Despite my best attempts, many dummy URLs are treated by Confluence as real URLs (meaning, dummy URLs like http://<host>:<port>/solr are coded in Confluence's XHTML with <a> tags). These will be converted as URLs but will throw errors during the conversion process. In some cases, the URLs aren't just these example URLs but are indicative of a real problem that needs to be resolved.\n\tSpurious <br/> tags. Some API pages have a list of available calls structured as a list but without being a real ordered or unordered list. These will convert badly. The issue https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc/issues/31 has a list of pages where this might be a problem.\n\tAppropriate Lead Paragraphs. The stylesheet for HTML pages will make the first paragraph of every HTML page a slightly larger font, by way of introduction. In many cases, the first paragraph is not really ready for that sort of treatment and should be revised to be a more succinct introduction to the feature or further contents of the page.\n\n\n\nMore problems may be added to this issue as items that specifically need to be cleaned up.",

            "content": "One thing about this is that Confluence will need to be locked against any editing after we do an export and start conversion/cleanup (We can convert 100 times with no issues, it's the effort into the post-conversion cleanup that we don't want to waste). This can be easily achieved with permissions, by denying everyone edit access but only read/comment access. (Maybe, actually, \"everyone - 1\" so someone can still get in there if necessary.) ",

            "content": "To add to the list, so I don't forget. There are 2 pages in Confluence that use the excerpt macro and 3 places that use the excerpt-include macro to pull in the section from one of the other pages. The fact that these contain shared content is lost during the conversion.\n\nThe pages are:\n\n\n\thttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Collection-Specific+Tools (collection-specific-tools.adoc) has an excerpt that is pulled into https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Core-Specific+Tools (core-specific-tools.adoc) and https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Using+the+Solr+Administration+User+Interface (using-the-solr-administration-user-interface.adoc)\n\t\n\t\tThese pages have an additional problem, which is that the content is mostly links to other pages, and during conversion those are turned into hard-coded links back to Confluence. This might actually be coming from the export from Confluence, but it really doesn't matter where it comes from, they'll need to be fixed.\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Field+Type+Definitions+and+Properties (field-type-definitions-and-properties.adoc) has an excerpt that is pulled into https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Defining+Fields (defining-fields.adoc)\n\n\n\nThere are a couple options for resolution IMO:\n\n\n\tIgnore the problem for now. Content is duplicated across pages, but these two cases aren't really that onerous.\n\tStart an \"inclusion library\" of small bits of content that isn't a standalone page, but is designed to be pulled into other pages when they are built as HTML and PDF. I want to start doing this eventually, but hoped to avoid it until we got everything all set up and stabilized.\n\n\n\nThe right solution might be a mix of both - ignore it for now, and hopefully soon introduce the inclusion library in a more thoughtful way.
