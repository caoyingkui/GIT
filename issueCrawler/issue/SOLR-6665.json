            "content": "Fix and test to demonstrate the bug.\n\nSince the current code uses a core name and doesn't check for the node name in the verification phase, it can easily be fooled if a replica with the same core name existed on a different node. The test asserts that this method times out. It makes the test always take at least 60s (the timeout value for the method) but I can't find a better way. ",
