    "description": "Hi , \n\nMy requirement is to fetch results like below sql query:\n\nSelect  txn_code,\n\t\ttxn_server,\n\t\tmax(total_time), \n\t\tmin(total_time),\n\t\tmax(db_time), \n\t\tmin(db_time),\nfrom txn_table\ngroup by txn_code,txn_server.\n\n\n\tstatsComponent helps to get  aggregate results & stats.facet is available for single field , but my requirement is to have multi level facet on more than 1 field while fetching results.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know , how to get this using solr , do we have this planned in any upcoming release, or any patch is available ?\n\nThanks & Regards,\nSumit.",
