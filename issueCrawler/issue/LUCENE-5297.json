            "content": "Patch extends RangeFacetRequest to take also a ValueSource and represents the NDV case as LongFieldSource. Also modified RangeAccumulator to use FunctionValues instead of NDV. All TestRangeAccumulator tests pass.\n\nI have nocommits around jdocs, will handle them later. More important is whether this approach is OK, or is it better to separate the accumulator to an NDV one and ValueSource one (I think not, but perhaps others think differently). ",
