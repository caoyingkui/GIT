    "description": "While implementing points support for the terms component in a streaming manner (via PushWriter/MapWriter) I discovered that the XML response writer does not implement this interface.\n\nThis means that any code using PushWriter (via MapWriter or IteratorWriter) will be broken if one tries to use XML response format.  This may easily go unnoticed if one is not using XML response format in testing (JSON or binary is frequently used).",
