    "description": "I think we should consider collapsing multiple nodeAdded / nodeLost events, ie. generate a single event with information about multiple node names, if there were multiple changes to the cluster in a short time.\n\nProcessing a single event that records N changes could help us to react faster to cluster changes than processing N events each with a single change, and with waitFor in between.",

Consequently, the \"nodeName\" event property has been renamed to \"nodeNames\" and its value is a List<String> of node names.\n\nAll tests are passing with these changes. ",
