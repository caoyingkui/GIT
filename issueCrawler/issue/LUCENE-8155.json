            "content": "Here is the patch that basically restores in smokeTester and the main build.xml file before we moved to Java 8 (with Lucene 6). I ran it locally, so it basically works (I did not wait for Solr tests to fail...). I will comit this in a moment to master and branch_7x and enable the Jenkins support.\n\nIn the future I'd propose to keep the code in smoketester the ability to have multiple Java versions (I will add this to the upgrade issue LUCENE-8154, so it is kept alive). It was a pain to add it back. In general it might also be better to remove \"java8\" and \"java9\" from the naming inside the build.xml and smoke tester. E.g. call it JAVA_HOME and the other onve ALT_JAVA_HOME and \"altJavaVersion\".\n\nMichael McCandless: Can you help with cleaing up Smoker and the build script to make it \"more generic\"? ",
