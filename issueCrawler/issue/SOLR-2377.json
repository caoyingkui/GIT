    "description": "In SOLR-1577, Yonik implemented functionality so that an \"empty\" <dataDir/> directive would be treated the same as no dataDir declaration at all (ie: using \"data\" in the instanceDir) so that people could have a sensible default but still use a system property to override using: \n\n<dataDir>${solr.data.dir:}</dataDir>\n\n\nhowever we still have this bad meme in a lot of test configs: \n\n<dataDir>${solr.data.dir:./solr/data}</dataDir>\n\n\nwe should clean that up (if for no other reason then that it sets a really bad example and doesn't help with testing anything)",
