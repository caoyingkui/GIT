    "description": "As put eloquently by Otis on SOLR-5749:\n\n\nIt'd probably be hard for someone to monitor it with jmx because the mbeans will be published only on the overseer node (which can change from time to time).\n\nI think good monitoring tools won't have a problem with that.  But if you expose it through a non-standard API, then it's harder for monitoring tools to get to this info because now they need to implement a mechanism to, in addition to getting data from JMX, also get this other stats from an alternative API with a custom response format.... which makes things messy.",
