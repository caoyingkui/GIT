    "description": "Weight.scorer states that if topScorer == true, Scorer.collect will be called and that otherwise Scorer.nextDoc/advance will be called.\n\nThis is a problem when ConstantScoreQuery is used on top of a QueryWrapperFilter:\n 1. ConstantScoreWeight  calls getDocIdSet on the filter to know which documents to collect.\n 2. QueryWrapperFilter.getDocIdSet returns a Scorer created with topScorer == false so that nextDoc/advance are supported.\n 3. But then ConstantScorer.score(Collector) has the following optimization:\n\n    // this optimization allows out of order scoring as top scorer!\n    @Override\n    public void score(Collector collector) throws IOException {\n      if (docIdSetIterator instanceof Scorer) {\n        ((Scorer) docIdSetIterator).score(wrapCollector(collector));\n      } else {\n        super.score(collector);\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\nSo the filter iterator is a scorer which was created with topScorer = false but ParentScorer ends up using its score(Collector) method, which is illegal. (I found this out because AssertingSearcher has some checks to make sure Scorers are used accordingly to the value of topScorer.)\n\nI can imagine several fixes, including:\n\n\tremoving this optimization when working on top of a filter\n\trelaxing Weight documentation to allow for using score(Collector) when topScorer == false\n\n\n\nbut I'm not sure which one is the best one. What do you think?",

            "content": "Hi Adrien,\nThis is actually my fault. The following fix would be most correct and makes the optimization still work for the not really useful combination: ConstsntScoreQuery(QueryWrapperFilter(Query))\n\nLotS of old code is using this, instead it should directly wrap the Query instead of creating a filter wrap.\n\nI would fix:\n\n\tchange the instanceof check to a query != null and assert that it is a Scorer\n\tadd another special case in rewrite to prevent the old style stupidity: rewrite the above combination to a simple ConstantScoreQuery with the Query that was wrapped by the filter, ignoring inner boost.\n\n\n\nIl'll upoad patch later.
