It also saves the\npointer as delta vs current position, if that would take fewer bytes.\nThe bytes are then in \"forward\" order.\n\nThe size savings varies by FST... eg, for the all-Wikipedia-terms FSA\n(no outputs) it reduces byte size by 21%.  If I map to ords (FST) then\nit's only 13% (I don't do anything to pack the outputs now, so the\nbytes required for them are unchanged).\n\nWhile the resulting FST is smaller, there is some hit to lookup (~8%\nfor the Wikipedia ord FST), because we have to deref some nodes.\n\nI only turned packing on for one thing: the Kuromoji FST (shrank by\n14%, 272 KB).

Thanks for clarification, it seems that there was background information (maybe only discussed in IRC) missing.\n\nAbout the Kumoroji: In my opinion, the JAR size is not the major thing. The reason why Robert and me was compacting structures was to a) reduce SVN checkout size (this should improve by packing) b) reduce memory footprint of the Analyzer (and that is also improvement). As the FST is only build once during rebuilding the binary FST from the dict and not at runtime, should we not package for memory efficiency? ",

You can compare this design in Morfologik:\n\nWell... it's tricky.  First, I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data, eg inCount, newAddress, etc.  That required making the first pass FST \"modal\" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<Int,X>) I think?\n\nSecond, the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading, ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.\n\nBut I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack), and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...\n\nOne thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading, and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord, write-non-ord, read-packed, read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).\n ",

I have a different design in which the FSA is an abstract superclass and the implementation provides methods to walk the edges/ nodes. The writers simply walk that structure when serializing.
