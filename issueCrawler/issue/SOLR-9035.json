The Upgrading Solr page is really a release notes kind of page, but the only page we have about upgrading is https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Upgrading+a+Solr+Cluster. \n\nMy current thinking is that I will move it to be a child of the Upgrading a Solr Cluster page, and hopefully soon we will be able to make a dedicated Upgrade section that fills some of the additional gaps around this topic.
