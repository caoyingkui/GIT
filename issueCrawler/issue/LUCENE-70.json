It returns no hits.\n\nThe query \"Some-Term:value\" appears to be parsed as \"Some-Term:value\" (according\nto Query.toString()) but returns no hits.",

The image, however, still contains the escaping character that needs to \nbe filtered out.\n\nI attach a proposed patch, that will however generate one extra string.\n\nKR,\n\nJean-Francois Halleux ",
