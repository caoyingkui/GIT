Soft deletes are accounted for inside the index writer and therefor also by merge policies.\n\nThis change also adds a SoftDeletesRetentionMergePolicy that allows users to selectively carry over soft_deleted document across merges for retention policies. The merge policy selects documents that should be kept around in the merged segment based on a user provided query.",

            "content": "I think the overall idea is interesting. So the user's \"api\" is to just indicate a field name to indexwriter to be used for soft deletes, similar to using an active=Y/N field for a relational database or whatever. I think thats intuitive.\n\nThe main thing confusing me is the exact docs around that:\n\n\nReturns the field that should be used to find soft deletes. If soft deletes are used all documents that have a doc values value in this field are treated as deleted. The default is null.\n\nCan we expand the doc on this to explain it a bit more for a typical use-case? e.g.:\n\n\thow to soft-delete a doc (fairly obvious)\n\thow to undelete (this part is not obvious to me at the moment)\n\thow to configure a reasonable merge policy, say with a 7-day retention of soft deletes or some other reasonable example (there is a test for this case, but its trying to really exercise the merge policy and difficult as an example)\n\n\n ",
