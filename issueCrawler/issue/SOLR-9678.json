    "description": "Right now in 6.1.2 there doesn't seem to be a way to sort documents by numFound when grouped by a field. We're looking for this feature and can't implement it since numFound isn't a valid field. We've looked for alternatives but haven't found any. Please include this feature in the next release or direct us towards an alternative.",
