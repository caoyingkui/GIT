    "description": "When running Solr in cloud mode, the UI has a 'Replication' tab under 'Core Selector' . \n\nI think we should not display this when Solr is running in cloud mode. It doesn't add any value as this is useful for master-slave setups. It could also be harmful if someone accidentally clicks on 'Disable Replication' in the UI.",
