    "description": "I have a Text field (call it \"text\") and a Keyword field (call it \"keyword\"). I'd like to be able to do the following search:\n\ntext:\"some text\" AND keyword:\"http://somekeyword\"\n\nto find documents where the text contains \"some\" and \"text\" and the keyword is \"http://somekeyword\"\n\nI want the text part of the query to use the StandardAnalyzer and the keyword portion to use a trivial analyzer that just passes the text string through. In the above case, Lucene uses the QueryParser's analyzer (I used StandardAnalyzer) to parse \"http://somekeyword\" into \"http\" and \"somekeyword\", which is not what I want.",
