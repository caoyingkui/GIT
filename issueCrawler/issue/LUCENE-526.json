    "description": "From my own post to the java-user list. I have looked into this further and am sure it's a bug.\n\n\u2014\n\nIt seems to me that there's a possible bug in FieldSortedHitQueue, specifically in getCachedComparator(). This is showing up on our 1.4.3 install, but it seems from source code inspection that if it's a bug, it's in 1.9.1 also.\n\nThe issue shows up when you need to sort results from a given IndexReader multiple times, using different locales. On line 180 (all line numbers from the 1.9.1 code), we have this:\n\nScoreDocComparator comparator = lookup (reader, fieldname, type, factory);\n\nThen, if no comparator is found in the cache, a new one is created (line 193) and then stored in the cache (line 202). HOWEVER, both the cache lookup() and store() do NOT take into account locale; if we, on the same index reader, try to do one search sorted by Locale.FRENCH and one by Locale.ITALIAN, the first one will result in a cache miss, a new French comparator will be created, and stored in the cache. Second time through, lookup() finds the cached French comparator \u2013 even though this time, the locale parameter to getCachedComparator() is an Italian locale. Therefore, we don't create a new comparator and we use the wrong one to sort the results.\n\nIt looks to me (unless I'm mistaken) that the FieldCacheImpl.Entry class should have an additional property, .locale, to ensure that different locales get different comparators.\n\n\u2014\n\nPatch (well, most of one) to follow immediately.",

This means that ONLY the FieldSortedHitQueue is locale-aware; the FieldCache itself isn't (there are no locales used in the interface). I thought I would provide this \"prototype\" patch, though, as an example. I am open to suggestions about how best to implement this. Options include\n\n\tsubclass FieldCacheImpl.Entry into a locale-aware version, which FieldSortedHitQueue uses\n\tchange the FieldCache interface to take in a locale for the various getXxxx methods (or possibly only the String ones?)\n\tsomething else I haven't thought of...?\n\n\n\nI look forward to your thoughts.

Even after LUCENE-526-b is applied, and hence the first new test passes, the second fails.\n\nThe second test takes the existing IndexSearcher, wraps it up as the only Searcher in a MultiSearcher, and then searches the MultiSearcher. It seems that the results come out of the IndexSearcher in the right order, but when MultiSearcher merges the results from all of its Searchers (in this case, just one) the local-specific sorting isn't done correctly.\n\nI will investigate further today, with a patch hopefully to follow.

The comparators[] array is correct, so FieldSortedHitQueue sorts fine, but the topdocs that come out of the search have no locale in the fields[]; therefore, the in-order insertion in MultiSearcher screws up the order as it now no longer knows what locale to use.\n\nTest case from LUCENE-526-c.txt now passes.
