    "description": "Some small changes:\n\n\n\tAllow specifying a priority for BG threads, after the \"&\"\n    character; priority increment is + or - int that's added to main\n    thread's priority to set child thread's.  For my NRT tests I make\n    the reopen thread +2, the indexing threads +1, and leave searching\n    threads at their default.\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded test case\n\n\n\n\n\tNearRealTimeReopenTask now reports @ the end the full array of\n    msec of each reopen latency\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded optional breakout of counts by time steps.  If you set\n    log.time.step.msec to eg 1000 then reported counts for serial task\n    sequence is broken out by 1 second windows.  EG you can use this\n    to measure slowdown over time.",
