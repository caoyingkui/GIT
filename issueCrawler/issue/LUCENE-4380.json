    "description": "spinoff from LUCENE-4371:\n\nCurrently NIOFSDirectory.NIOFSIndexInput extends SimpleFSDirectory.SimpleFSIndexInput, but this isn't an is-a relationship at all.\n\nAdditionally SimpleFSDirectory has a funky Descriptor class that extends RandomAccessFile that is useless:\n\n    /**\n     * Extension of RandomAccessFile that tracks if the file is \n     * open.\n     */\n...\n      // remember if the file is open, so that we don't try to close it\n      // more than once\n\n\n\nRandomAccessFile is closeable, this is not necessary and I don't think we should be subclassing it.",
