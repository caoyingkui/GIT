    "description": "Currently the abstract DirectoryReader and MultiReader and ParallelCompositeReader extend a package private class. Users that want to implement a composite reader, should be able to subclass this pkg-private class, as it implements lots of abstract methods, useful for own implementations. In fact MultiReader is a shallow subclass only implementing correct closing&refCounting.\n\nBy making it public after the rename, the generics problems (type parameter R is not correctly displayed) in the JavaDocs are solved, too.",
