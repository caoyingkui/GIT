    "description": "Lucene/Solr project depends on number of third party libraries. Some of those libraries contain security vulnerabilities. Upgrading to versions of those libraries that have fixes for those vulnerabilities is a simple, critical step we can take to improve the security of the system. But for that we need a tool which can scan the Lucene/Solr dependencies and look up the security database for known vulnerabilities.\n\nI found that OWASP dependency-checker can be used for this purpose. It provides a ant task which we can include in the Lucene/Solr build. We also need to figure out how (and when) to invoke this dependency-checker. But this can be figured out once we complete the first step of integrating this tool with the Lucene/Solr build system.",
