    "description": "I am using apache wicket and apache solr.\nIn wicket i am passing QueryResponse to several classes which worked fine\nuntil I started using SpellChecking.\nWicket is serializing objects in order to store them between requests.\nQueryResponse implements Serializable but SpellCheckResponse which is a\nmember field of QueryResponse does not. This leads to Exceptions.\n\nMy question is:\n\nIs there a good reason for SpellCheckResponse (and TermsResponse) not to\nimplement Serializable? If used, both fields breake the serialisation of QueryResponse.",
