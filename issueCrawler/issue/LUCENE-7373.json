    "description": "Today, when you call FSDirectory.renameFile it also calls fsync on\nthe directory.\n\nThis is OK for Lucene's current usage of this method, to rename just\nthe one segments_N file on commit.\n\nBut in playing with adding NRT replication (LUCENE-5438) to the simple\ndemo Lucene server (LUCENE-5376) I found that, on spinning disks, that\nfsync is very costly, because when copying over an NRT point, we write\nto N .tmp files and then rename many files (taking seconds) in the\nend.\n\nI think we should just deprecate/remove the existing method, and make a new\nrename method that does only renaming, and a separate\nsyncMetaData to call fsync on the directory?",
