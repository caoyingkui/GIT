            "content": "How is it broken?\n\nThere are a few issues...\n\nThe most basic is that LazyPluginHolder uses the \"inst\" member directly in createInst().\nThis means that even without considering complex reordering and memory barrier issues, the code is incorrect.  It publishes the object as soon as it is created.  Another thread coming along can thus use that object before initInstance() has been called, or even during the execution of initInstance().\n\nBut when we do take the java memory model into account, we need to publish objects safely (i.e. avoid the classic trap behind double-checked locking)\nhttp://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html\n\nDepending on how close() is called (i.e. the possible contexts of it's use), there's a race where one thread may be constructing an object and another thread goes through and closes everything, missing the object under construction that will then presumably never have close() called on it.  This last one may not actually be an issue if it's never called concurrently with other methods. ",
