    "description": "Currently replication always happens via the (one) url present in the cluster state. This new feature is to support replication via alternative network interfaces if corresponding (optional) details are present in the cluster state (and the configured RecoveryStrategy chooses to use the alternatives).\n\nA motivation for use of an alternative network interface could be the separation of replication versus regular live within-cloud traffic.",
