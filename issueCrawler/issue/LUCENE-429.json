    "description": "The SimpleHTMLEncoder could be improved slightly: all characters with code >=\n128 should be encoded as character entities. The reason is, that the encoder\ndoes not know the encoding that is used for the response. Therefore it is safer\nto encode all characters beyond ASCII as character entities.\n\nHere is the necessary modification of SimpleHTMLEncoder:\n\n       default:\n         if (c < 128) \n{\n           result.append(c);\n         }\n else \n{\n           result.append(\"&#\").append((int)c).append(\";\");\n         }",
