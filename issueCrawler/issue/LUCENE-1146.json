    "description": "ConjunctionScorer initialization is done lazy in next() and skipTo() methods, using one if(firstTime) check, this patch moves this initialization to the Constructor. Constructor already throws an IOException.  speed-up on jdk 5 & 6  is in the 3.5% - 4% range. Speed-up was measured with standard TestScorerPerf test in Lucene test package (very dense bit sets) .\n\nSimilar issue is  with: \nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1145?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel\n\npatch made on trunk revision:  614219",
