    "description": "We improved on our 'random document generation' a lot in LUCENE-3911\n\nIn fact these random docs find a lot of real bugs. Also the linedocs\ndriven from real data is also improved in the analyzer tests: it takes\nsubstrings of random linedocs and makes 'partial docs'.\n\nReally we should refactor this so that LineDocs uses a mix of real,\npartial-real, and synthetic docs just like the analyzer tests.\n\nThis would help tests like term dictionary tests which are basically\nstatic (even though they are random, the amount of documents is limited).\n\nBaseTokenStreamTestCase would simply pull from LineDocs at that point,\nbut other tests would immediately see the benefits.",
