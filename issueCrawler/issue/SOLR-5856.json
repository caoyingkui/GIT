            "content": "Hi Alexandre,\n\nI agree with you. It looks like there are two Solr 3.x books, and the older one has already been previously \"cut\" from the rotating slideshow. At this point, I think the other 3.x book is going to have to be bumped. The good news is that those authors are working on a 4.x refresh that should be released in a few months, so they'll likely be back up there soon.\n\nOf course, all of the books are still on the books page, just not in the \"Latest books published about Apache Solr\" list in the header slideshow.\n\nThe patch I included makes bumps the 3x book and inserts Solr in Action.

I, for one, would be happy to have at Solr's content Google Analytics analysis (if given access) and see what we can tell from it. "

One of the books already did this, but it was missing on the others, and this is one of the things visitors are probably most likely to click on to try to get the book. "
