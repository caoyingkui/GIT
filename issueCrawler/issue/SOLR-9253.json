On the surface this appears to be a usage question.\n\nWhen you do ping the user's list you need to be much more specific. What fails? You say \"SolrCloud goes down\". Crashes? If so what's in the error log? Locks up? Hits an OOM error? The relevant parts of the solr log file are important for those questions. \n\nWhat do you mean \"switch to SolrCloud\"? Exactly how are you doing that switch?\n ",

It looks like you have increased http connection defaults only for the SolrJ client. This is not enough. You need to increase these defaults inside Solr (in solr.xml) so that the inter-node communication is not blocked.\n\nI agree with Erick that this is not a bug but a usage problem. It is better that you raise such issues on the solr-user mailing list first and open a Jira issue only when there is an indication of a bug in Solr. Please discuss this issue further on the mailing list. ",
