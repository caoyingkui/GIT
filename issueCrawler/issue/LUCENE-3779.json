    "description": "The fix revision 219387 (Fix for NPE (bug #35626). Fix by Hans Hjelm, test case by Scotty Allen.) was aimed to remove an NPE bug on the  return value of  \"_termPositionsQueue.peek()\" in the method \"skipTo\" of the file \"/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/MultipleTermPositions.java\" , but it is incomplete. \nSince the returned value  \"_termPositionsQueue.peek()\" could be null during the run-time execution, its value should also be null-checked before being dereferenced in other methods. \n\nThe buggy code locations the same fix needs to be applied at are as bellows: \n\nLine 118, 124, 135 of the method \"next()\" : \n\npublic final boolean next() throws IOException {\n    if (_termPositionsQueue.size() == 0)\n      return false;\n\n    _posList.clear();\n[Line  118]    _doc = _termPositionsQueue.peek().doc();\n\n    TermPositions tp;\n    do {\n      tp = _termPositionsQueue.peek();\n\n[Line  124]        for (int i = 0; i < tp.freq(); i++) \n{\n          // NOTE: this can result in dup positions being added!\n        _posList.add(tp.nextPosition());\n        }\n\n      if (tp.next())\n        _termPositionsQueue.updateTop();\n      else \n{\n        _termPositionsQueue.pop();\n        tp.close();\n      }\n[Line  135]    } while (_termPositionsQueue.size() > 0 && _termPositionsQueue.peek().doc() == _doc);\n\n    _posList.sort();\n    _freq = _posList.size();\n\n    return true;\n\n  }",
