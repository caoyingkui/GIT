    "description": "RAMDirectory uses RAMFiles to store the data. RAMFile offers a newBuffer() method for extensions to override and allocate buffers differently, from e.g. a pool or something. However, RAMDirectory always allocates RAMFile and doesn't allow allocating a RAMFile extension, which makes RAMFile.newBuffer() unusable.\n\nI think we can simply introduce a newRAMFile() method on RAMDirectory and make the RAMFiles map protected, and it will allow really extending RAMDir.\n\nI will post a patch later.",

I don't mind developing on trunk and merging to 3x if that will improve anything, but would the history of 3x look like then? Perhaps we should avoid merging on a regular basis and instead apply the patch on both, and then once in a while we do a big mergeprops merge? ",

The mergeprops on things like Tokenizer aren't his fault, its because\nsomeone merged incorrectly before.\n\nI just suggest we do the following:\n\n\talways svn update before merging\n\talways merge from top-level svn root (if you merged from some other location, then merge again from top level before committing)\n\n\n\nI cleaned up the mergeprops yesterday so the problems Yonik sees shouldn't happen anymore.\nbut: its important people do proper merging so that we don't end up in this situation.
