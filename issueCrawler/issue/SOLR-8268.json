    "description": "Adds expression support to the Stats stream. With this it will now be possible to express an stats stream as\n\n\nstats(\n  collection1, q=*:*, fl=\"fieldA,fieldB,fieldInt,fieldFloat\",\n  sum(fieldInt), \n  sum(fieldFloat), \n  min(fieldInt), \n  min(fieldFloat), \n  max(fieldInt), \n  max(fieldFloat), \n  avg(fieldInt), \n  avg(fieldFloat), \n  count(*)\n)\n\n\n\nYou can collect stats on any supported metric and use full metric features. Ie, when SOLR-8185 is committed you can then include operations in the metrics.",
