Whenever i tried to fix it before (e.g. removing zips), people complained at me \"what are you trying to fix\" and wouldn't let me minimize it in the slightest.\n\nNow the problem is clear, we have a blocker issue to discuss it.",

Once the javadocs situation is fixed, the size of .tgz vs .zip is essentially the same (see my numbers above). I think thats because, once the javadocs thing is fixed, then zips/tgzs mostly contain already-compressed jars so it does not matter, its just a convenient packaging format. "

I do not care which one it is, but I don't think having both is really helpful for lucene. The third party jars are also very large, so we should discuss that too.\n\nNOTE: I didn't do experiments with solr, its an app so it has more complexities here.

Explaining it going away in 5.1 would be a lot more awkward. It's a clear issue with simple solution (just stop building/bundling). Nothing will break, because nothing relies on those Javadocs. I am already doing Javadocs online with search built-in ( http://www.solr-start.com/javadoc/solr-lucene/index.html ), so we know that the shipped Javadocs are not actually all that good or useful.\n\nBundling as a zip/tgz-only is also easy to do (disable the task), but choosing which one to keep is harder and there might be downstream tasks that rely on a particular format's presence. But that should not hold up the Javadocs issue. So, maybe that should be for 5.1 with a warning/discussion on the dev list outside of JIRA.\n\nOther artifacts would probably take even more discussion. Target that for 5.1 or 5.2. I have absolutely zero opinions on those as I only use Lucene downloads to build the Javadocs. But I strongly agree on making things smaller. I suspect this discussion would also re-trigger the discussion on modularity/plugins. Both in relations to ElasticSearch implementation of plugins and with recent work on Solr towards plugins.

If I am not listening, then why my slides at the Solr Revolutions were bitching about Solr distribution size with charts and all? You think I wasted my precious presentation time on that because it was an easy issue to raise?\n\nThere is a bad joke about Americans in a foreign country just repeating the questions (in English) louder when they are misunderstood. Similarly, I don't think using the same words again but in all caps (or with a blocker flag) is what will make a difference. You are being very explicit about what you want for Lucene. But when people come back and say that they disagree or only comment on a part of an issue, you are repeating exactly the same message just louder. I do not see you addressing different impacts on developers and final users. Impact is not just size, it's historical implications, 3rd party systems, etc. \n\nYou asked for feedback, you got some, including some representing the issues you - as a hardcore developer - don't seem to care much about. You were unhappy that the feedback did not fully agree with your vision, so will now go ahead and do it your way anyway. Why did you bother asking then, apart from Grandstanding? \n\nThe saddest thing is that people are mostly agreeing with you on this issue. Yet, the conversation is rapidly going in the direction where you will either abandon this with bitter complains or push things through in the way that only address your own concerns. "

I don't care about solr here, Someone else can lead the charge for solr honestly, it will not be me. sparks are not going to fly and I am not going to develop any plugin system to deal with its size issue.\n\nSo please, lets just comment on the very specific proposal for lucene here and not discuss anything else irrelevant.

I did a quick survey of other apache projects.  A number I looked at only released with tgz (hadoop, couchdb, cassandra, cordova).  Others I looked at were the main httpd project, which released source as tgz but binary as zip, and Harmony which had both tgz and zip. Flex and Geronimo also released zip and labelled as \"windows\" and tgz and labelled it for mac and linux.  IMO, if someone cannot handle extracting a tgz on windows, they can't handle running Solr.\n\nFor removing dependencies, I'm in favor of this:\nWe can have the build emit information to a .txt or whatever describing exactly which versions we have tested (for people not using a dependency manager to get these artifacts from maven).

If we keep .zip, do we change that aspect of artifact creation?  My bias would be to stick with the *NIX text format, but that will cause problems for less sophisticated Windows users who use the built in Notepad.  Microsoft needs to correctly handle LF-only text files in Notepad.\n\nI don't really care too much about whether the supported archive is .zip or .tgz, but I do care about the text file format.  I never run production on Windows, so I don't want CR in my text files.  That's honestly my primary motivation for preferring tgz. "
