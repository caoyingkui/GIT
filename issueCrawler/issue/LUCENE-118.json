    "description": "I've noticed an oddity in scoring....\n\nIf I do my search like this:\n\nsearcher.search(query, filter, new HitCollector()\n{\n \tpublic void collect(int doc, float score)\n \t{\n \t\ttempHits.add(new LuceneHits(doc, score));\n\t}\n});\n\n\nI get different scores for the resulting documents than I do if I do\nmy search like this:\n\nhits = searcher.search(query, filter);\n\nBoth methods return the same number of hits.  I can live with them\nreturning different scores, I'm just curious as to why it happens.\n\nFurthermore, the first method returns several scores that are greater\nthan 1.0.  Isn't this supposed to be impossible?  The FAQ states that\nscores range from 0 to 1.\n\nI have a self-contained class test class I will attach shortly...\n\nThis affects the 1.3 RC's as well.",

This\nbothers some folks, so Hits hides it, however it's very difficult to efficiently\nhide it from a HitCollector.\n\nIf anything, this is a documentation bug.  Things are working as intended. ",
