This test has really become unreadable / unmaintainable.\n\nI would split it into separate test classes each testing a specific part:\n\n\tA test that both tests the first and second pass collector.\n\tSome as above but then a sharded test.\n\tMove the test for the all groups collector to AllGroupsCollectorTest.\n\tMove out the block grouping to a dedicated test.\n\tI think the usage of CacheCollector can be removed and perhaps this can just be tested via the 'GroupingSearchTest' class.\n\n\n\nThis is a big tasks  So it would be a more digestible task if this is done step by step.
