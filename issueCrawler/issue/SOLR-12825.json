    "description": "Hi,\nI need to secure my SOLR URL (which is http as of now) with https TLS1.2. I followed below link in order to set up ssl\nhttps://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/enabling-ssl.html#enabling-ssl\n\nProblem is-- after following above steps, I can see SOLR is up and running in older browser versions. But latest version of Firefox, IE and Chrome are not recognizing it. Also, https version comes with TLS1.0 only.\n\nCan it be done TLS1.2? Is there any step which I'm missing. Please help. This is urgent. \nThanks",
