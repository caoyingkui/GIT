The Apache Software Foundation does not provide binary packages for specific Linux distributions, it is the responsibility of the package maintainer at the distribution vendor.\n\nIn general, it is in all cases better to install Solr by hand and not use Ubuntu packages, because hose have strange settings and are not as customizeable as needed (and also outdated, as you see). Also the Jetty webserver shipped with Solr is specifically configured and optimized for Solr. We don't provide any specific support or optimized settings for Tomcat, too. ",
