    "description": "Currently we store a global (not per-segment) field number->name mapping in _X.fnx\n\nHowever, it doesn't actually save us any performance e.g on IndexWriter's init because\nsince LUCENE-2984 we are to loading the fieldinfos anyway to compute files() for IFD, etc, \nas thats where hasProx/hasVectors is.\n\nAdditionally in the past global files like shared doc stores have caused us problems,\n(recently we just fixed a bug related to this file in LUCENE-3601).\n\nFinally this is trouble for backwards compatibility as its difficult to handle a global\nfile with the codecs mechanism.",
