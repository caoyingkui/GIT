    "description": "Since SOLR-2438, we can support localized rangequeries if someone has (ICU)CollationKeyFilter in the chain.\n\nI think it might be best to add these automagically, because if you use these filters then not analyzing\nwith them just means stuff doesn't work at all, since the terms are represented as collation keys.\n\nIn trunk this already works, because (ICU)CollationField takes care of it.",

Can be used to ignore punctuation/whitespace.\n\tcaseLevel: 'true' or 'false'. Useful with strength=primary to ignore accents but not case.\n\tcaseFirst: 'lower' or 'upper'. Useful to control which is sorted first when case is not ignored.\n\tnumeric: 'true' or 'false'. Digits are sorted according to numeric value, e.g. foobar-9 sorts before foobar-10\n\tvariableTop: single character or contraction. Controls what is variable for 'alternate'\n\n "
