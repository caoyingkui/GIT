    "description": "The fix revision 407851 was aimed to remove an NPE bug on the  return value of  \"fieldToReader.get(field)\" in the methods \"getTermFreqVector\", \"hasNorms\", \"norms\", \"doSetNorm\" of the file \"/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/ParallelReader.java\n\" , but it is incomplete. \nSince the returned value  \"fieldToReader.get(field)\" could be null during the runtime execution, its value should also be null-checked before being dereferenced in other methods. \n\nThe buggy code locations the same fix needs to be applied at are as bellows: \n\nLine 499  of the method \"ParallelTermEnum()\" : \n\n\npublic ParallelTermEnum() throws IOException {\n      try \n{\n        field = fieldToReader.firstKey();\n      }\n catch(NoSuchElementException e) \n{\n        // No fields, so keep field == null, termEnum == null\n        return;\n      }\n      if (field != null)\n[Line 499]        termEnum = fieldToReader.get(field).terms();\n    }",
