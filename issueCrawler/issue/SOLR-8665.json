    "description": "When configsets are used, the instanceDir for each core is set to the configset directory.  This likely made the feature a lot easier to write, but it causes problems for things like the last index timestamp for the dataimport handler.  Instead of ending up in the parent directory of dataDir, it ends up in the configset directory, which means that all cores using that configset have the same dataimport last index timestamp.\n\nI'm not sure whether there is anything else that might be affected by the shared instanceDir.",
