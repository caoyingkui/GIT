    "description": "Distributed execution of deleteByQuery(\"*:*\") depends on the existence of a field _version_ in the schema. The default schema has no comment on this field to indicate its important or relevance to SolrCloud, and no message is logged nor error status returned when there is no such field. The code in DistributedUpdateProcessor just has an if statement that never ever does any local deleting without it.\n\nI don't know whether the intention was that this should work or not. If someone would clue me in, I'd make a patch for schema.xml to add comments, or a patch to D-U-P to add logging. If it was supposed to work, I'm probably not qualified to make the fix to make it work.",

The main description should be kept as a short problem description only, not involving solution...\n\nAlso, any potential patch should be in SVN diff format from project root and named SOLR-NNNN.patch, i.e. SOLR-3347.patch. JIRA will keep track of which is the newest one. "

However, in this particular case, my initial diagnostic theory was so wildly wrong that I felt it appropriate to either edit the description or close the JIRA and open a new one.\n\nAs for the patch file names, that's just laziness. On the other hand, I'm one of the many people around the ASF making use of the git mirrors, especially when working on code where I'm not a committer \u2013 thus 'git format-patch'. You're the first person around here to express any problem with that. I wonder if there's some trick to get git to make a patch that is indistinguishable from svn diff. "
