    "description": "If offsets go negative or backwards, it can corrupt the index with DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS_AND_OFFSETS: the offsets will have wrong values (different from the term vectors) or even crazy values like -2147483645\n\nThe problem with this is that its not just theoretical: its too easy to do this with lucene's own analyzer chains (e.g. ngramtokenizer).\n\nSee issues such as LUCENE-3920 and some discussion on LUCENE-3738\n\nThe question is how to fix this, e.g. should we:\n\n\tstart enforcing that offsets cannot be crazy values in OffsetAttributeImpl/IndexWriter and fix the broken analyzers\n\tleave offsets as a pair of opaque integers, declaring this a limitation of the current codec, and either workaround or throw UOE from the postings writer.",

I think offsets should be strongly typed (they are the character offsets), \nand we should enforce this so that highlighting actually works.\n\nif people want a place to dump opaque data per-position, they can just use the payload for that.
