    "description": "I was asked a question recently - \"Is using OpenJDK safe with Solr 7.4\" . To which my answer was yes . This was after I checked with Steve on which OpenJDK version runs on his jenkins\n\nFor refrerence it currently uses -\n\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_171\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_171-8u171-b11-1~bpo8+1-b11)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.171-b11, mixed mode)\n\n\u00a0\n\nSolr's ref guide (\u00a0 https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/installing-solr.html#got-java ) mentions using Oracle 1.8 or higher .\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe should mention that both Oracle JDKs and Open JDKs are tested. Perhaps even have a compatibility matrix\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso we should note that Java 9 and 10 are short term releases . Hence remove wording that using Java8+ with more spefic versions.",

Add something like \"You'll want to be sure that the license for the Java version you choose will meet your needs\" ... to be re-worded as necessary so it flows well.  So we draw attention to licensing without an explicit recommendation. ",

            "content": "With the new 6-month release cadence from Oracle people will need to\u00a0upgrade versions every 6 months or alternatively purchase a\u00a0license from Oracle. While Oracle Java and other paid options may be the goto choice for some, I think most users are better off if all our docs and examples uses\u00a0the adoptopenjdk.net\u00a0distribution and links to it.\n\nThe AdoptOpenJDK releases are probably the closes thing to what people are used to from Oracle already, getting security and bug fixes at regular intervals. You will get that 100% open source and free from AdoptOpenJDK. We can of course also mention the other JREs that we regularly run tests for. ",
