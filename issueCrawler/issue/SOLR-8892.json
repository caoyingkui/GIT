    "description": "Discussed this with [~markmiller].  SOLR-8869 allows us to not return field cache entries from the SolrFieldCacheMBean.  It would be nice to be a little more flexible about this; the reason SOLR-8869 was useful was that the field cache printing was expensive due to periodic monitoring calls to /jmx.  But turning off the field cache entry printing via SOLR-8869 also turns it off from the web ui.  It can be useful for users and admins to be able to view the cache entries there, non-periodically, without paying a performance penalty due to /jmx calls.\n\nThe proposal here is to allow SolrInfoMBeans to define statistics to be returned specificially for jmx purposes and to implement a specific instance of this for the SolrFieldCacheMBean.",
