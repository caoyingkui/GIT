In fact it does seem to be the 'right' way to translate the XML output to JSON, it is easy to parse, and it is intuitive.\n\nI've reduced the priority of this issue since there is a workaround, but I would certainly suggest that the default output format be changed to 'map'. Since it is unexpected behaviour I still consider this issue a bug. "
