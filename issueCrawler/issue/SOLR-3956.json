Adjusting the facet.limit to any number greater than 0 returns the facet counts as expected.\n\nThis does not appear limited to a specific field type, as I have tried on (both multivalued and not) text, string, boolean, and double types.",

            "content": "After tracing down the problem with using facet.offset combined with facet.limit<0 i started to rethink the wisdom of changing getFacetEntries to treat negative numbers as \"unlimited\" it seemed more prudent to revise the patch so that the the calling code in Solr passes Integer.MAX_VALUE when facet.limit < 0, and update getFacetEntries to not have int overflow if Integer.MAX_VALUE < offset+limit. (fixing other cases extreme cases beyond just facet.limit < 0)\n\ntests now all pass, but i'm running some more iterations in case i've tripped something in other random tests. "
