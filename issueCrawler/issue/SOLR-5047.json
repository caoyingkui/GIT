    "description": "In the Solr Admin UI, only the leaf (individual core) nodes have colored statuses, leaving collections and shards as no-context nodes. Having status information for collections and shards would improve the ability for an administrator to recognize which collections and shards are influenced by server downtime on certain cores.\n\nWith increasing severity, the current core statuses are: Active, Recovering, Down, Recovery Failed, Gone\n\nThe simplest plan:\n\n\tshards inherit the best status of their cores, one functioning core of that shard implies that the shard is functional\n\tcollections inherit the worst status of their shards, one missing shard implies that the collection is not able to access data\n\n\n\nMore complicated, but accurate, would be appropriate indication of partially failed shards and their influence on the total \"health\" of the collection.",
