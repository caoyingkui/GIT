    "description": "I happily observed that calling CoreContainer#register(name,core,false) allows you to have more than one name for a core, but persisting the multi-core configuration for that setup results in two <core name=\"...\"/> entries in the solr.xml file with the same name.\n\nThe proper thing to do in this situation is probably persist something more like:\n\n\n<core names=\"core1,core2,core3\" />\n\n\nIf that is indeed the intended behavior, I'm happy to provide a patch.",
