    "description": "Core init or recovery never completes if a warmup query fails to complete when timeAllowed is specified as a default parameter in requestHandler settings and the warmup query execution exceeds it. In this case an exception is logged but the recovery never completes. It's of course possible to include another value for timeAllowed in the warmup query, but I believe this could be handled in a more robust manner, such as ignoring timeAllowed for warmup or binging the core online regardless of the timeout.",
