    "description": "Please add \"public\" access-specifier to org.apache.solr.core.AbstractSolrEventListener to allow programmers to subclass this class. \n\nI was able to directly implement SolrEventListener in my own package but I had to dupe the 20 lines of code from AbstractSolrEventListener. \n\nThe current class declaration looks like this: \n\nclass AbstractSolrEventListener implements SolrEventListener \n{...}\n\nI was not able to subclass AbstractSolrEventListener in my own JAR within my own \"org.apache.solr.core\" package because the runtime couldn't instantiate my class. Native code in the JVM throws an IllegalAccessError. I think the reason is that solr.war is signed which causes JDK 1.6 to barf when doing this kind of nasty package-theft.",
