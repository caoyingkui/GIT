    "description": "I was looking at a call to Sort.rewrite() in some code that uses Lucene and it struck me as a little curious.  It appears similar in spirit to Query.rewrite() yet user code never calls Query.rewrite(), Lucene will call that one.  Shouldn't Sort/SortField rewrite() work the same way?  There's nothing to remind you right now to call rewrite(), no javadoc mention even.",
