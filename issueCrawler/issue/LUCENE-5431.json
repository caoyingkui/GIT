    "description": "FSLockFactory doesn't override toString, which causes Dir.toString() to print the class.name@instance. I think it would be better if it printed e.g. the lockDir.\n\nI added it but TestCrashCausesCorruptIndex failed because it declares a Directory which doesn't override getLockID(), which returns toString(). I changed that Directory to extend FilterDirectory, and fixed FilterDirectory to override getLockID() to call in.getLockID().\n\nWill attach a patch shortly.",

I also added TestFilterDirectory to make sure we override all Directory methods (but it allows defining some that we're OK with not overriding), so we don't forget to override important methods like getLockID() in the future.\n\nI think it's ready.
