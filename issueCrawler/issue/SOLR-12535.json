    "description": "In Solr 7 we can't index boost as it's gone from Lucene. The JSON support for this syntax is still allowed but logs a warning and doesn't apply the boost (as it's not supported). I'm proposing we remove support for this altogether. This also means removing an little-known way to specify an \"extended field value\" that doesn't necessarily have a boost.\n With boost: Today logs a warning. Don't want this to work at all.\n\n[{'id':'1', 'val_s':{'value':'foo', 'boost':2.0}}]\n\n\nWithout boost: Today works. Don't want this to work at all, as it complicates support for labelled child documents \u2013 SOLR-12362.\n\n[{'id':'1', 'val_s':{'value':'foo'}}]\n\n\nInternally this is parsed by\n org.apache.solr.handler.loader.JsonLoader.SingleThreadedJsonLoader#parseExtendedFieldValue\n I think we need make no reference to the notion of an \"extended field value\". Either we have a \"partial update\", or we have a \"child document\"; nothing else.\n\nhttps://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_3/updating-parts-of-documents.html\n\nNote: partial updates look similar and have exactly one field-value using a limited set of verbs like \"set\":\n\n[{'id':'1', 'val_s':{'set':'foo'}}]",
