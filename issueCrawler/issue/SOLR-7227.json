    "description": "Currently, there is still the solr.war file in the server/webapps directory, which gets extracted upon first startup of Solr. It would be better to ship Solr with the WAR already extracted, thus taking us one step closer to truly not shipping a WAR file. Moreover, some users have reported not being able to make /opt/solr truly read-only because of the need to extract the WAR on-the-fly upon first startup.",

No more WAR period! \n\nVery good upgrade instructions will be very important\n\nDoing this actually helps with upgrades since you can just install a new version into /opt, e.g. /opt/solr-5.1.0, and then update the symlink /opt/solr -> /opt/solr-5.1.0 ... assuming you're using the suggested production deployment model describe here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Taking+Solr+to+Production ",

I left it in there now, but I think it should go away. And while we're at it, maybe we should rename the server/solr-webapp directory to something non-webapp specific, server/solr-???

We can change those easily enough.  The potential problem is homegrown scripts written by users.  If we move the extracted artifacts, even just one directory level, we risk problems with highly customized user setups.\n\nIs it enough to assume someone who builds their own scripts will be able to use a note in the \"upgrading from\" section of CHANGES.txt to figure out how to fix their setup when they upgrade?  It might be.  User confusion is always a worry for me, because Solr already has plenty to offer in that department.\n\nI can't imagine based on anything you've said that I would want to vote -1.  I offer my thoughts only for consideration.\n\nSemi-related: I need to find out what we've got for documentation on upgrading a Solr 5.x install to the next release.
