    "description": "This is a spinoff from LUCENE-1701.\n\nA user using Numeric* should not need to understand what's\n\"under the hood\" in order to do their indexing & searching.\n\nThey should be able to simply:\n\ndoc.add(new NumericField(\"price\", 15.50);\n\n\n\nAnd have a decent default precisionStep selected for them.\n\nActually, if we add ctors to NumericField for each of the supported\ntypes (so the above code works), we can set the default per-type.  I\nthink we should do that?\n\n4 for int and 6 for long was proposed as good defaults.\n\nThe default need not be \"perfect\", as advanced users can always\noptimize their precisionStep, and for users experiencing slow\nRangeQuery performance, NumericRangeQuery with any of the defaults we\nare discussing will be much faster.",

If you would do it in the constructor, the resulting code would be very error-prone. e.g., new NumericField(\"price\", 12.5): Does this mean 12.5 as double or float, is 15 alone meant as (in future) short, byte or int? OK users can add \"f\" in the float case to it, but this makes it very hard to prevent errors, because Java automatically casts all numeric types to each other suddenly. This is why I added these factories for NumericRangeQuery and the setters here. ",

            "content": "In my opinion, I would like to keep the precisionStep parameter required and give the 4 constants for each data type in NumericUtils.\n\nOn the other hand 4 is a (maybe) good default, so I propose, that all ctors/factories getting a precisionStep default it to 4, if left out. precisionStep is a final variable in NumericTokenStream (and so in NumericField), because it does not make sense to change it. If \"field\" is final, also precisionStep should be final (one field must always use the same precision step). In principle Mike is right, the type is also fixed after first calling setXxxValue, so I could throw an IAE, if somebody calles a setter for a different datatype after the first one. A IllegalStateEx is thrown, when the value was not initialized and the docinverter tries to use the token stream.\n\nHere are two ideas to fix this the defaultPrecStep per type:\n\n1. Special value 0 as default precStep:\n\n\tthe no-precStep ctor sets the precStep in NumTokenStream to 0 (invalid value), if one is given it must be >0 and <=valsize\n\twhen delivering the tokens, NumTokenStream uses the default for this data type if precStep==0 and the given value in all other cases\nIn this case the precStep is still final in NumericTokenStream, with 0 means \"automatic\".\n\n\n\n\n2. There is one other idea:\nNumericField/-TokenStream could have a required ctor param type that can be NumericField.Type.INT,... In this case the default could be choosen very simple at the beginning. And it also fixes the data type. If somebody calls setDoubleValue but has initialized the TokenStream with NumericField.Type.INT, he will get an UOE.\n\n\nThe javadocs should always clearly note, that one should check out a good precStep.\n\n\u2014\nBy the way: It is also a good idea to use valSize (32 or 64) as precisionStep in the case that you do not want to do range queries on the field (and use it only for sorting). RangeQueries would still work, but are as slow as conventional ones (current solr trunk contains this hint in its TrieField docs/schema) ",
