    "description": "OverseerTaskProcessor uses maxParallelThreads to limit number of concurrent tasks but the same is not used for creating the thread pool. The default limit of 10 is too small, IMO and we should change it to 100. The overseer collection processor mostly just waits around on network calls so there is no harm in increasing this limit.",
