    "description": "This is a spin-off from LUCENE-6572. We currently depend on the block-join module which is due to the fact that we try to highlight the queries wrapped by the block join queries. The current discussion on LUCENE-6572 mentioned that this doesn't make much sense from an highlighting perspecitve and if we should drop support for it. Lucene 8.0 would be a good time to do so.\n\nThoughts?",

            "content": "I initially added a dependency on \u2018join\u2019 as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5929. This change addressed an elasticsearch issue where standard highlighting would not work on a nested query (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6420). Because nested documents show up in the same _source as the top-level document, it was pretty natural to want the nested content to be highlighted when performing a nested query. I think we reluctantly added a dependency on \u2018join\u2019 because a better solution like a query visitor wasn\u2019t readily available.\n\nFor additional context, this issue came up several years ago, before elasticsearch supported inner_hits and the ability to highlight nested + child documents directly.
