            "content": "Here is a patch.  I tried adding this to both DoubleValuesSource and DoubleValues, and the latter turns out to be much less invasive.  It requires that DoubleValues are created with a string description, which is then used both for toString() and for the default explain().  Specialised DoubleValues can then override explain() if they want to present more complex or involved Explanations. ",
