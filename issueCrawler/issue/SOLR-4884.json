            "content": "That looks right and matches the checklist I use for LucidWorks docs.\n\nWhen checking the content, I think there are going to be pages that use plugins not in use in CWIKI that will cause errors on pages. I mentioned these in my initial comment to SOLR-4618 (item 5):\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4618?focusedCommentId=13607963&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13607963\n\nSince you have the rights to import the space, you also have the rights to add plugins. Or, I can remove references to them from the export I made and resubmit it. The really big one is the Navigation Plugin, which I used to add Next-Previous-Up page links at the bottom of nearly every page, it's also the easiest to remove if necessary. That plugin, however, is the most difficult to find and install - for some reason it's not in Atlassian's plugin marketplace, but I can upload the .jar for you if you want or point you to where I got it.\n\nI'll be interested to see how all the page formatting survives through autoexport - particularly the page with all the language tokenizers/filters.\n\nIf you don't like the stylesheet (assuming it survives the import; I can't remember if it does or not), it can be easily removed/modified from Space Admin -> Stylesheet.

We just have to review+fix+iterate.\n\nSince you have the rights to import the space, you also have the rights to add plugins.\n\nI'm going to avoid doing that w/o explicit sign off from infra on the individual plugins since it involves running arbitrary binary code downloaded from a third party on apache.org hardware and i don't wnat to me the guy who fucks that up and lets in the trojan.\n\nOr, I can remove references to them from the export I made and resubmit it.\n\nAh ... interesting, i hadn't considered that it might be easier to fix on the lucid side and then re-import.  I'll keep that in mind.\n\nIf you don't like the stylesheet...\n\ni'm not worried about the styling in confluence since it will have to be redone for the autoexport anyway and that's configured differently .. low priority.
