            "content": "Thank you very much for contributing this, its true there is no factory for this feature.\n\nI updated your code with a few tweaks:\n\n\tallow null dictionary. This allows the use of just the hyphenation grammar (LUCENE-1287)\n\tallow encoding to be specified (but default to UTF-8). Some of the grammar distributions from offo dont use UTF-8 encoding.\n\tset onlyLongestMatch default to 'false'. this is just to be consistent with the TokenFilter itself, which defaults to false.\n\tadded the Apache-licensed danish grammar to test-files, along with a small dictionary and some test cases.\n\n\n\nif no one objects, i'll commit in a bit.
