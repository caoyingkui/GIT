    "description": "We are experiencing an issue in our production servers where the indices get out of sync. Customers will see different results/result sorting depending of the instance that serves the request.\n\nWe currently have 2 instances with a single shard. This is our update handler configuration\n\n<updateHandler class=\"solr.DirectUpdateHandler2\">\n  <autoCommit>\n    <!-- do a hard commit every 10 minutes -->\n    <maxTime>600000</maxTime>\n    <!-- or when there are more than 5000 pending documents -->\n    <maxDocs>5000</maxDocs>\n    <!-- save the changes to persistent storage but don't open a new search -->\n    <openSearcher>false</openSearcher>\n  </autoCommit>\n\n  <autoSoftCommit>\n    <!-- make changes visible every 5 seconds -->\n    <maxTime>5000</maxTime>\n  </autoSoftCommit>\n\n  <updateLog>\n    <str name=\"dir\">${solr.data.dir:}</str>\n  </updateLog>\n</updateHandler>\n\nWhen the indices get out of sync the follower replica ends up with a higher version than the master. Optimizing the leader or reloading the follower core doesn't not help. The only why to get the indices in sync is to restart the server.\n\nThis is an state example of the leader:\n\nversion: 1102541\nnumDocs: 214007\nmaxDoc: 370861\ndeletedDocs: 156854 \n\nWhile the follower core has the following state:\n\nversion: 1109143\nnumDocs: 213890\nmaxDoc: 341585\ndeletedDocs: 127695",

Mine is also a single sharded setup, while the issue markus mentions is for multiple shards so I'm not sure if this is really a duplicate. I'm currently running solr 4.1.0. "
