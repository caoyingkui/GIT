    "description": "Stumbled upon this by accident when I reviewed the code. The previous associations impl never rolled-up. The assumption is that association values are given to exact categories and have no hierarchical meaning. For instance if a document is associated with two categories: Category/CS/Algo and Category/CS/DataStructure with weights 0.95 and 0.43 respectively, it is not associated with Category/CS with weight 1.38! \n\nIf the app wants to association values to apply to parents in the hierarchy as well, it needs to explicitly specify that (as in passing the hierarchy categories with their own association value).\n\nI will fix the bug and also make sure the app cannot trip it by accidentally specifying hierarchical on these categories, or that if it does (cause e.g. it indexes the categories for both counting and assoc values) then we don't apply the association to all the categories in the hierarchy.",

            "content": "Patch removes the call to rollup(). I checked and the rest is not a problem today:\n\n\n\tWe don't allow setting the association dimensions as hierarchical\n\tWe only encode the exact category's ordinal w/ the associated value, and not its parents\n\tWe do add all the category's path components as drill-down terms, which is good. I means you can associate a document with a/b/c=0.4, and still find this document if a drill-down on a/ is made\n\n\n\nSo all in all it was just the rollup() call that had to be removed. I plan to commit this shortly. ",

Because DimConfig.hierarchical=false, and rollup() does if (ft.hierarchical && ft.multiValued == false) {, it means we're just wasting a fraction of a CPU today... but there's no bug per se. I will backport if it's important, but I didn't even plan to mention that in CHANGES . ",
