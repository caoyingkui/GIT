    "description": "The random streaming expression is not registered in the /stream or /graph handler, so cannot be used with these handlers.\n\nThis is a weakness of the test cases, which only exercise the /stream handler through the parallel test cases. Tests for functions that don't work with the parallel function, like the random function don't exercise the /stream handler. Typically scale testing catches unregistered functions but in this case it has fallen through the cracks.\n\nTo avoid this we should add a test that exercises the /stream handler for all functions that don't run in parallel.",
