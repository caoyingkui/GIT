Threads can be started and never stopped and the test framework will rightly flip out. We should track and ensure proper cleanup of more of our closeable objects. I'll start with ConnectionManagers and SolrJ clients as I have already had to do this work for SOLR-4509. There are others we should look at as well though. ",
