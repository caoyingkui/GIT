And not all JIRAs that should have that label do have that label. So feel free to look at JIRAs with that label, but if you see some other JIRA that interests you or seems approachable, feel free to tackle it.\n\nFree advice .\n\nIf you find yourself becoming lost while working on a JIRA, add a comment outlining your confusion. Sometimes a sentence or two from someone more familiar with the code can save you a great deal of time. Asking questions that show you've tried to figure it out but are stuck is perfectly acceptable, we all do that at various times. ",
