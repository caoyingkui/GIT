Mistranslation when taking it from reflection compatibility code.\n\nI've also heavily tested manually entering and exiting safe mode pretty heavily. It's much more difficult to simulate a natural safe mode situation. Given Hbase uses the code and has for a long time and the difference in using a proper (though odd), client side API (unlike the current method that depends on catching exceptions passed through a remote class), we can expect that if it works for manual safe mode, it will work for naturally entered safe mode.
