    "description": "I enabled security on my solr cloud and added basic authentication and authorization to allow only specific users to read and update the records. What I observed that update works fine but read does not stop from anonymous access. \n\nOn digging deeper I saw that RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin.java has incorrectly defined the read permissions as follows:\n\nread :\n{\" +\n          \"      path:['/update/*', '/get']}\n,\" +\n\nIt should be /select/* rather than /update/*",

A bunch of fixes, including SOLR-8617, will be backported to the 5.3 branch, and 5.3.2 will most likely be announced within the next 2-3 weeks.  Upgrading to 5.4.0 is still recommended, as it includes more changes and fixes than 5.3.2 will. ",
