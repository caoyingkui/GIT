Sign up for the solr-user mailing list and ask questions there, the list is usually very responsive. http://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc\n\nWhen you write to the list, please include a bit more context, i.e. what field type you use when indexing, how you query (paste exact query string that you attempted), what you have tried already and perhaps a concrete example of what you expected the result to be. To me this sounds like a simple OR query (q.op=OR).\n\nI'm closing this issue. Please don't reply here, but followup in the mailing list. ",
