    "description": "When JavaBinCodec encounters a class it doesn't have explicit knowledge of how to serialize, nor does it implement the ObjectResolver interface, it currently serializes the object as the classname, colon, then toString() of the object.\n\nThis may appear innocent but not throwing an exception hides bugs.  One example is that the UpdateLog, which uses JavaBinCodec, to save a document.  The result is that this bad value winds up there, gets deserialized as a String in PeerSync (which uses /get) and then this value pretends to be a suitable value to the final document in the leader.  But of course it isn't.",

            "content": "Here's a patch.  I isolated the change to TransactionLog.java and added a test.  I don't love where I put the test but I'm not sure of a more suitable place.\n\nOriginally I tried making the change on JavaBinCodec but there are a bunch of things that get serialized by BinaryResponseWriter like a Lucene Explaination, Directory, and Java Throwable.  Possibly others.  So instead of playing wack-a-mole there I limited the scope of this to where it's most important.\n\nTests pass. ",
