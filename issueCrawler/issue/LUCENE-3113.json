    "description": "In LUCENE-3064, we beefed up MockTokenizer with assertions, and I've switched over the analysis tests to use MockTokenizer for better coverage.\n\nHowever, this found a few bugs (one of which is LUCENE-3106):\n\n\tincrementToken() after it returns false in CommonGramsQueryFilter, HyphenatedWordsFilter, ShingleFilter, SynonymFilter\n\tmissing end() implementation for PrefixAwareTokenFilter\n\tdouble reset() in QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer and ReusableAnalyzerBase\n\tmissing correctOffset()s in MockTokenizer itself.\n\n\n\nI think it would be nice to just fix all the bugs on one issue... I've fixed everything except Shingle and Synonym",
