For example, maybe the default for &rows in the mlt handler should be &mlt.count.\n\nAnd maybe the doc could be improved a little. I would note that mlt.count is ONLY listed under the MLT search component and NOT mentioned in the handler. The doc for the handler shoulder probably explicitly say that it uses &rows rather than &mlt.count. "
