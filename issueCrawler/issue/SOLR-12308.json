    "description": "The LISTALIASES command might return a stale response due to the default eventual consistency of reads of ZooKeeper. \u00a0I think if someone calls this command (which generally won't be rapid-fire), they deserve an up to date response. \u00a0This is easily done with a one-liner; patch forthcoming.\n\nReturning stale alias info is the only plausible explanation I have for why a recent CI failure for AliasesIntegrationTest.tearDown() failed to detect aliases to be deleted. It calls listAliases to know which aliases exist so it can then delete them 1st.\n https://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-master-Solaris/1833/\ntearDown then\u00a0calls MiniSolrCloudCluster.deleteAllCollections() which interestingly grabs a ZkStateReader.createClusterStateWatchersAndUpdate().... perhaps this ought to delete all aliases as well since, after all, if there were any aliases then well deleting all collections is bound to fail. \u00a0Should I file a separate issue or just handle this together?",
