    "description": "From SOLR-1301:\n\n\"For posterity, there is a thread on the dev list where we are working through an issue with Saxon on java 8 and ibm's j9. Wolfgang filed https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/1944 upstream. (Saxon is pulled in via cdk-morphlines-saxon).\"\n\nDue to this issue, several Morphline tests were made to be 'ignored' in java 8+. The Saxon issue has been fixed in 9.5.1-5, so we should upgrade and reinstate those tests.",
