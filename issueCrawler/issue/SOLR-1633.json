    "description": "As noted on solr-user, SolrCell has less then ideal behavior when \"foo\" is a single value field, and literal.foo=bar is specified in the request, but Tika also produces a value for the \"foo\" field from the document.  It seems like a possible improvement here would be for SolrCell to ignore the value from Tika if it already has one that was explicitly provided (as opposed to the current behavior of letting hte add fail because of multiple values in a single valued field).\n\nIt seems pretty clear that in cases like this, the users intention is to have their one literal field used as the value.\n\nhttp://old.nabble.com/Re%3A-WELCOME-to-solr-user%40lucene.apache.org-to26650071.html#a26650071",
