See below, these tests are important to ensure the example code works!\n\tDid you manage to run it without getting an exception? I.e. you add \"Publish Date/2010/10/15\", which SSDVFF should reject because it's hierarchical?\n\tAlso, main() points to SimpleFacetsExample().runSearch() and runDrillDown(). Hmm, maybe that's why you didn't trip on the hierarchy thing?\n\n\n\nTestSimpleFacetsExample is your friend . ",
