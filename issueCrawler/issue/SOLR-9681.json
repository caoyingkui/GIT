These would be applied after any domain changes, hence useful for parent->child mapping that would otherwise match all children of any parent (SOLR-9510)\n\nThe API should also be consistent with \"filter\" at the top level of the JSON Request API (examples at http://yonik.com/solr-json-request-api/ )",

This is the right time to think about this minor API stuff, and then stick to it for the long haul!\n\nThoughts about both sides:\n\"domain\" is only for non-narrowing domain changes:\n\n\tIf filtering will be used a lot by itself, then it's simpler not to have to enclose it in an extra \"domain\"\n\n\n\n\"domain\" is for all domain changes prior to faceting:\n\n\tIf filtering will primarily be used with things like blockChildren, \"domain\" will already exist, and it's natural for the additional child filters to go right there.\n\tThe only \"narrowing\" way to change the domain (other than faceting itself), is \"filter\".  There are unlikely to be others in the future, and thus having a separate class/distinction at the syntactic level does not seem important.\n\n ",
