    "description": "TrecDocMaker skips over Trec documents if they do not have a \"Date\" line. When such a document is encountered, the code may skip over several documents until the next tag that is searched for is found.\nThe result is, instead of reading ~25M documents from the GOV2 collection, the code reads only ~23M (don't remember the actual numbers).\n\nThe fix adds a terminatingTag to read() such that the code looks for prefix, but only until terminatingTag is found. Appropriate changes were made in getNextDocData().\n\nPatch to follow",

If not, can you suggest how can I simulate it?\nI can create several documents in the TREC format and feed the TrecDocMaker with those files.\nOr ... I'll look into extending TrecDocMaker and instead of feeding it with File(s), I'll feed it with some mock documents (String), which simulate the bug. Not sure if that's doable right-away - might need to change a method to protected.\n\nAlso, I'm not near the code now, so I can't tell if DocData allows for a null Date. But I guess it's just easier to assign the current date, for simplicity (you never know if at some point date becomes a must ...).\nI kept that logic from TrecDocMaker w/o the patch ...\n\nShai ",
