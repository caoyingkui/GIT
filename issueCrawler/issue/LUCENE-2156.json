AtomicBoolean is overkill...\n\nHmm, I think even volatile is overkill \u2013 ensureOpen is only on a \"best effort\" basis; it makes no guarantee that it will be \"immediate\".  So I'll revert the changes to IndexWriter and remove the \"synchronized\" from ensureOpen. ",

If you're okay with the possible case of ensureOpen()-guarded code to fail in grotesque ways because IW was in fact closed, but your \"best effort\" failed - why not drop ensureOpen() completely? It no longer \"ensures\" anything, what is its purporse? ",
