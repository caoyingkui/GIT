    "description": "The angular UI collections UI (SOLR-4388) uses the /admin/zookeeper endpoint to identify config sets. There is now a LIST command on the admin/configs endpoint (SOLR-7995) which should be used instead.\n\nThis should be changed after 5.4 has been released, so that before that, the UI code retains compatibility with previous versions of Solr - useful for people to test new code on older versions of Solr.",
