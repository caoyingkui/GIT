    "description": "Testing merge policies was hard in the past because it could only be done by setting up and IndexWriter, adding documents and making sure that merges behave as expected. The fact that MergePolicy doesn't need an IndexWriter anymore (LUCENE-8330) should make things easier since we should now be able to simulate merges without having to create an index.",

            "content": "Here is a patch with two tests in BaseMergePolicyTestCase. One simulates what happens when appending data to an index, and the other one simulates updates that are uniformly distributed across segments based on the number of documents that they contain. Each merge policy can decide what invariants it wants to validate. These tests currently fail with TieredMergePolicy because of LUCENE-8383, LUCENE-8385 and LUCENE-8392. ",
