            "content": "Here is the current state of my work. It contains the spans patch in modified form. This first step changes the class structure to have more abstract classes and generics. At the end I will move the abstract classes and their implementations to @lucene.internal classes.\n\nMTQ will still have all rewrite modes as final constants (except span), but implementations will go away.\n\nFor backwards compatibility i would keep empty subclasses of the 3.0 classes that were public (like the autorewrite) like the empty TermAttributeImpl skeleton.

All tests in core and contrib pass, javadocs build fine:\n\n\n\tSome trivial implementations of rewrite methods stay in MTQ itsself\n\tAll rewrite constants stay in MTQ\n\tSpan Rewrites are in the span wrapper class only. To be type safe, the span rewrites have a super class and the wrapper class only accepts this superclass as rewrite method. The SpanRewriteMethod also uses covariant return types to be type-safe.\n\tSpanRewrites and wrapper class got missing equals/hashCode\n\n ",

So SpanQuery.getField() cannot simply be delegated in the wrapper. A hack was added that uses reflection to find the field name from the wrapped MTQ.\n\n\n\nThe other parts were straightforward:\n\n\tmerge patch, for MTQ conflict choose \"overwrite with their's\", keep a backup of old MTQ\n\tcopypaste all code from old MTQ rewrite modes to the new separate file with rewrite modes.\n\tremove docFreq parameter from collect() method.\n\n ",
