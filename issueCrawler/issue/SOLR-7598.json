            "content": "Ishan: feedback on patch...\n\n1) i don't see the value in making every testcase have the same \"if\" block in it \u2013 why not just have that in the test util class?\n2) i'm not sure how valuable the \"savedLocale\" behavior in SaslZkACLProviderTest is, but if we're going to do it in that test, we should do it in every similarly affected test \u2013 the alternative being to simply \"assume()\" we're not in an affected locale and skip the test if we are\n\ni would suggest making \"brokenLanguagesWithMiniKdc\" array private and replace it's usage with something like this...\n\n\n/** \n *returns the currently set locale, and overrides it with {@link Locale#US} if it's \n * currently something MiniKdc can not handle\n *\n * @see Locale#setDefault\n */\npublic static final Locale overrideLocaleIfNotSpportedByMiniKdc() {\n  Locale old = Locale.getDefault();\n  if (brokenLanguagesWithMiniKdc.contains(Locale.getDefault().getLanguage())) {\n    Locale.setDefault(Locale.US);\n  }\n  return old;\n}\n\n\n\n...and then in every test...\n\n\n// setup\nsavedLocale = KerberosTestUtil.overrideLocaleIfNotSpportedByMiniKdc();\n\n//tearDown\nLocale.setDefault(savedLocale);\n\n\n\nmake sense?\n\n\n\nFWIW: I had forgotten about SOLR-7183 .. probably makes sense to resolve this issue as a dup and track this work there.
