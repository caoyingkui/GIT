    "description": "When using CloudSolrServer if you make a request as like LukeRequest it uses LBHttpSolrServer internally and it sends request to just one Solr Node (via HttpSolrServer) as round robin. So you may get different results for same requests at different times event nothing changes. Using a PropagateServer inside CloudSolrServer will fix that bug.",
