    "description": "IIUC idField has nothing to do with the <uniqueKey> field. It's really\nthe field used to route documents. Agreed, this is often the \"id\"\nfield, but still....\n\nIn fact, over in UpdateReqeust.getRoutes(), it's passed as the \"id\"\nfield to router.getTargetSlice() and just works, even though\ngetTargetSlice is clearly designed to route on a field other than the\n<uniqueKey> if we didn't just pass null as the \"route\" param.\n\nThe confusing bit is that if I have a route field defined for my\ncollection and want to use CloudSolrClient I have to figure out that I\nneed to use the setIdField method to use that field for routing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe should deprecate setIdField and refactor\u00a0how this is used (i.e. getRoutes). Need to beef up tests too I suspect.",

David's comment that testing the route field is rarely done is worrisome.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's at least worth looking at those two JIRAs for hints, but I suspect they're tangentially related at best, and probably this Jira can be fixed independently of those other two.
