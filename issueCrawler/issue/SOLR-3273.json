    "description": "We have an application based on a recent copy of 4.0-SNAPSHOT. We have a preformance test setup where we performance test our application (and therefore indirectly Solr(Cloud)). When we run the performance test against a setup using SolrCloud without replication, everything seems to run very nicely for days. When we add replication to the setup the same performance test shows some problems - which we will report (and maybe help fix) in distinct issues here in jira.\n\nAbout the setup - the setup is a little more complex than described below, but I believe the description will tell \"enough\":\nWe have two solr servers which we start from <solr-install>/example using this command (ZooKeepers have been started before) - we first start solr on server1, and then starts solr on server2 after solr on server1 finished starting up: \n\nnohup java -Xmx4096m -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -DzkHost=server1:2181,server2:2181,server3:2181 -Dbootstrap_confdir=./myapp/conf -Dcollection.configName=myapp_conf -Dsolr.solr.home=./myapp -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties -jar start.jar >./myapp/logs/stdout.log 2>./myapp/logs/stderr.log &\n\n\nThe ./myapp/solr.xml looks like this on server1:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<solr persistent=\"false\">\n  <cores adminPath=\"/admin/myapp\" host=\"server1\" hostPort=\"8983\" hostContext=\"solr\">\n    <core name=\"collA_slice1_shard1\" instanceDir=\".\" dataDir=\"collA_slice1_data\" collection=\"collA\" shard=\"slice1\" />\n  </cores>\n</solr>\n\n\nThe ./myapp/solr.xml looks like this on server2:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<solr persistent=\"false\">\n  <cores adminPath=\"/admin/myapp\" host=\"server2\" hostPort=\"8983\" hostContext=\"solr\">\n    <core name=\"collA_slice1_shard2\" instanceDir=\".\" dataDir=\"collA_slice1_data\" collection=\"collA\" shard=\"slice1\" />\n  </cores>\n</solr>\n\n\n\nThe first thing we observe is that Solr server1 (running collA_slice1_shard1) seems to start up nicely, but when Solr server2 (running collA_slice1_shard2) is started up later it quickly reports the following in its solr.log an keeps doing that for a long time:\n\nSEVERE: Error while trying to recover:org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Not Found\n\nrequest: http://server1:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=PREPRECOVERY&core=collA_slice1_shard1&nodeName=server2%3A8983_solr&coreNodeName=server2%3A8983_solr_collA_slice1_shard2&state=recovering&checkLive=true&pauseFor=6000&wt=javabin&version=2\n        at org.apache.solr.common.SolrExceptionPropagationHelper.decodeFromMsg(SolrExceptionPropagationHelper.java:40)\n        at org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.CommonsHttpSolrServer.request(CommonsHttpSolrServer.java:445)\n        at org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.CommonsHttpSolrServer.request(CommonsHttpSolrServer.java:264)\n        at org.apache.solr.cloud.RecoveryStrategy.sendPrepRecoveryCmd(RecoveryStrategy.java:188)\n        at org.apache.solr.cloud.RecoveryStrategy.doRecovery(RecoveryStrategy.java:285)\n        at org.apache.solr.cloud.RecoveryStrategy.run(RecoveryStrategy.java:206)\n\n\n\nPlease note that we have changed a little bit in the way errors are logged, but basically this means that Solr server2 gets an \"404 Not Found\" on its request \"http://server1:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=PREPRECOVERY&core=collA_slice1_shard1&nodeName=server2%3A8983_solr&coreNodeName=server2%3A8983_solr_collA_slice1_shard2&state=recovering&checkLive=true&pauseFor=6000&wt=javabin&version=2\" to Solr server1.\n\nSeems like there is not a common agreement among the Solr servers on how/where to send those requests and how/where to listen for them.\n\nRegards, Per Steffensen",

As I understand it, all the replication & etc is done for you by virtue of the leaders automatically distributing the incoming updates to all replicas so nothing useful is accomplished by turning on replication.\n\n\nIf I'm on track, maybe the right solution is for the replication code to \"do the right thing\" when running in a SolrCloud configuration, which is to do nothing. \n "

            "content": "Hi\n\nThanks for your reply. Correct me (too) if Im wrong, but I believe SolrCloud does not do replication unless it is asked to. I believe you can turn replication on by setting \"numShards > 1\" somewhere, or you can set it up more manually by making sure you have more cores defined with the same shard value (\"slice1\" in my case) in solr.xml's distributed on different solr instances - like we try to do.\n\nBut I would really like to be corrected if anyone knows that I am doing something wrong.\n\nRegards, Per Steffensen "

We don't really have a way of know what it is on the remote node. So it may be the right choice to just require that people leave it as is for solrcloud (though of course we should doc this). "
