    "description": "The SolrJ query operation fails to set the character encoding when doing a GET. It works when doing a POST.\n\nThe problem is that URLs are urlencoded with UTF-8 but the Content-type: header is not set. I tested it with \"Content-Type:text/plain;charset=utf-8\" and that worked. The Content-type header encoding defaults to ISO 8859-1.\n\nThe result is that SolrJ queries fail for any search with a character above 127. The work around is to use a POST query instead of a GET. I have not searched for other places. So, change: \n\nQueryResponse qr = CommonsHttpSolrServer.query(query);\n\n\nto:\n\nQueryResponse qr = CommonsHttpSolrServer.query(query, SolrRequest.METHOD.POST);\n\n\nOne quirk of this behavior is that url-bashing a query string with an ISO 8859-1 character (like an umlaut) works in a browser, but fails in a SolrJ request.. It also searches correctly from the admin/index.jsp and admin/form.jsp pages, because they set the content-type in the FORM declaration.",

The code will work, because POST explicitly sets UTF-8.\nThis patch does the same default for queries.\n\nAs I said, seeing the right characters in all of the moving parts is tricky. Tracking all of this is easier with a tcp/ip monitor; I used apache's tcpmon.\n\n\n "
