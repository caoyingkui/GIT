The SortingResponseWriter test has some null testing built in also but it's much easier to test the /export handler through a Streaming Expression.\n\nAlso we'll need a way to compare the behavior of nulls from both the /select handler and the /export handler to make sure we have something that works for the SQLHandler. The StreamExpressionTest is the right place to switch back and forth between the two handlers.\n\nMore tests to come. ",
