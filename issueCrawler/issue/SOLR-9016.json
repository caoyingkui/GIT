    "description": "SolrIdentifierValidator accepts shard, collection, cores and alias names following this pattern:\n\n\n^(?!\\\\-)[\\\\._A-Za-z0-9\\\\-]*$\n\n\n\nThis accepts an \"empty\" name. This is easily fixable by changing the * to +. However, it also accepts names such as .., ,__--- etc. Do we not want to require collection names to have a letter/digit identifier in them? Something like the following pattern:\n\n\n^(\\\\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9]+[\\\\._\\\\-a-zA-Z0-9]*$\n\n\n\nThat pattern requires the name to start with an optional . followed by a series of letters/digits followed by the rest of the allowed characters.\n\nWhat do you think?",

            "content": "I think this makes sense. It adds more restrictions to the regular expression that we currently have and so people who actually (for whatever reason) have been creating collections with names like the ones you mentioned above would run into issues but I think we shouldn't be worried about those use-cases.\n\nI think this could also go into 5.5.1 unless there's someone who thinks this wouldn't be the right time/release version. So, without any bike shedding, we should skip this change only if there are any strong objections. ",

I'll be happy to change that, but since I didn't receive any feedback I think this fix is the least we can do (and also push into 5.5.1).\n\nThe patch also modifies the exception message slightly. ",
