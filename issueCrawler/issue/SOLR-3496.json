    "description": "Prior to 3.6, if you did a query like this:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=AND\n\n\n...you would get an exception and stacktrace in the response like this:\n\nProblem accessing /solr/select. Reason:\n\norg.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: Cannot parse 'AND'....\n\n\nIn 3.6, you get something like this:\n\nProblem accessing /solr/select. Reason:\n\nnull\n\n\nI think the old behavior was preferable \n\nIt looks like this was broken by SOLR-3022. Quick fix I think would be to change this:\n\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, Throwable th) {\n    this(code, null, th, (th instanceof SolrException) ? ((SolrException)th).logged : false);\n  }\n\n\nTo this:\n\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, Throwable th) {\n    this(code, th.toString(), th, (th instanceof SolrException) ? ((SolrException)th).logged : false);\n  }",
