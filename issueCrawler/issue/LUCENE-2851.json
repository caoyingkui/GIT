    "description": "When I try to highlight a Chinese document using org.apache.lucene.search.highlight.Highlighter, I end up with a corrupted document from getBestTextFragments().  This corruption happens both when I try to highlight a pure English query or when I try to highlight a pure Chinese query.  \n\nI believe that this issue is related to LUCENE-1500 which was closed by preventing an exception from being thrown but did not fix the underlying problem.",
