    "description": "If hl.q parameter is set, HighlightComponent uses it rather than q.\n\nUse case:\n\nYou search \"PC\" with highlight and facet capability:\n\n\nq=PC\n&facet=on&facet.field=maker&facet.field=something\n&hl=on&hl.fl=desc\n\n\n\nYou get a lot of results with snippets (term \"PC\" highlighted in desc field). Then you click a link \"maker:DELL(50)\" to narrow the result:\n\n\nq=PC\n&facet=on&facet.field=something\n&fq=maker:DELL\n&hl=on&hl.fl=desc\n\n\n\nYou'll get narrowed result with term \"PC\" highlighted snippets. But, sometimes I'd like to see \"DELL\" to be highlighted as well, because I clicked \"DELL\". In this case, hl.q can be used:\n\n\nq=PC\n&facet=on&facet.field=something\n&fq=maker:DELL\n&hl=on&hl.fl=desc&*hl.q=PC+maker:DELL*\n\n\n\nNote that hl.requireFieldMatch should be false (false is default) in this scenario.",

Although hl.text params makes much more sense, it seams to keep a Query object in response builder would be easier. From what I see in the code, I think set/getHighlightQuery() should not be in QParser. Anyway, setting highlight query of response builder during query preperation might do the trick. "
