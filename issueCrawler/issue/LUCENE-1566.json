    "description": "This is not a Lucene issue, but I want to open this so future google\ndiggers can more easily find it.\n\nThere's this nasty bug in Sun's JRE:\n\n  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6478546\n\nThe gist seems to be, if you try to read a large (eg 200 MB) number of\nbytes during a single RandomAccessFile.read call, you can incorrectly\nhit OOM.  Lucene does this, with norms, since we read in one byte per\ndoc per field with norms, as a contiguous array of length maxDoc().\n\nThe workaround was a custom patch to do large file reads as several\nsmaller reads.\n\nBackground here:\n\n  http://www.nabble.com/problems-with-large-Lucene-index-td22347854.html",

Catch the error \n\nI added a workaround to FSDirectory / NIOFSDirectory / SimpleFSDirectory as well as a testcase to test the added code for correctness.

Haven't had time to install the JVMs (or at least one) listed in the Sun Bug Report. Reading in chunks into a big array is fine.\n\nHow about, instead of ignoring the chunk size on 64bit jre, we\nconditionally default it to Long.MAX_VALUE?\n\nHmm, would remove \"code duplication\" - good point. The readBytes method seems to be critical but I guess there won't be any performance impact by assigning one or two extra variables. \n\nCan you link also to the Sun VM bug in the javadocs for these\nset/getChunkSize?\n\nSure, I will also add CHANGES.TXT in the patch.\nwill do as soon as I get into the office tomorrow.\n ",
