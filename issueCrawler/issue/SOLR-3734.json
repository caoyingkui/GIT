But the \"/schema-browser?field=foo\" URLs only seem to work if that field actaully exists in the luke?numTerms=0 response \u2013 even if they are legal because of dynamicField.\n\nSo, for example, this address_s URL doesn't work in the UI  using the example configs on trunk if you have no data indexed, but once you index the sample data it does start to work...\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/#/collection1/schema-browser?field=address_s\n\nI think the \"correct\" fixes would be...\n\n\n\tthe UI should not freak out if a copySources or copyDest refers to a field or dynamic field pattern it doesn't know about.  it should list it in the display as usual and provide the appropriate ?field=foo or ?field=foo_* link (depending on wether the copySource contains a wildcard.\n\tif someone clicks on one of those links, and there is no field data available about a field (because it isn't explicitly declared, nor does it exist in the index, so it's not returned by the luke?numTerms=0 request) then the UI should display a simple warning \"Field not found in index, no details available\" or something like that.\n\n\n\nWe can probably look into improving that second case in the future (so even if it's not in the index, and wasn't returned by the luke?numTerms-0 request, the UI should be able to ask luke for info about a field by name, and have luke response back with \"not currently in the index, but it is a legal field name because of dynamicField foo_*, and heres' the fieldType and field flags\")\n\n\n\n "
