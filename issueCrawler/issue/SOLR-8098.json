    "description": "I don't think this is necessarily a bug, just writing it down here and tracking it so we have a reference.\n\nCame up with an interesting case when I was testing Immutable ConfigSets.  I had defined a managed schema example as Immutable and was checking that all the files defined as part of the ConfigSet were present in ZooKeeper.  Occasionally, schema.xml was missing, which was surprising to me because I wasn't able to modify the schema (because it was Immutable).  Turns out that the managed schema renames the schema.xml when a collection is created using the schema, it doesn't need to be modified.\n\nIn theory we could build in some smarts to the ManagedIndexSchema to know it's immutable and so can avoid doing the rename, but it doesn't seem like we can handle this in general, i.e. any user-written schema can just do all sorts of schema modifications under the covers and decide not to check immutability.",
