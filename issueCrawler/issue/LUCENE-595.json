    "description": "Building index on a 3Gbyte of plain text (with 4 additional fields with a max size of 300 bytes everyone) produce an OutOfMemoryError (on the heap space).  The 3GBytes data are composed of about 30.000 files with a max size of 15MByte spitted into 3 dirs (10.000 files /dir).\n\nI've tried JVM with -Xmx300M without any success.  I also tried to setMaxBufferedDocs(5)  on the indexWriter, without any results.\n\nTIA\nRoberto Colmegna",
