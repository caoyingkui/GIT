    "description": "SuggesterFactory warns with a full exception stack trace (FNFE) in init()\nif the directory exists, but not the file.\n\nThis could be confusing since it itself makes the directory in init(),\nso if someone just hasnt built yet they might see a huge scary stacktrace.\n\nI think ideally it wouldnt do the mkdirs() until build... and perhaps the\nwarning could be tailored to fit better (found directory but no data file),\netc.",
