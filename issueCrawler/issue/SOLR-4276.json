    "description": "We upgraded from Solr 3.6 to Solr 4.0. Unfortunately the behaviour of how to retrieve a document from the index by a unique key has apparently changed.\n\nIn Solr 3.6 the following query retrieves a single document:\n\nkey:conf/socc/AscottS09\n\nBut when using Solr 4.0 with the same document collection (re-indexed) an empty result list is returned. It seems that Solr 4.0 is processing/analyzing the term conf/socc/AscottS09 even though it is of type solr.StrField. The query works as expected in Solr 4.0 when the term in enclosed in quotation marks:\n\nkey:\"conf/socc/AscottS09\"                \n\nschema.xml:\n\n...\n<fieldType name=\"string\"  class=\"solr.StrField\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" mitNorms=\"true\"/>\n...\n<field name=\"key\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" multiValued=\"false\" required=\"true\"/>\n...\nIs this a bug or have there been any changes on how Solr processes the string field?\n\nThe analyzer in the admin ui does it right. But when using the query field in the admin ui with enabled debug mode it shows that the term gets analyzed and tokenized:\n\n<str name=\"rawquerystring\">key:conf/socc/AscottS09</str><str name=\"querystring\">key:conf/socc/AscottS09</str><str name=\"parsedquery\">+key:conf +RegexpQuery(text:/socc/) +(+text:ascotts09 +text:ascott +text:s +text:09)</str><str name=\"parsedquery_toString\">+key:conf +text:/socc/ +(+text:ascotts09 +text:ascott +text:s +text:09)</str\n\nsee also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13511969/solr-4-0-searching-in-string-field",
