Although I would most likely would prefer to the cygwin version in my own incidental usage, I couldn't be sure that I wouldn't be breaking other software, and clearly that can happen.\n\nUsing \"%windir%\\System32\\find.exe\" instead of just \"find\" seems to work.  Would that be a reasonable idea to use in the script?  I didn't see any default system environment variables pointing directly at the System32 subdirectory.  If there are any other system utilities that the script uses without explicit paths, it might be a good idea to utilize environment variables to locate them in their expected places.\n\nThis is my PATH variable:\n\n\nC:\\Users\\sheisey>echo %path%\nC:\\ProgramData\\Oracle\\Java\\javapath;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AMD APP\\bin\\x86_64;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AMD APP\\bin\\x86;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_27\\bin;C:\\Windows\\system32;C:\\Windows;C:\\Windows\\System32\\Wbem;C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Roxio Shared\\9.0\\DLLShared\\;C:\\Windows\\System32\\Windows System Resource Manager\\bin;C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseSVN\\bin;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ATI Technologies\\ATI.ACE\\Core-Static;C:\\cygwin64\\bin;C:\\apache-ant-1.9.6\\bin;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GNU\\GnuPG\\pub;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\Client SDK\\ODBC\\110\\Tools\\Binn\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\120\\Tools\\Binn\\ManagementStudio\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\120\\Tools\\Binn\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\120\\DTS\\Binn\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\QuickTime\\QTSystem\\;C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\\n\n ",
