            "content": "-0\n\nThis seem like a scary default behavior \u2013 particularly since TopDocs.totalHits is still going to be there in the response object containing non-deterministic data (IIUC the docs make no garuntees unless\u00a0trackTotalHits=true \u2013 so it's not like we even have a \"-1\" sentinal value, and it's not a method that we could make throw an UnsupportedOperationException if the original collector had trackTotalHits=false ) ... and especially since existing users who already have code that calls TopScoreDocCollector.create(42) won't see any sort of compilation error on upgrade \u2013 their code will just starrt lying to them about hte number of total hits.\n\ncouldn't we at least use a new static method name, and deprecate the old single arg\u00a0create(int) ??\u00a0 that way nothing will change out from under people.
