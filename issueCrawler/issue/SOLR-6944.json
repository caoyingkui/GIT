I also saw this happen more when removing the httpclient stale check as well - but it can obviously happen with the stale check as well. It seems to be much worse on these tests because of the proxy stuff they do. When it does happen, you pretty much have to retry - NoHttpResponseException happens when the full request is sent, so an auto retry is not safe unless it's a query and not an update. ",

There are two places that need fixing:\n\n\tin HttpSolrClient - we should always call ClientConnectionManager.closeExpiredConnections() if we get a NoHttpResponseException, whether or not we retry (see SOLR-7203)\n\tin CloudSolrClient.  We have a couple of options here: call closeExpiredConnections() in a background thread (we already have an executorservice here, so we can just use that), or alternatively call it whenever there's a change in the cluster state.  I quite like the latter idea - it would be useful to have a generic 'register a callback that gets called whenever the cluster state changes' API on ZkStateReader, and CloudSolrClient could just use that.\n\n ",
