    "description": "Currently cores are registered in parallel in an executor. However, when there's a ZK expiration, the recovery, which also happens in the register call, happens in a single thread:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cloud/ZkController.java#L300\n\nWe should make these happen in parallel as well so that recovery after ZK expiration doesn't take forever.\n\nThanks to Jessica Cheng Mallet for catching this.",

            "content": "Simple patch that registers cores in the background after ZK session expiration. I had to add some getter methods for the ExecutionService in the ZkContainer so that it is available to the ZkController when needed (iff cc is not null). I didn't want to use a new ExecutionService since the one setup by ZkContainer seemed most appropriate for this work, but you can't expose ZkContainer directly in ZkController because it's only a server-side thing.
