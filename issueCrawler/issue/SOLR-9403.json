    "description": "Now that SOLR-9252 is committed it would be useful to deploy an AI classifier during re-ranking. \n\nThe classify function query will retrieve a model from a SolrCloud collection and run the model on documents. The function will return the score from the model. When used with the re-ranker this will re-rank the top N documents by the score from the model.\n\nThe classify function can be used with the re-ranker using the function qparser plugin.\n\nThe suggested syntax:\n\nrq={!rerank reRankQuery=$rqq reRankDocs=20}&rqq={!func}classify(collection, modelID, textField)",
