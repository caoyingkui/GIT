    "description": "(following up on comments initially posted on SOLR-7275).\n\nBack in Solr 4 days, user authentication could be handled by Jetty, and some level of authorization could be implemented using request regexp rules. This was explicitly documented in the SolrSecurity page:\n\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrSecurity?action=recall&rev=35#Jetty_realm_example\n\nIn particular, authentication could thus be performed against a variety of services implemented in Jetty, such as HashLoginService (mentioned explicitly in the above documentation, tested in production, does work) or possibly JAASLoginService, which in turn would open up the possibility to use a whole range of auth services (in particular LDAP servers).\n\nI see that the usage of Jetty is now \"an implementation detail\". Does this mean that the feature listed above is not supported anymore? (This is quite unfortunate IMO, as even just the HashLoginService would be useful to authenticate users against a database of UNIX crypt(3) passwords)\n\nThe new login services that are apparently being reimplemented in Solr itself seem to be much less flexible and limited.",

But you will be on your own for the next upgrade or if/when we stop using Jetty to power Solr.\n\nYour best action forward would be to describe what you are not able to do with our current Auth/Authz plugins, and see if there is interest in adding what you need, e.g. HashLogin. It is actually not very difficult to write your own security custom plugin either, perhaps wrapping the functionality from an existing library.\n\nThis issue will probably be closed as Won't fix  ",
