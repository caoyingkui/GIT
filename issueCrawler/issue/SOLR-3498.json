It seems like setCommitWithin() is ignored in my ContentStreamUpdateRequest request, and that I need to use setParam(UpdateParams.COMMIT_WITHIN, \"...\") instead to get the desired effect.\n\n\nSolrServer solrServer = new HttpSolrServer(\"http://localhost:8983/solr\");\nContentStreamUpdateRequest updateRequest = new ContentStreamUpdateRequest(\"/update/extract\");\nupdateRequest.addFile(file);\nupdateRequest.setParam(\"literal.id\", file.getName());\nupdateRequest.setCommitWithin(10000); // Does not work\n//updateRequest.setParam(UpdateParams.COMMIT_WITHIN, \"10000\"); // Works\nupdateRequest.process(solrServer);\n\n\n\nIf I use the below\n\n\n...\n//updateRequest.setCommitWithin(10000); // Does not work\nupdateRequest.setParam(UpdateParams.COMMIT_WITHIN, \"10000\"); // Works\n...\n\n\n\nI get the desired result and a commit is being done.\n\nI'm doing this on 3.x, but I believe this issue could apply to 4.x as well (by quickly glancing over the code with tired eyes), but I haven't verified this, yet.",
