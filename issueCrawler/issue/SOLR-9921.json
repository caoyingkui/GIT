            "content": "Also, SolrMetricProducer.initializeMetrics currently returns Collection<String> with names of the registered metrics. This was originally intended as a way to ensure that at least some metrics were actually registered by a producer. However, in practice this is not that useful, and there are producers that can't know in advance what metrics they will register throughout the life-cycle of a component. For these reasons I'm planning to change this method so that it doesn't return anything. ",
