    "description": "To run as a Solr Client, you need slf4j actually configured in your classpath, because HttpSolrServer hardly depends on it, also the used libs like Commons Httpclient (and others)\n\nIn SOLR-3706 all of the slf4j JARs were made optional, but because we did not exclude the dependencies of httpclient and others explicitely, the dependency was still included by maven automatically for a user that used SolrJ - so effectively the \"optional\" was never working.\n\nIn 4.7, Steve Rowe now explicitely excluded all dependencies of all deps included via IVY. By that the implicit dependency by httpclient was killed.\n\nWhen I updated a project from SolrJ 4.6 to SolrJ 4.7, it suddenly failed to run, because it failed with a classnotfound ex directly after starting. Not even the default logging to console was enabled (which is provided by slf4j). This is bad for users of SolrJ, because they have to explicitely add a dependency for something that really required to use SolrJ.\n\nThe reason for excluding slf4j-api was that we don't want to have it in the WAR file, so it was made optional. But that is wrong:\n\n\tIn trunk we no longer have a WAR file\n\tThe primary user of SolrJ via Maven is not somebody who wants to install Solr in his appserver, its the user needing the client.\n\n\n\nSo we should restore the state from Solr 4.6, where the dep was implicitely included, by making it non-optional in Maven.\n\nWhen building the WAR file in 4.x we should exclude it somehow via Maven Magic(tm).",

It looks fine to me, solrj has the required dependency.\n\nBut I think the whole magic is not needed at all. Because solrj is required by almost all projects (contrib, solr-core,..) the declaration of \"optional\" there is not really needed? I think only the WAR file should have it optional, all others get it required, because they depend on solrj (so when you compile or use solr-core, it should also fetch solrj, if I understand it correctly?\n\nPlease correct me if this is not true.\n\nIn my opinion, all of solr should depend on slf4j-api (because its used as a hard dependency, it is not optional!). Only the WAR file should exclude it by making it optional. "
