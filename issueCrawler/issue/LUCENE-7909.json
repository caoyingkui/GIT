    "description": "Hi,\n\n\nIt seems the behavior of adding holes to polygons is not behaving well. It seems it is all related to the following method:\n\n  /** Check if a point is within the provided holes.\n   *@param point point to check.\n   *@return true if the point is within any of the holes.\n   */\n  protected boolean isWithinHoles(final GeoPoint point) {\n    if (holes != null) {\n      for (final GeoPolygon hole : holes) {\n        if (!hole.isWithin(point)) \n{\n          return true;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\nThe negation in the if clause is wrong. This affects two classes, GeoConvexPolygon and GeoConcavePolygon. I have ready a patch if you think it should be corrected.\n\nThanks,\n\nI.",

Holes describe the area outside\n   *  each hole as being \"in set\".  Null == none.\n\n\n\nThe meaning is that the polygon(s) in \"holes\" describe the area OUTSIDE the hole.  So the code is right given that. ",
