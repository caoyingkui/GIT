    "description": "If any token given to the DoubleMetaphoneFilter is empty (Token exists, 0 length), then the encoder will return null instead of a metaphone encoded string. The current code assumes that there will always be a valid object returned.\n\nProposed solution: Make sure 0-length tokens are skipped at the top branch where the code checks whether or not we have a Token object at all.",
