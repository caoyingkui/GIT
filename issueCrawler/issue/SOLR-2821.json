    "description": "Currently, we have issues supporting both incremental cluster state updates (needed because reading the state with many ZK requests does not scale) and allowing shard/node properties to change on the fly. We be nice to have a solution that allows faster cluster state reads and easy on the fly shard/node prop changes.",

Committed to the branch.\n\nI renamed the cluster state node to clusterstate.json instead of clusterstate.xml - this messed up our test zk printLayout method because it looks for the .xml to pretty print it.\n\nI have not made it pretty print the json yet, but I would def like to - its impossible to read otherwise.
