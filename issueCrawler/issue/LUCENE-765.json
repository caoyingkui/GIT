They should be updated to give a summary of the important classes, how indexing works, etc.  Maybe give an overview of how the different writers coordinate.  Links to file formats, information on the posting algorithm, etc. would be helpful.\n\nSee the search package javadocs as a sample of the kind of info that could go here.",

Here are some suggestions:\n\n\tI'm a bit reluctant to mention distributed filesystems as something that a Directory can abstract as it is usually a better idea to handle distribution on top of Lucene like Solr does with shards/replicas.\n\tIn the IndexReader section, maybe link \"open\" to DirectoryReader#open and \"refreshed\" to DirectoryReader#openIfChanged?\n\tLet's mention that doc ids are transient and only valid for a given point-in-time view of the index?\n\tDoc values mention \"rapid random-access lookup\", shouldn't it be \"rapid sequential lookup\"?\n\tLet's avoid saying that doc values may be used for retrieval as it suggests that this might be an alternative for stored fields?\n\n ",

Just to clarify - there were conflicts with the indentation changes since on master some statements about stats being unavailable depending on index configuration was removed after preserving the stats became mandatory. I read carefully, and I believe I am preserving those edits. However, if you prefer I can undo the indentation changes completely, which would make this much easier to review. Seemed like a good idea at the time ... ",
