    "description": "As part of the filter -> query migration, we should migrate the caching wrappers (including the filter cache).\n\nI think the behaviour should be to delegate to the wrapped query when scores are needed and cache otherwise like CachingWrapperFilter does today.\n\nAlso the cache should ignore query boosts so that field:value^2 and field:value^3 are considered equal if scores are not needed.",

            "content": "+1. about the FilterCache:\n\nit would be nice, for example, if it worked out of box completely with simple defaults, with some way for users to configure/disable/plug in their own on indexsearcher (e.g. setCache or policy or whatever).\n\nthis would give us freedom to cache 'implicit' filters, too using the logic we already have, for example if we see the same query over and over with needsScore=false just because it was in a booleanquery prohibited clause. \n "
