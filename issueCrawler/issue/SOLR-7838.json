One thing that I noticed was that the \"permissions\" section (both in security.json and in the output of /admin/authorization) is a JSON object but order is very important here. Now some JSON parsers adhere to JSON standard (keys in map/object are unordered) and some do not. But if we do not change this from a object/map to an array before the release, there'd be no way to change it in a back-compatible manner later.\n\nI'd vote to delay the release by a day or two and fix this now.
