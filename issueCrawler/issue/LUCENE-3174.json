    "description": "In order to support ranking methods besides TF-IDF, we need to make the statistics they need available. These statistics could be computed in computeWeight (soon to become computeStats) and stored in a separate object for easy access. Since this object will be used solely by subclasses of Similarity, it should be implented as a static inner class, i.e. Similarity.Stats.\n\nThere are two ways this could be implemented:\n\n\tas a single Similarity.Stats class, reused by all ranking algorithms. In this case, this class would have a member field for all statistics;\n\tas a hierarchy of Stats classes, one for each ranking algorithm. Each subclass would define only the statistics needed for the ranking algorithm.\n\n\n\nIn the second case, the Stats class in DefaultSimilarity would have a single field, idf, while the one in e.g. BM25Similarity would have idf and average field/document length.",

The current solution in MockBM25Similarity is not satisfactory because there is only one Similarity object at a time.\n\tMultiPhraseWeight, PhraseWeight, SpanWeight, TermWeight call computeStats and extract the IDFExplain object. This level of coupling is not desirable, and should be eliminated. All the more so, as not all Similarity subclasses will have an idf\n\tIt might not even make sense to expose computeStats()?\n\n\n\nTo consider:\n\n\tit might be better if Stats were static, because they could inherit fields from each other\n\n ",

I really like this idea.\n\nAs for Stats, I see several advantages of a single class:\n\n\tno need for casting. It may be just me, but having to cast everywhere doesn't feel right for me;\n\twe show in one place what statistics the ranking algorithms use, the user of the library doesn't need to \"hunt\" for this information;\n\tI think there will be Similarities that use the same Stats subclass, e.g. MockLMSimilarity uses TFIDFSimilarity.IDFStats. Or it could define its own Stats that looks exactly the same. Either solution seems a bit strange for me;\n\tone less class to write if you want to add a new Similarity (provided you don't need a new statistic, in which case you have to write your own and cast it).\n\n ",

Not to make any promises, but I think by doing such a thing (letting a Similarity control how the explaining works), we will make progress towards LUCENE-3118 too: if you customize the scoring system for your app, you should be able to explain the scores in a way that make sense to your app too.\n\n\nThe DocScorer factory methods now need both the Weight and the Stats; that's the best I could do for now.\n\nThis sounds like a good step to me! We want to just pass only the Stats to the DocScorer factory methods, but we have some more work to do before that... such as better handling of the whole boosting situation and pushing all responsibility for query normalization into stats.\n\nonce we have done this, i think Weight/Stats will make sense (except for naming) as it will be be the parallel of Scorer/DocScorer, full responsibility for scoring is in the Similarity and Weight/Scorer only handle things like seeking to terms, creating docsenums, iterating postings lists, etc \n ",
