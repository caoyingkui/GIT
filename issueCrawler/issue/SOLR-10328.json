    "description": "Apache Zeppelin is a Web-based notebook interface for interactive data analytics, similar to iPython/Jupyter with pluggable back-end engines. It is implemented in Java. \n\nApache Solr already integrates with Zeppelin via JDBC bridge. However, creating a Solr-specific engine (and perhaps syntax highlighter) would allow to create interactive examples for Solr as well as more rich explorative interface to Solr than is possible in current Admin UI or via JDBC bridge.",
