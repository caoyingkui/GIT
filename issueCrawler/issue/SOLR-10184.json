            "content": "thanks for the links Uwe, JEP 158 is interesting.\n\nBetween the GC logging options that have been removed, and how the unified logging now deals with multiple tags (gc, all, etc..) & output specifiers (stdout, stderr, for file) in a single '-Xlog' param; it doesn't look viable to have an exact java9 equivilent for what the bin/solr script currently does with SOLR_LOGS_DIR & GC_LOG_OPTS\n\nThe attached patch attempts to support the same ideas as best as (i can see) possible under java9...\n\n\n\tif the user doesn't configure a GC_LOG_OPTS, then we (still) use a (verbose) default value for this param via '-Xlog:gc*'\n\tif the user configures a blank value for GC_LOG_OPTS, we (still) leave the param blank\n\tif the effective value of GC_LOG_OPTS is non blank, then foreach param option specified in GC_LOG_OPTS:\n\t\n\t\tif it starts with '-Xlog:gc', and does not include an output specifier, then:\n\t\t\n\t\t\tadd a 'file' output specifier based on SOLR_LOGS_DIR (to mimic the '-Xloggc' param we use w/ java8)\n\t\t\tadd time,uptime decorators (to mimic the -XX params we use w/ java8)\n\t\t\tadd filecount=9,filesize=20000 output-options (to mimic the -XX params we use w/ java8)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n(for simplicity, if the user wants to specify multiple JEP158 tags in the '-Xlog' param , then the tag list has to start with \"gc\" in order for us to add a file option \u2013 otherwise we ignore it.  likewise if the user wants to specify their own decorators or output-options, then they must also specify their own output (file, or stdout, or stderr) specifier as well, since it must come first in the '-Xlog' format string)\n\nWhile fixing this, I also did some small cleanup in how the java -version output is parsed.\n\nWould appreciate detailed review & manual testing from folks since this type of script work is hard to write automated tests for.
