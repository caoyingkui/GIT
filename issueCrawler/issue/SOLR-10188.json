For the sake of others who come across this issue in the future, I will respond with the solution.\n\nURLs with \"#\" in them are only usable in an actual browser \u2013 the web server (the servlet container that's running Solr, in this case) never sees that character or any other character that comes after it.  Those URLs will not work with other tools like a Solr client or wget.  Removing # is not enough \u2013 the admin UI almost always has slightly different parameter/path syntax than the actual HTTP API.\n\nBelow is the wget command you'll need to initiate a full import.  The clean parameter defaults to true on full-import, so I removed it:\n\n\nwget \"http://server:8983/solr/collection1/dataimport?command=full-import\"\n\n ",
