    "description": "Currently the only way for the slave to know about the availability of of new commit points is by polling. This means slaves should 'poll'  very frequently  to ensure that it gets the commit point immediately. if the changes to the master is less frequent, then this can be an unnecessary overhead. If would be nice if the slave can register itself with the master for notification on availability of new changes. After receiving the notification , the slave can trigger a poll and do what it does now.  This may require SOLR-727 so that the slave can register its url with the master",
