However, I get a ClassCastException (cannot convert String to NamedList<Object>) thrown at AnalysisResponseBase.buildPhases method if I have included the CharMappingFilter in my configuration.\n\nIt seems that a CharFilter does not create a NamedList<Object>, but a String entry in the analysis response.",
