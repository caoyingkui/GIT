            "content": "Patch for trunk.  This changes the SolrResourceLoader constructors to take Path instead of String, and getInstanceDir() now returns a Path as well.  I've tried to keep the effects on everything else as limited as possible, to keep the size of the patch down.\n\nOne question is whether this should be a clean break for 5.4, or if I should add back the altered method signatures as deprecated.  SolrResourceLoader is an expert internal API, but there's a possibility that some plugins might use getInstanceDir(). ",

            "content": "Strong +1 for this idea!  I haven't reviewed the patch yet.\n\nWhen I started looking at NIO2 conversion for Solr (in general, not limited to this class), I noticed a lot of code that concatenates strings of harcoded filesystem or resource paths with forward slashes.  The code would be much cleaner and cross-platform with resolve and other NIO2 methods.\n\nI personally would be OK with simply changing the API, but the javadoc at the class level does not actually say that it is expert or internal.  I'm guessing deprecation will be required, unless it's sufficient to add the internal/expert designation in the javadoc at the same time as this change.  I do see one method currently marked as expert, but I don't think that method is affected by this patch. ",

This will mean changing the name of the new method, as Java doesn't let you have identically-named methods with different return types - will work up a patch to change the name to .getInstancePath(), with the deprecated .getInstanceDir() just redirecting to that.
