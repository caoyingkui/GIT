Do you mean something like [dateformat f=mydateField] and it could consume the TZ parameter in the request if provided, or let a local-param override if given?  And it would return a string of course.  This should support a 'format' parameter to allow you to format it as you wish.\n\nBTW this'd be the inverse of: http://www.solr-start.com/javadoc/solr-lucene/org/apache/solr/update/processor/ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory.html ",
