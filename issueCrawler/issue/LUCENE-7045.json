    "description": "In LUCENE-7043 we added several new point types and just gave them static methods to generate exact/range/prefix/whatever queries.\n\nI think we should do the same in general, e.g. for IntPoint:\n\nThis field defines static factory methods for creating common queries:\n<ul>\n  <li>{@link #newExactQuery newExactQuery()} for matching an exact 1D point.\n  <li>{@link #newRangeQuery newRangeQuery()} for matching a 1D range.\n  <li>{@link #newMultiRangeQuery newMultiRangeQuery()} for matching points/ranges in n-dimensional space.\n</ul>\n\n\n\nThen each Point can have types that make sense for it: e.g. multi-dimensional range queries don't make sense at all for IP addresses, but prefix query does, and polygon/distance queries make sense for LatLonPoint and so on (that one is not refactored yet here, followup!)",
