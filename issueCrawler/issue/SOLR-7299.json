I successfully manually tested standalone and cloud starting, collection/core creation, admin UI access (including client auth), healthcheck (cloud only), and stopping in both SSL and non-SSL mode.\n\nThere also is a bug in -s (solr home) param handling in bin\\solr.cmd that this patch fixes: a relative solr home dir is interpreted relative to %SOLR_SERVER_DIR% instead of relative to the current directory at script invocation.\n\nCommitting to branch_5x and lucene_solr_5_1 shortly.
