    "description": "I am using SolrJ with embedded  Solr server and some documents have a lot of text. Solr will be running on a small device with very limited memory. In my tests I cannot process more than 3MB of text (in a body) with 64MB heap. According to Java there is about 30MB free memory before I call server.add and with 5MB of text it runs out of memory.  \n\nI sent an inquiry to a mailing list and was advised to create JIRA issue.",
