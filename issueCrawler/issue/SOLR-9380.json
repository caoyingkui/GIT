    "description": "We're using SOLR to index a couple of million records resulting in an index of around 60 GiB.\n\nOn this index, we're running BIG queries. Big being queries of somewhere between 8000 and 12000 words, over 100000 characters.\n\nSOLR seems to handle this fine given enough RAM, but it can take somewhere from 5 to 30 minutes to complete, depending on the contents and specified filters.\n\nFrom a usability perspective it would be really cool if we could get some kind of progress update on this from SOLR, so that you can make an estimate of the remaining time. % finished or something like that.\n\nWould this be at all possible? I don't know exactly what's taking the bulk of the time and if that process is a process where it is known how many iterations are required, for example.",
