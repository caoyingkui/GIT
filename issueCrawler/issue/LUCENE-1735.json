    "description": "If you reopen() and IndexReader with a custom setting for TermInfosIndexDivisor, the new segments will not get the old setting for TermInfosIndexDivisor set on the IndexReader opened with IndexReader.open()\n\nFurthermore, if you call setTermInfosIndexDivisor() on the reopend index, you will likely encounter a IllegalStateException (if any segments were retained from previous index) because the old segments will have already been loaded (and will now throw an exception when trying to set the value)\n\nSuggest that either the value be propagated to newly opened segments on reopen, or DirectoryReader ignore IllegalStateException from segment readers on setTermInfosIndexDivisor()",
