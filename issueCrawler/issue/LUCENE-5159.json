    "description": "Sorted/SortedSet give you ordinal(s) per document, but them separately have a \"term dictionary\" of all the values.\n\nYou can do a few operations on these:\n\n\tord -> term lookup (e.g. retrieving facet labels)\n\tterm -> ord lookup (reverse lookup: e.g. fieldcacherangefilter)\n\tget a term enumerator (e.g. merging, ordinalmap construction)\n\n\n\nThe current implementation for diskdv was the simplest thing that can possibly work: under the hood it just makes a binary DV for these (treating ordinals as document ids). When the terms are fixed length, you can address a term directly with multiplication. When they are variable length though, we have to store a packed ints structure in RAM.\n\nThis variable length case is overkill and chews up a lot of RAM if you have many unique values. It also chews up a lot of disk since all the values are just concatenated (no sharing).",

The current patch specializes the termsenum and reverselookup for this case (but again, im sure there are bugs, its hairy) ",
