    "description": "I fixed the failure in TestNRTThreads, but in the process tripped an assert because SegmentReader.doCommit isn't sync'd.\n\nSo I sync'd it, but I don't think the norms APIs need to be sync'd \u2013 we populate norms up front and then never change them.  Un-sync'ing them is important so that in the NRT case calling IW.commit doesn't block searches trying to pull norms.\n\nAlso some small code refactoring.",
