Spatial uses error correction if you use GeoHashUtils#decode. It calculates a precision values and rounds the result accordingly. If you use  GeoHashUtils#decode_exactly  the result looks much better though if you expect the result to be very very precise.\n\ndon't know if this is a huge issue. I could change the implementation to ignore decode and encode precision maybe that makes our impl closer to the one on google code. Again don't know if that is really an issue. \nThe lat values 52.3738007 and 52.373799999999996 are very very close so I guess you won't even realize it on a map.\n\nsimon ",
