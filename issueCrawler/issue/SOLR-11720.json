In this case I have several quesitons:\n1> did you issue a commit after the restore was complete? \n2> Do you have excessive autowarming set up? If your autowarming takes a long time, then the restore is fine. The old searcher was serving requests until autowarming finished.\n3> how long is \"eventually\"? Seconds? Minutes? Hours? Details matter.\n4> are you absolutely sure you weren't getting hits from a non-Solr cache (browser, something between and Solr etc.)?\n\nBest,\nErick\n ",
