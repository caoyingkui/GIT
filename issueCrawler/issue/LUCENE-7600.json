            "content": "Here is a patch that splits DocIdMerger into two impls. One other thing it does is that in the sorted case, it advances all subs but one so that we do not need the if (first == false) condition in next(). Moving the cost from next() to reset() sounds like a good trade-off to me since the latter is called much less frequently than the former (that said I don't think it will have any perf impact). ",
