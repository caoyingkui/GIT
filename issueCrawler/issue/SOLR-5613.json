I wasn't too surprised by this.  I think we can accommodate this request easily.\n\nJust for giggles, I went even further and upgraded all commons.apache.org components to the newest versions I could find via ivy.  All tests still passed.  This was on a Windows 8 machine.  With so many upgrades, I was really surprised it passed.\n\n\nIndex: lucene/ivy-versions.properties\n===================================================================\n--- lucene/ivy-versions.properties      (revision 1555313)\n+++ lucene/ivy-versions.properties      (working copy)\n@@ -19,16 +19,16 @@\n /com.ibm.icu/icu4j = 52.1\n /com.spatial4j/spatial4j = 0.3\n /com.sun.jersey/jersey-core = 1.16\n-/commons-beanutils/commons-beanutils = 1.7.0\n+/commons-beanutils/commons-beanutils = 1.9.0\n /commons-cli/commons-cli = 1.2\n-/commons-codec/commons-codec = 1.7\n+/commons-codec/commons-codec = 1.9\n /commons-collections/commons-collections = 3.2.1\n-/commons-configuration/commons-configuration = 1.6\n-/commons-digester/commons-digester = 2.0\n-/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload = 1.2.1\n-/commons-io/commons-io = 2.1\n+/commons-configuration/commons-configuration = 1.10\n+/commons-digester/commons-digester = 2.1\n+/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload = 1.3\n+/commons-io/commons-io = 2.4\n /commons-lang/commons-lang = 2.6\n-/commons-logging/commons-logging = 1.1.1\n+/commons-logging/commons-logging = 1.1.3\n /de.l3s.boilerpipe/boilerpipe = 1.1.0\n /dom4j/dom4j = 1.6.1\n /edu.ucar/netcdf = 4.2-min\n\n\n\nI'm not advocating that we upgrade all the components at once, but it looks like we can indeed upgrade them all eventually.
