    "description": "To both encourage good internal development, and to make it easy for plugin developers to write unit tests of their own code I think we need a harness that makes it easy to unit test updates and queries against Solr (without needing a servlet container)\n\nOnce we have this, i think we can/should also retire \"TestApp\" in favor of some JUnit tests (which would probably make more sense for other developers)\n\n\nIv'e already started on this, i thought i'd have something to commit tonight, but i got distracted ... filing this bug as a tracker for now.",

Even without that, this code can be commited as is \u2013 tests will just have to share a solrconfig.xml for the time being, but they can use unique schema files.\n\n\n\nThe only hitch with all of this, is that i seem to have a filehandle leak somewhere.  Or at least i think i do ... running \"ant legacyTest\" works fine with an openfiles limit of 1024, but \"ant junit\" runs out of filehandles using the same limit (at 2048 the test runs fine).  The index itself only contains about 100 files when this happens so i'm not sure what's going on.\n\nIf anyone can help me spot the problem, i'd appreciate it.\n\nI'm going to take a look at it with some fresh eyes (and lsof) in the morning.
