    "description": "Currently to test a codec (or set of codecs) you have to add them to lucene's core and edit a couple of arrays here and there...\n\nIt would be nice if when using the test-framework you could instead specify a codecprovider by classname (possibly containing your own set of huper-duper codecs).\n\nFor example I made the following little codecprovider in contrib:\n\npublic class AppendingCodecProvider extends CodecProvider {\n  public AppendingCodecProvider() {\n    register(new AppendingCodec());\n    register(new SimpleTextCodec());\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThen, I'm able to run tests with 'ant -lib build/contrib/misc/lucene-misc-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar test-core -Dtests.codecprovider=org.apache.lucene.index.codecs.appending.AppendingCodecProvider', and it always picks from my set of  codecs (in this case Appending and SimpleText), and I can set -Dtests.codec=Appending if i want to set just one.",
