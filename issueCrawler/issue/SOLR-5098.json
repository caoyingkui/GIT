            "content": "Here is a first cut at support for adding new field types to managed schema. Two things of interest here:\n\n1) There's a whole bunch of proven code for creating a fieldType using the FieldTypePluginLoader so I chose to use that for this solution. However, it requires the fieldType to be defined in XML, hence this patch uses an \"adapter\" to transform the JSON from the REST API request to XML, see: FieldTypeXmlAdapter (only around 100 lines of shim code)\n\n2) The endpoint doesn't support adding multiple field types in a single request as is allowed for fields. Personally, I think client apps should have to add one field type at a time, but if we want to allow multiple that shouldn't be too bad to add. "

            "content": "Tim, looks great - I did a quick review and noticed a few things:\n\n\n\tManagedIndexSchema, the addFieldType(), addFieldTypes() and newFieldType() methods should extend (no-op) methods in IndexSchema, like the addField(), addFields() and newField() methods do.\n\tMulti-term analyzers aren't handled in ManagedIndexSchema.addFieldTypes() - you have to cast to TextField to access this analyzer if it's defined.\n\tIt's a little weird that FieldTypeCollectionResource.addOrUpdateFieldTypes() calls FieldTypeResource.addNewFieldTypes() - that piece of code is fairly small, converting addNewFieldTypes() to specialized non-statics might be better?\n\tFieldTypeCollectionResource should implement POSTable, and FieldTypeResource should implement PUTable.\n\tThe licence text in TestManagedSchemaFieldTypeResource is a copy-paste of the one in TestFieldTypeResource, where I added spaces where they don't belong on the last line: \"limit     ations\".\n\tIn addition to testing creation of field types, TestManagedSchemaFieldTypeResource should also test creating fields using newly created field types.\n\tTestCloudManagedSchemaConcurrent should be modified to include some field type additions; this class will need some love every time we add new functionality to the schema API.\n\n "
