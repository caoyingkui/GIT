Perhaps mention on top of CHANGES.TXT\n\nAdd normalization/folding\nFor all the Norwegian field types, consider adding ScandinavianNormalizationFilterFactory to normalize ae->\u00e6, \u00e4->\u00e6 etc. This is a light normalization which would be beneficial to most if not all users. \n\nAlternatively, add commented example",
