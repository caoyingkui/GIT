    "description": "I like the idea of the http caching features in 1.3 but I don't want it to use ETags.  At least the lastModified headers are based off of a searcher open time but the ETags don't use this and will cause cached results to occur when I do things like restart the server (because I want to pick up changes in my new solrconfig file that affect query responses).",

It seems to me that last-mod alone is just fine.  I like that the last-mod can be based off of the indexreader open time; that seems ideal to me. "
