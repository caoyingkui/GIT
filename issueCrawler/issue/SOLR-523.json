    "description": "When I change the version number of the solr schema from 1.0 or 1.1 to something arbitrary like say 0.8.1 - solr reports a parsing error with the schema - however, a version number \"0.8\" is accepted.  It would be nice if solr reporting an \"invalid schema version\" error instead or atleast put something in the log that has a bit more detail.\n\nYou could add in a check in src/java/org/apache/solr/schema/IndexSchema.java that might look like this:\n\n    Node node = (Node) xpath.evaluate(\"/schema/@version\", document, XPathConstants.NODE);\n    if (!(\"1.0\".equals(node) || \"1.1\".equals(node))) \n{\n        log.warning(\"invalid schema version - use 1.0 or 1.1 only\");\n    }\n\nIt's quite poor to hardcode the version numbers - but I thought I should include something to give you a more concrete idea of what I am talking about.",
