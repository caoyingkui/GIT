            "content": "FYI, I removed \"7.3\" as one of the FixVersions for this issue - 7.3 was released about a month ago, so it's impossible that this fix is in that specific release. I note that the commit was backported to branch_7_3, in which case the only possible 7.x release the fix could be in is 7.3.2 (since 7.3.1 was generated before this fix was put into the branch), if such a release even occurs.\n\nIn other words, the fixVersions should only be releases that haven't been released yet, except when you're retroactively adding the correct fixVersion for an issue that didn't get it assigned properly when it was fixed.\n\nThis also means that the entry in CHANGES.txt for this in branch_7_3 is incorrect, since this fix is not in the 7.3.1 that was just put up for a vote.
