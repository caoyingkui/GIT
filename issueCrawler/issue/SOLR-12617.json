    "description": "The\u00a0BeanUtils library is a dependency in the velocity contrib module.\n\nIt is a compile time dependency but the velocity code that Solr uses doesn't leverage any of this.\n\nAfter removing the dependency Solr compiles just fine and the browse handler also loads up correctly.\u00a0\n\nWhile chatting to Erik Hatcher offline he confirmed that the tests also pass without this dependency.\n\nThe main motivation behind this is a long standing CVE against bean-utils 1.8.3 ( https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0114#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle\u00a0) which to my knowledge cannot be leveraged from how we use it in Solr . But security scans still pick it up so if it's not being used we should simply remove it.",
