I would suggest to change the sentence that mentions clearAttributes() to be more clear, some ideas:\n\n\tevery Tokenizer must call clearAttributes (as we have already in the text)\n\tevery TokenFilter that inserts new tokens into the stream must also call clearAttributes(). Alternatively use captureState()/restoreState() to clone the previous token and modify it afterwards (this is the recommended way to insert tokens from TokenFilters).\n\n\n\nUwe ",
