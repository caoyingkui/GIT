    "description": "as triggered by SOLR-261, if you have a query like this...\n\n   +foo:BBB  +(yak:AAA  baz:CCC)\n\n...where the analyzer produces no tokens for the \"yak:AAA\" or \"baz:CCC\" portions of the query (posisbly because they are stop words) the resulting query produced by the QueryParser will be...\n\n  +foo:BBB +()\n\n...that is a BooleanQuery with two required clauses, one of which is an empty BooleanQuery with no clauses.\n\nthis does not appear to be \"good\" behavior.\n\nIn general, QueryParser should be smarter about what it does when parsing encountering parens whose contents result in an empty BooleanQuery \u2013 but what exactly it should do in the following situations...\n\n a)  +foo:BBB +()\n b)  +foo:BBB ()\n c)  +foo:BBB -()\n\n...is up for interpretation.  I would think situation (b) clearly lends itself to dropping the sub-BooleanQuery completely.  situation (c) may also lend itself to that solution, since semanticly it means \"don't allow a match on any queries in the empty set of queries\".  .... I have no idea what the \"right\" thing to do for situation (a) is.",

I'd like to think not. ",

            "content": "So an acceptable solution is:\n  Query parser will ignore empty clauses (e.g. ' ( ) ' ) resulted from words filtering, the same as it already does for single words. \n\nA straightforward fix is for QueryParser to avoid adding null (inner) queries into (outer) clauses sets. (It makes sense, too.)\n\nHowever this has a side effect: \n  For queries that became \"empty\" as result of filtering (stopping), QueryParser would now return null. \n\nThis is an API semantics change, because applications that used to get a BooleanQuery with 0 clauses as parse result, would now get a null query. \n\nHere is a closer look on the behavior change:\n\nOriginal behavior:\n   (1)  parse(\" \")  == ParseException\n   (2)  parse(\"( )\")  == ParseException\n   (3)  parse(\"stop\") == \" \"    \n        (actually a boolean query with 0 clauses)\n   (4)  parse(\"(stop)\")  == \" \"    \n        (actually a boolean query with 0 clauses)\n   (5)  parse(\"a stop b\") == \"a b\"\n   (6)  parse(\"a (stop) b\") == \"a () b\"   \n        (middle part is a boolean query with 0 clauses)\n   (7)  parse(\"a ((stop)) b\") == \"a () b\" \n        (again middle part is a boolean query with 0 clauses)\n\nModified behavior:   \n   (3)  parse(\"stop\") == null\n   (4)  parse(\"(stop)\")  == null    \n   (6)  parse(\"a (stop) b\") == \"a b\"   \n   (7)  parse(\"a ((stop)) b\") == \"a b\" \n\nI think the modified behavior is the right one - applications can test a query for being null and realize that it is a no-op. \n\nHowever backwards compatibility is important - would this change break existing applications with annoying new NPEs?\n\nAs an alternative, QueryParser parse() methods can be modified to return a phony empty BQ instead of returning null, for the sake of backwards compatibility.\n\nThoughts?
