    "description": "The PostingsHighlighter mechanism currently returns all fields specified in the hl.fl parameter for each document, even if they do not have hits within them. This can lead to a lot of empty / self-closing tags if highlighting on a large number of fields which may be undesirable.\n\nIt would be useful if a user could specify using a parameter such as 'hl.ignoreUnhighlightedFields=true' that these fields are not returned in the response.\n\nSee http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/PostingsHighlighter-returning-fields-which-don-t-match-td4084495.html for a suggestions on implementation.",
