So one could also simply create a TokenFilter and put it ontop of the Tokenizer to wrap? new TokenFilter(new WrappedTokenizer())  - why need a Tokenizer for that when TokenFilter is made for it?\n\nBut for completeness, this ctor should also get the Reader/CharStream (as all other ctors have the Reader param).

I think, this has historical reasons and to keep consistent we should add the ctors. Or deprecate all Reader ctors and state, that you should create a reusable Tokenizer and call reset(Reader).\n\nI am still not sure, why a simple TokenFilter does not serve the same pupose you would like to have with Tokenizer here. Why not simply wrap the Tokenizer with a TokenFilter that already has the possibility to delegate? If it is because you miss the reset(Reader) call, we could think about adding this to TokenFilter, that passes to the delegated Tokenizer (using instanceof checks). ",
