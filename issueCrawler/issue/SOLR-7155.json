            "content": "Patch.  Requires the patches from SOLR-7145 and SOLR-7151 to be applied first.\n\nThis just adds the capability to select a collection at query time to CloudSolrClient.  For HttpSolrClient it's a no-op, although that should be easy enough to add in a follow up issue.  I've also added better javadocs to SolrClient, and moved some methods that were only in HttpSolrClient up to the base class.\n\nAll tests pass. ",

The implementation of the new HttpSolrClient#request method completely ignores the collection parameter.  I can foresee situations where someone implements code using that method in HttpSolrServer and then wonders why it doesn't make requests to the core that they listed for the collection parameter. ",
