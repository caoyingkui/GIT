    "description": "Since we now have stats for points fields, it's easy to know up front whether the field you are about to build a BKD tree for is single valued or not.\n\nIf it is single valued, we can optimize space by not storing the ordinal to identify a point, since its docID also uniquely identifies it.\n\nThis saves 4 bytes per point, which for the 1D case is non-trivial (12 bytes down to 8 bytes per doc), and even for the 2D case is good reduction (16 bytes down to 12 bytes per doc).\n\nThis is an optimization ... I won't push it into 6.0.",
