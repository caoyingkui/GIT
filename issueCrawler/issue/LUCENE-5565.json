    "description": "The SpatialPrefixTree/Cell API supports bytes and String encoding/decoding dually.  I want to remove the String side to keep the API simpler.  Included in this issue, I'd like to make some small refactorings to reduce assumptions the filters make of the underlying encoding such that future encodings can work a in more different ways with less impact on the filters.\n\nString encode/decode will exist for the Geohash one for now since GeohashUtils works off of Strings, but Quad could change more easily.",

            "content": "The attached patch:\n\n\tremoves String based token of Cell & SpatialPrefixTree.  Geohash Cell still uses Strings though; Quad was improved to not.\n\trenamed getTokenBytes() to getTokenBytesNoLeaf(), plus added getTokenBytes() that will have a leaf if the leaf is set.\n\tinstead of using a boolean leaf flag; we examine the encoding\n\tCell is no longer Comparable (wasn't  needed)\n\tThe former inner class CellTokenStream is now its own class and modeled heavily off of NumericTokenStream.\n\n\n\nI'll do a performance test to ensure the performance is at least the same.

LUCENE-5608 won't make it into 4.8 so better to not see it partway done and get released.  In fact LUCENE-5608 shouldn't be backported to 4x until at least one new SPT uses the API, which may trigger some changes to the new API. ",
