As Chris put it in http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Duplicate-content-p18535995.html\n\nallowDups is one of those features where Solr not only gives you enough \nrope to hang yourself, but Solr also ties the rope into a knot, cust some \nlumber, and builds you a gallows \u2013 but it's a feature if what you really \nwant to do is hang yourself.\n\n\nYes \u2013 by default, if you send a document with the same uniqueKey, it will be overwritten.  If you turn off the duplicate detection, it will put the document into the index, but will likely explode down the line \u2013 many things assume the uniqueKey is in fact unique.\n\nNote \u2013 this patch does not remove the functionality from solr, it only removes the ability to ask for it via solrj\n "
