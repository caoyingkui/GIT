In contrast to Kuromoji, the JAR file is missing in the distribution (the analyzers-kuromoji is part of main solr distribution). We should also add an updated/new \"text_ko\" field in the default schema.\n\nSee also SOLR-12255 about the documentation.",

You can already use it, but you have to download the JAR file from Maven central and place it in your plugin or lib folder (it's too large for Zookeeper).\n\nIn addition, the documentation for the factories in Lucene is non-existent, you have no idea which properties are available.

If you add UNT to the list of POS tags and change line 35 of the UnknownDictionaryBuilder to:\n\n\nprivate static final String NGRAM_DICTIONARY_ENTRY = \"NGRAM,1801,3561,3668,SY,*,*,*,*,*,*,*\";\n\n\n\n... the build should work. We need this entry to annotate the ngrams that we add if the word is not recognized but the leftId, rightID for the SY POS tag has changed between 2.0.3 and 2.0.1. We could apply this switch automatically but can you explain why you need to use the old version of the dictionary instead of the new one ? ",

We also adjusted the leftid, rightid, and cost values to match our domain. So, if we change to the 2.0.3 dictionary, we have to recalibrate our adjusted values back to 2.0.3.\n\nSo we asked to use nori using 2.0.1 that we are using.\n\nAnd during the test, mecab-ko-dic-2.1.1-20180720 also caused the same error.\n\nLet's go through the guide again.\n\nThank you so much for your quick reply.
