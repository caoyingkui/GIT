    "description": "This is really confusing. I think MockRandomPF is mostly obselete, in that it writes a random seed file (.sd) so that its symmetrical when reading the index.\n\nthis is no longer necessary (codecs must write what they need). But i think it does some other cool things, like randomizes more params like skipintervals and so on.\n\nwe should make sure RandomCodec does all the evil things it does, delete MockRandomPostingsFormat, and rename RandomCodec to RandomPostingsFormat.\n\nThen add a real Random codec thats really a frankenstein and does things like switch up stored fields impl (LUCENE-4226) and so on.",
