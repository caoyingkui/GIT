    "description": "DirectoryTaxonomyReader uses the internal IndexReader in order to track its own reference counting. However, when you call refresh(), it reopens the internal IndexReader, and from that point, all previous reference counting gets lost (since the new IndexReader's refCount is 1).\n\nThe solution is to track reference counting in DTR itself. I wrote a simple unit test which exposes the bug (will be attached with the patch shortly).",

Also, added a test which covers that bug.\n\nOn the go, fixed close() to synchronize on this if the instance is not already closed. Otherwise, two threads that call close() concurrently might fail (one of them) in decRef().\n\nI think it's ready to commit, will wait until tomorrow for review. ",

This way we continue to delegate that logic to IR, and do not duplicate it.\n\t\tCurrent patch removes the ensureOpen() check from getRefCount(). I think this is correct - in fact I needed that when debugging this. Perhaps should document about it in CHANGES entry.\n\t\n\t\n\n ",

The code now is a nice way to only block threads which discover that TR is not already closed. I don't think it's that critical (how often do you call close() anyway), so I don't mind to keep it / make the entire method synchronized.\n\nWould it - again - be simpler to keep maintaining the ref-counts in the internal IR\n\nI think that the code would look odd \u2013 we'll ir.openIfChanged, then call incRef() until newIR.getRefCount() == oldIR.getRefCount(). And I'm not sure how will that play with someone calling concurrently to DTR.decRef() ... it might be a mess. Even though we duplicate ref counting logic, I think it's safer, but perhaps I misunderstood what you meant?\n\nPerhaps should document about it in CHANGES entry.\n\nI will mention it as well. ",
