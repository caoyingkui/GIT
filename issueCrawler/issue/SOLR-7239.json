    "description": "as mentioned in SOLR-6349, when i started doing perf testing of requesting individual stats, i noticed that min (and it turns out max) were slower to compute then more complex stats like sum & mean.\n\nWhile investigating, i realized that we can also optimize the case where a stats.field param is specified, but no stats are computed for example: stats.field=\n{!min=$doMin}\nfieldname&doMin=false",
