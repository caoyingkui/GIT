Can we not use the Similarity from IndexWriter for the case of NormsWriter?\n\nI think this is totally what we should try to do in trunk, especially after LUCENE-2846.\n\nIn this case, i want to fix the issue in a backwards-compatible way for lucene 3.x\nThe warning is a little crazy I know, really people shouldnt rely upon their encoder being used for fake norms.\nBut i think its fair to document the corner case, just because its not really fixable easily in 3.x\n\nFor trunk, here is what i suggest:\n\n\tLUCENE-2846: remove all uses of fake norms. We never fill fake norms anymore at all, once we fix this issue. If you have a non-atomic reader with two segments, and one has no norms, then the whole norms[] should be null. this is consistent with omitTF. So, for example MultiNorms would never create fake\nnorms.\n\tLUCENE-2854: Mike is working on some issues i think where BooleanQuery uses this static or some other silliness with Similarity, i think we can clean that up there.\n\tfinally at this point, I would like to remove Similarity.getDefault/setDefault alltogether. I would prefer instead that IndexSearcher has a single 'DefaultSimilarity' that is the default value if you don't provide one, and likewise with IndexWriterConfig.\n\n ",
