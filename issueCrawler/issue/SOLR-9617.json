    "description": "RemoteFileField extends from ExternalFileField. The purpose of this field type extension is to download an external file from a remote location (e.g. S3 or artifactory) to a local location to be used as an external file field. URLs are maintained as a ManagedResource and can be PUT as a fieldName -> url mapping. Additionally there is a RequestHandler that will redownload all RemoteFileFields. This request handler also distributes the request to all live nodes in the cluster. The RequestHandler also implements SolrCoreAware and will redownload all files when callad (i.e. whenever a core is loaded).",
