    "description": "While trying to update this ref guide page...\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Uploading+Structured+Data+Store+Data+with+the+Data+Import+Handler\n\nI encountered a bunch of problems when running bin/solr -e dih:\n\n\n\tevery collection in example/example-DIH/solr started getting _rest_managed* and _schema_analysis* files created in it\n\t\n\t\teither we should commit these empty files into the example, or pair down the schema's in these collections not to use these fieldTypes\n\t\n\t\n\ta server/example-DIH directory got created containing some hsqldb logs & properties\n\tat least 2 of the full import commands don't seem to work\n\t\n\t\tthe DB probably isn't working because the path to the hsqldb may not be correct anymore - hence the problem above as well (JDBC probably relative to CWD at the moment? need sys prop to be relative to solr home?)\n\t\tthe tika import doesn't seem to work either - probably another relative path problem\n\t\n\t\n\tthe example/example-DIH/README.txt file still needs updated to refer to bin/solr -e dih",

The easiest would be to just commit the _rest_managed.json files but I'd like to see if there's a clean way to just make the RestManager initialize lazily the first time it's invoked, which will mean any cores that don't need it will never have this file created.
