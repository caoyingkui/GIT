JIRA is used to report errors against Lucene/Solr itself. Also, it is important to provide a Solr product version.\n\nHowever, from the quick look at the exception, it seems that you have a MoreLikeThis component activated that has a numeric field configured as part of its similarity field list. When  the search term is textual (and not numeric) and Solr tries to expand the query against the numeric field, this causes an exception. I would check the specific query issued to Solr, look at the definition of the request handler it is issued against (in solrconfig.xml) and check the MLT field list configuration and the types of those fields.\n ",
