    "description": "The old Confluence Ref Guide had a draft version of basic docs on JSON facets, but it never made its way into the published guides. During the conversion of the Ref Guide from Confluence, I made sure the page was exported and converted to .adoc format.\n\nThe doc was never updated after any of the changes that have been made to JSON facet functionality since it was originally written, so it's possibly inaccurate or just out of date. Someone could take a crack at finishing the conversion cleanup and updating it with latest information so someday it can be part of the published Guide.",

The situation is even tricker since debug=query isn't propagated to slaves in the distributed search. The option I've found is debug=timing, which works like a charm but lacks of cluelessness. Should we put as just as \nIf you want to see what your merged/parsed JSON looks like, you can turn on debugging (debug=timing), and it will come back under the \"json\" key along with the other debugging information.     \nOr also mention such caveat/explanations as well (which might be good for SEO reasons, btw).\nNote: that debug=true as well as debugQuery=true might have enormous impact on request time, and debug=true is ignored for json.facet.
