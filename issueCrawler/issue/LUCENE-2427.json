    "description": "(Please note that the feature described in LUCENE-2425 is required reading for this issue.)\n\nHerein, we define a scheduled split rule that causes a split to occur in the split index to which it applies, at regular time periods, with or without an initial delay. In essence, this allows the arrangement of sub-indices in a split index to be re-organized at fixed-rate intervals.",
