    "description": "Function Queries like the 'max' function will cast its result to a float value even if the source value cannot be converted to floating point without loosing precision.\n\nFor example, the max() function will convert dates to floats, and in the process we loose some precision (milliseconds). This is problematic if we want to sort afterwards since we do not have a millisecond precision anymore. I do not know if there is a work around short of creating a new set of query functions that would take longs / dates / etc... and return the corresponding type and name them 'long_max(), date_max() etc...'\n\nI believe it would be more intuitive if functions like max() would return the same type as what they got in their argument (assuming they are all of the same type). \n\nmax(date, date) should return a date\nmax(long, long) should return a long",
