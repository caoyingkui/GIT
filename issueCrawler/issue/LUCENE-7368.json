            "content": "Here is a patch. getValueForNormalization and normalize are gone. Instead, boost are passed to Weights and stats at construction time. It helps have more final fields and simplifies BoostQuery. The boost is now a simple multiplicative factor, it can't get normalized away by the query norm like it used to happen with ClassicSimilarity. "
