    "description": "I am working on a similar issue with Spans (LUCENE-6411).\n\nAssertingScorer is currently only used as a top-level wrapper, and it doesnt support asserting for asTwoPhaseIterator (wouldn't help at the moment, the way it is currently used).\n\nToday some good testing of this is done, but only when RandomApproximationQuery is explicitly used.\n\nI think we should add AssertingQuery that can wrap a query with asserts and we can then have checks everywhere in a complicated tree?",
