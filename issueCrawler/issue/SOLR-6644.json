    "description": "DataImportHandler with a JDBC data source opens one DB connection per entity, and then holds on to that DB connection with an open transaction after it's finished processing that entity ... right until the whole DataImportHandler operation is finished.\n\nSo this can mean dozens of DB connections tied up for hours, unnecessarily \u2014 with each connection staying in \"idle in transaction\" state, holding (in PostgreSQL) an AccessShareLock on each relation it has looked at. Not ideal for production operations, of course.\n\nHere are the connections from Solr to the DB when a large import has been running for a while:\n\n\n backend_start | xact_start | query_start |        state        | minutes idle \n---------------+------------+-------------+---------------------+--------------\n 20:03:20      | 20:03:20   | 20:03:21    | idle in transaction |           32\n 20:03:22      | 20:03:22   | 20:03:22    | idle in transaction |           32\n 20:03:22      | 20:03:22   | 20:03:22    | idle in transaction |           32\n 20:03:22      | 20:03:22   | 20:03:23    | idle in transaction |           32\n 20:03:21      | 20:03:21   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:21      | 20:03:21   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:22      | 20:03:22   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:22      | 20:03:22   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:22      | 20:03:22   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:16:37      | 20:16:37   | 20:16:38    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:21      | 20:03:21   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:21      | 20:03:21   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:21      | 20:03:21   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:16:36      | 20:16:36   | 20:16:37    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:03:20      | 20:03:20   | 20:16:35    | idle in transaction |           19\n 20:16:36      | 20:16:36   | 20:35:49    | idle in transaction |            0\n 20:16:36      | 20:16:36   | 20:35:49    | idle in transaction |            0\n 20:16:37      | 20:16:37   | 20:35:49    | idle in transaction |            0\n 20:16:35      | 20:16:35   | 20:35:41    | idle in transaction |            0\n 20:16:36      | 20:16:36   | 20:35:49    | idle in transaction |            0\n 20:16:37      | 20:16:37   | 20:35:49    | active              |            0\n\n\n\nMost of these haven't been touched for a long time, and will not be needed again (because DataImportHandler is done with that top-level entity). They should be released as soon as possible.\n\nNoticed in production in Solr 4.7.0, then reproduced in 4.10.1 (so probably also true of all versions inbetween).",
