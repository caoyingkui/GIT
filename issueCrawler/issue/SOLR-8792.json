    "description": "The documentation presented here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/ZooKeeper+Access+Control\ndetails the process of securing Solr content in ZooKeeper using ACLs. In the example usages, it is mentioned that access to zkcli can be restricted by adding credentials to the zkcli.sh script in addition to adding the appropriate classnames to solr.xml. With the scripts in zkcli.sh, another machine should not be able to read or write from the host ZK without the necessary credentials. At this time, machines are able to read/write from the host ZK with or without these credentials.",

It is not for the default ZK client, but only for a short lived client that is used to fetch the solr.xml from ZK (if present). I can see that the VM params based ACL provider is kicking in. \n\nHowever, in my efforts to have SolrCLI work, now I am dealing with another problem: SolrCLI doesn't get the ZK username/password passed in by the bin/solr script while creating collections, and hence collection creation is failing. Looking into that for now. ",

I'll investigate that separately.  Manually starting the individual nodes and creating a collection worked fine with bin\\solr.cmd.  Annoyingly, the environment variable set in zkcli.bat leaks into the dos box environment, so in order to test that it couldn't access ZK after Solr had set restricted ACLs on content, from the cmdline I had to first unset the environment variable used to specify ZK ACL and credentials provider classes, user names and passwords.\n\nCommitting shortly.
