The collection was created , index copied over but was in an unreadable state\u00a0\n\nWe should clean up all the state if a restore fails.",

Another approach would be to make sure if another restore happens for the same collection (a retry), it can continue where the previous one left off. I'm thinking this could be useful when restoring big collections, retrying would be faster than starting over. (I'm saying this without having looked at the code, just based on the title and description of this Jira) ",
