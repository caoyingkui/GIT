    "description": "Tika 1.0 has fixed a major issue with processing and parsing of PDF files that was splitting the words incorrectly: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-724\n\nThis causes text to be indexed incorrectly in solr and it becomes specially visible when using spellcheck features etc.  \n\nThey have added a special parameter set using setEnableAutoSpace that fixes the problem but there is currently no way of setting this when using Solr.  As discussed in thread on above issue, it would be nice if we could control this (and in future other) parameter via Solr configuration.",
