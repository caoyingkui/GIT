    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-3126. SegmentMerger.createCompoundFile does not document that it should not receive files that are not included in the .cfs, such as .del and .s* (separate norms). Today, that method is called from code which ensures that, but we should:\n\n\tAdd some documentation to clarify that.\n\tAdd some asserts so that if a test (or other code, running w/ -ea) does that, we catch it.\n\n\n\nWill post a patch soon",

While, generally, this may include separate norms and deletion files, this SegmentInfo must not reference such files when this method is called, because they are not allowed within a compound file.  Something like that...? ",
