    "description": "Working on a distrib test for another issue, i discovered that if you subclass AbstractFullDistribZkTestBase (and probably some of it's super classes) and specify config files that have mistakes/inconsistencies in them (or just flat out don't exist) you'll see the expected errors in the logs about being unable to initialize \"collection1\", but no actual test failure (until/unless you try to talk to the controlClient or cloudClient.\n\nIf the test base classes are going to require a schema & solrconfig and init collection1 as part of the setup (i'm not saying they should \u2013 but the existing ones currently do) then they should do some basic sanity checking that collection1 actually loads properly.",
