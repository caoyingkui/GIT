    "description": "The language-detection library we use is https://code.google.com/p/language-detection/ version 1.1 from 2012. The project has stalled with no new development, not even in the [github repo](https://github.com/shuyo/language-detection) the original author put up.\n\nLooks like the most promising fork is this one https://github.com/optimaize/language-detector/ which is also being selected by the Tika project to replace Tika's old detector.",

            "content": "...too many options will only confuse people, one implementation that does the job properly should be enough.\n\nI think Jan's point is that this issue should remain focused on updating LangDetectLanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor to use the more up to date fork of the library it's already using, because that hsould be fairly straight forward.\n\nWe already ship/support 2 implementations of LanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor, adding a 3rd based on langid-java (and or deprecating/removing either of the ones we have already) should be done as distinct issue(s) ... particularly since deciding which ones are the best will probably take more time/effort/consideration then just upgrading the langdetect lib.
