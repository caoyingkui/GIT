If i misspell something that genereate a result i get suggestions on it.\nIt should come up with proper suggestions even if there are no results to be displayed (But there is things that should be suggested).\nLong story short. Same functionality as in 3.5",

            "content": "I did looked a little at this and it seems that when \"group=true\", the first stage request doesn't reach all the shards.  For the case I was testing, with 2 shards, only 1 shard would get the request.  This would make the spellchecker work some of the time and fail others.  I haven't figured out for sure why this happens though.  Possibly the grouping logic short-circuits and doesn't bother requesting to shards that are known not to contain the groups that will be returned? "

            "content": "Here's a patch that changes SpellCheckComponent#modifyRequest to do its work when the request purpose is ShardRequest.PURPOSE_GET_TOP_GROUPS rather than ShardRequest.PURPOSE_GET_TOP_IDS when grouping is enabled.  On grouped requests, intra-shard requests with ShardRequest.PURPOSE_GET_TOP_IDS are only sent to shards that contain Top Groups, so SpellCheckComponent wouldn't have the opportunity to find all of its suggestions in a grouped scenario. \n\nThere is also a change to DistributedSpellCheckComponentTest to randomly enable grouping for each test scenario.  However, we still get failures related to the \"correctlySpelled\" flag and with the use of \"alternativeTermCount\".  So we still need to investigate why distributed vs non-dist return different results in these cases.\n\nThis patch I think is complete enough for evaluation purposes. "
