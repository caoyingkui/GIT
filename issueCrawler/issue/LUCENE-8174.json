    "description": "The following code produces an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IntRange intRange = new IntRange(\"foo\", new int[] { 1 }, new int[] { 2 });\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(intRange.toString());\n\nThe exception is thrown in NumericUtils.sortableBytesToInt, which is fed an incorrect offset.\n\nThe bug appears to be in IntRange.toString. I guess the for loop should read\n\nfor (int d=0; d<type.pointDimensionCount()/2; ++d)\n\ninstead of\n\nfor (int d=1; d<type.pointDimensionCount(); ++d)\n\nbecause the number of dimensions is half the number of \"point dimensions\" (cf. the checks on the dimension parameter in getMin() and getMax()).\n\nThe same bug is found in the DoubleRange, FloatRange, and LongRange classes.",
