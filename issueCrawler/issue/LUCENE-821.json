No clone is needed since\nonly a single norm is read at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\tclose norms when no longer needed (idea from Michael)\n\n\n\n\n\tremoved extra IndexInput clone() when reading the norms... why was this there originally?\n\n ",

It seems like a nice to have, but, since norms(...) is\nalready synchronized we could have a simple refcount to track how many\nNorm instances still required it and then close the stream when that\nhits 0?  This way we can free up 1 more file descriptor in certain\ncases. ",
