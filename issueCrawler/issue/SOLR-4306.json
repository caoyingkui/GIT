Solr tests do pass with this patch on branch_4x.\n\nThe little bit of poking around that I did in the UI on 4.2-SNAPSHOT did not turn up any noticeable problems.  I just fired up the example.  I will be able to try it on 4.1 with my multicore dev index tomorrow.\n\nIf I did do it right, or the right way can be done quickly, it would be preferable to get this into the 4.1 release. "
