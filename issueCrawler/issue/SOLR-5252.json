            "content": "Currently, core.properties is moved to core.properties.unloaded on an UNLOAD command.\n\nI may be wrong, but i vaguely remember a discussion about wether or not core.properties should support an \"enable=true|false\" property, and the decision ultimately being \"no \u2013 if people want to disable a core they should delete / rename the properties file\"\n\nI suspect that is why you are seeing the rename.\n\nI would suggest that this decision be re-thunk: it would be better if enable=false in core.properties was supported and treated as if the core.properties did not exist on startup, but would allow the file to be reused (with enable=true automatically replaced with enable=true) on explicit CREATE actions.\n\n\n\twould help fix this bug: the UNLOAD code could leave the file was left in place, with enable=false added to it.  subsequent CREATE command would parse it,  add/change any explicit params set on CREATE and write it back out.\n\tit would allow people an easy way to say \"here is a core dir that i don't want loaded by default on startup, but if it does get loaded via CREATE here are some props to use unless the CREATE command overrides them.\n\n\n "
