When I try to use pf parameter with query parameter defined like this: q=(aaa bbb)+OR+field\"aaa bbb\")^100 the pf parametr is not working - with debug turned on i see some strange phrase query as a part of lucene raw query. Of course when I set the query parametr to something like: q=(aaa bbb) without the 'OR' part the phrase boost is working perfectly.",
