            "content": "Thanks Marius Grama but this is patch isn't quite right. The DocCollection#write method is used to persist the collection information to ZK but we don't want znodeVersion to be persisted to ZK as part of the collection. It is best to add the znodeVersion manually to the collection information being returned by the cluster status API. Look at OverseerCollectionProcessor#getClusterStatus where this is all done. Also, all tests for this API are in TestCollectionAPI so I'd appreciate if you can add a test for this new feature as well. ",
