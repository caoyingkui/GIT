    "description": "Patch forthcoming that adds a DocValuesStats object that is optionally computer for a ValueSourceQuery.  This ~replaces the getMin/Max/Avg from the DocValues which were previously unaccessible without reasonably heavy subclassing.  in addition it add a few more stats and provides a single object to encapsulate all statistics going forward.  The stats object is tied to the ValueSourceQuery so that the values can be cached without having to maintain the full set of DocValues.  Test and javadocs included.\n\n\n\twill",
