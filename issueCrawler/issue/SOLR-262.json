Add to SolrInputDocument\n  public void setKeepDuplicateFieldValues( String name, boolean v )\n\nThis decides if the field value colleciton should be backed by a Set or List.  To keep the API simple, I'm using LinkedHashSet for everything rather than adding another option to keep distinct values where order does not matter. "
