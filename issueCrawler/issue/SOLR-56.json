    "description": "This patch adds a \"json.wrf\" parameter to add a wrapper function around the JSON results, for example:\n\n  json.wrf = eatJason\n  search result = eatJason({\"header\":\n{\"qtime\":0}\n,...}))\n\nThe result set is sent as a parameter to eatJason instead of being sent as a plain data structure.\n\nThis is useful to work around the cross-site limitations of JSON, when a client uses code like\n\n  var head = document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0];\n  script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.id = 'uploadScript';\n  script.type = 'text/javascript';\n  script.src = \"http://mysolrserver/solr/select?q=role:video&wt=json&json.wrf=eatJason\";\n  head.appendChild(script)\n\n  function eatJason(obj)\n{\n     ...process obj which is Solr's JSON result\n  }\n \t\t\t\t\n\nHowever, I'm no javascript expert, and passing an arbitrary javascript function name in the request parameters feels a bit weird...wondering if this might enable some cross-site scripting scenarios?\n\nBut the technique is well-known apparently, see:\n  http://www.theurer.cc/blog/2005/12/15/web-services-json-dump-your-proxy/\nand \n  http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/12/21/json-dynamic-script-tag.html",

On the other hand, wrapper function is more descriptive about what it does to the actual response.  I'm undecided...\n "
