            "content": "Here is a patch:\n\n\tIt adds a trackTotalHits parameter to the TopFieldCollector factory methods\n\ttotalHits is approximated when collection is early-terminated\n\tEarlyTerminatingSortingCollector is removed (or rather moved to Solr which used this class in a way that made it hard to cut over to TopFieldCollector)\n\n\n\nIndexSearcher still always performs a full collection for now. My goal here was just to make early termination easier to use. We might be able to simplify/improve based on the output of the discussion at LUCENE-8060 but I feel like this change is already a step in the right direction. In particular it is now easier to use early termination with pagination. ",
