    "description": "Similar to SimpleGeoJSONPolygonParser for creating Polygon objects from GeoJSON, it would be helpful to have a SimpleWKTParser for creating lucene geometries from WKT. Not only is this useful for simple tests, but also helps for benchmarking from real world data (e.g., PlanetOSM).",
