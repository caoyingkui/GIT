    "description": "recently I found that  RAMDirectory(Directory dir, boolean closeDir)  constructor uses memory inefficiently.\nfiles from source index are read entirely intro memory as single byte array which is after all is thrown away. And if I want to load my 200M optimized, compound format index to memory for faster search I should give JVM at least 400Mb memory limit. For larger indexes this can be an issue.\n\nI've attached patch how to solve this problem.",

I do not see any reason to make the buffersize configurable from outside. The tests i made with different sizes didn't show any difference on performace or disk usage. The new implementation would be similar to BufferedIndexOutput where the internal buffer size couldn't be changed either. Do i miss something ? ",
