            "content": "Patch for trunk:\n\n\tMakes getSequentialSubReaders() protected\n\tConverts all tests to use leaves() when dealing with DirectoryReaders - stupid casting is gone!\n\tFacet code used getSequentialSubreaders very often including summing up docBases. This is not needed, the code now uses AtomicReaderContext and its docBase -> much cleaner code, easier to read\n\n\n\nProblems:\n\n\tFieldCacheSanityChecker previously looked into subreaders using getSequentialSubReaders, which did not throw AlreadyClosedException. But getTopReaderContext() throws this exception (which is important to prevent readers from being used by searchers when closed), so the sanity checker can no longer visit closed readers - which it should not do in my opinion.\n\n ",
