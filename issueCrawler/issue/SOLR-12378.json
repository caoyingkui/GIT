The proposal here is to have an option to allow the existing docs to be missing this field and to simply treat those docs as older than anything coming in with that field set.",

Actually that typo existed in an older version of the file, which my original patch was based on (and I had actually fixed that typo too!) but I clearly messed something up when I rebased on the latest** master.\nCan you please update your patch for master? \u00a0This file was recently split in two.\n**Obviously not latest enough.\n\nSorry about that.\u00a0Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez L\u00f6bbe actually mentioned to me a couple days ago that the files had changed but I didn't get a chance to fix it yet.
