            "content": "My thoughts:\n\nHdfsDirectoryFactory.java\n+    Integer value = params.getInt(name, defaultValue);\n\n\nWhen calling getConfig, for a boolean the precedence is param value, system value, passed default. For strings it is the same order. For ints, it looks like it is param value, passed default, and then system value. Should be consistent with the other two. The problem is on this line.\n\nHDFSTestUtil.java\n+      Timer timer = new Timer();\n\n\nProbably outside of the scope of this issue, but using a Timer is sometimes unsafe. Since all Timer objects share a thread, delays or issues in one Timer execution can propogate to other executions (Java Concurrency In Practice, p123). We should consider replacing with a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor. A follow-on issue is fine for this, I expcet the actual impact to be minimal.\n\nHdfsDirectoryFactoryTest.java\n+  public void testInitArgsOrSysPropConfig() throws Exception {\n\n\nThis test covers a lot of ground, it would be nice to see it broken down into several smaller tests - one for each scenario that you're trying to do, I think. Not sure if the testing framework is easily amenable to that, however.\n\n\n+  public static class MockCoreDescriptor extends CoreDescriptor {\n\n\nDoes this enable something that EasyMock does not?\n\n\n+++ solr/core/src/test/org/apache/solr/util/MockSolrResourceLoader.java\t(revision 0)\n\n\nThis class looks unused.
