Even if some people thought it was clear that it was a path so you could use . for the root context, I don't think most people associate . and .. with URL's the same way they do with files. I and at least one other did not anyway \n\nIt's a great workaround though.\n "

I'd change the default to /, but it's a back compat issue I'd rather not deal with. So it seems the best method is document a token for this - and \".\" seems as good as any.
