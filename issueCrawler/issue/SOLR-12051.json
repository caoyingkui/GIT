    "description": "After SOLR-12011 get committed, we can lead into the case when no active replicas are qualified to become the leader. The only 2 solutions for users in this case are\n\n\tUsing FORCE_LEADER API\n\tBring back the old leader\n\n\n\nThis ticket will introduce a leader election timeout so current active replicas can ignore the lost updates and go ahead to become the leader. I think it will be better and not confuse users by reusing leaderVoteWait (the current usage of leaderVoteWait for waiting replicas come up before leader election is no longer needed)",

I like the new tests.\n\n\n\tPlease add javadocs for the new waitForEligibleBecomeLeaderAfterTimeout and replicasWithHigherTermParticipated methods to make it clear what the boolean return values mean\n\tThe default value of leaderVoteWait remains unchanged (i.e. 3 minutes) in this patch? Is that intentional?\n\n\n\nI think this patch should go to 7.3 because without it SOLR-12011 is incomplete. Let's get it in and have jenkins start chewing on the tests. ",
