I don't know if it's critical though that there's a method call - is that what bothers you? ",

So best keep the patch as is. ",

At any rate, the reason we check the size is for throwing a friendlier exception with text. If someone passes an invalid ordinal, he'll get AIOOBE anyway, just without the text.\n\nI'll commit this now. ",
