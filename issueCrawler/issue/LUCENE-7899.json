    "description": "I don't think we have a query today to efficiently test whether a doc values field exists (has any value) for each document in the index?\n\nNow that we use iterators to access doc values, this should be an efficient query: we can return the DISI we get for the doc values.\n\nElasticSearch indexes its own field to record which field names occur in a document, so it's able to do \"exists\" for any field (not just doc values fields), but I think doc values fields we can just get \"for free\".\n\nI haven't started on this ... just wanted to open the issue first for discussion.",

I'm tempted to go with a shorted name, but at the same time I'd like to reserve name space so that we could also have a norms-based implementation so that we could also find documents that have a value for text fields.

I generally recommend the same strategy also to Solr users (they just have to do it manually). Index size is in most cases not a problem, as the term index is small and the posting list is highly compressed! ",
