    "description": "To provide an easy way to check if an DIH import process is completed (i.e., without having to implement a custom Solr EventListener), it should be possible to pass a callback url along a URL to a DIH request handler. \n\nIdeally, the callback should somehow indicate the import operation's result (successful / not successful). This would obviate an additional call of the request handler to get the import operation's result and statistics, respectively.",

            "content": "Just looking at this patch quickly, I see that UrlCallbackListener.java correctly implements the EventListener interface.  So if we included this in our distribution, users could just specify this for \"onImportEnd\" as shown on the old wiki page . \n\nIts not clear to me why the other 3 classes need modification.  Also, a unit test would be nice, but arguably a pain to write. "
