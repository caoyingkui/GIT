    "description": "PulsingCodec currently doesnt always reuse its enums, which could lead to behavior like LUCENE-3515.\n\nThe problem is sometimes it returns the 'wrapped' enum, but other times it returns its 'pulsingenum' depending upon\nwhether terms are pulsed...\n\nwe can use the fact that these enums allow attributes to keep the reuse information for both so it can reuse when stepping through terms.",
