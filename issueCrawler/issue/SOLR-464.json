    "description": "The <copyField> directive works between certain dissimilar types, but does not work among other types. The directive works between 'sint' and 'integer' types.  However, copying a 'date' field to a 'String' field does not express the date as a string. The directive also fails silently.\n\nThe behaviour of <copyfield> between different types should be consistent. It should either always fail, or always succeed. If the policy is that it should fail in all cases, it should give an error on loading the schema, rather than failing silently.",

            "content": "Certain type pairs require configuration control parameters.\n\nThe most complex example is converting a Date to an integer for sorting purposes. Dates are 64 bits.  To get a usable sorting value requires subtracting a base date, earlier than any date used in the index. This gives a relative number that fits inside 32 bits and sorts correctly.\n\n "
