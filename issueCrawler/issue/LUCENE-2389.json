    "description": "As noted in LUCENE-1753 and other issues, TokenStream and Analyzers are based on the decorator pattern. At least all TokenStream and Analyzer implementations in Lucene and Solr should be final.\n\nThe attached patch adds an assertion to the ctors of both classes that does the corresponding checks:\n\n\tAnalyzers must be final or private classes or anonymous inner classes\n\tTokenStreams must be final or private classes or anonymous inner classes or have a final incrementToken()\n\n\n\nI will commit this after robert have fixed solr streams.",
