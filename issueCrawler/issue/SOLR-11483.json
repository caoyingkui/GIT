    "description": "We allow users to control the number of transaction log files the system should keep ( maxNumLogsToKeep ) and the number of records to keep ( numRecordsToKeep )\n\nHowever just by setting numRecordsToKeep we are not guaranteed that the system will actually keep that many records.  \n\nThis comment explains why - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-6359?focusedCommentId=15214361&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15214361\n\nA tradeoff would be if a user explicitly specifies  numRecordsToKeep and doesn't specify maxNumLogsToKeep then we should use a higher default for maxNumLogsToKeep ( say 1000 instead of 10 today )\n\nOff course better documentation will help so if others think this is a bad idea then we can close this out and just make sure it's documented and if users know about one parameter they will know about the other parameter as well",
