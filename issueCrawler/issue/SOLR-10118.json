    "description": "Comments in the example schema files of Solr about field\nrequirements for DocValues seem to be wrong. For example, in\nserver/solr/configsets/basic_configs/conf/managed-schema:\n\n\n     docValues: [...] they might\n        require the field to be single-valued, be required or have a default\n        value (check the documentation of the field type you're\ninterested in\n        for more information)\n\n     <!-- The StrField [...]\n        It supports doc values but in that case the field needs to be\n        single-valued and either required or have a default value.\n       -->\n\n   <!--\n     Default numeric field types. [...]\n\n     These fields support doc values, but they require the field to be\n     single-valued and either be required or have a default value.\n   -->\n\n\n\nI haven't found these limitations in the reference guide. It states that\nmulti-valued DocValues are stored as SORTED_SET. \n\nThe comments are probably outdated?\n\nIt seems the restrictions have been removed, e.g. with SOLR-4490 and https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/d208878c116bb66d6cb114ce51f69b7264ab668a#diff-ecbdc5fb2ccf861a92837e21fb37ace8",
