    "description": "I wanted to tackle this really in LUCENE-5969, but I found dragons here.\n\n\n\tthe handling of si.files() logic as it relates to compound files is inconsistent. For instance, flush passes trackingdirectorywrapper and has some logic, but merge/addindexes pass the raw directory and track things differently. Ideally we would just use trackingwrapper consistently, and remove CompoundFormat.files().\n\tmerge exception handling is scary: it manually snipes CFS files with indexfiledeleter when exceptions happen, which scares me a lot. I can also \"see things that look like bugs\" in this code. Maybe we can clean this up (especially if si.files is no longer crazy) and just somehow do a ifd.refresh(newseg) in all cases? Somewhat related is LUCENE-5987 but this would be a simpler step.\n\tthe timing around setting useCFS boolean is really awkward, e.g. the codec will see false when writing CFS files.",
