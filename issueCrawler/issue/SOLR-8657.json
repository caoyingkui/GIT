Also, from the screen shot you showed it says that the previous request is the commit request and the warming is happening on a different thread.\nI looked briefly at some tests that could hit this and they didn't, but I may be missing something. Maybe you can provide a test case? Maybe some modification in TestIndexSearcher? ",

Maybe this makes a difference.\n\nIn SolrCore.getSearcher(...) there is\n\n        if (currSearcher != null) {\n          future = searcherExecutor.submit(new Callable() {\n            @Override\n            public Object call() throws Exception {\n              try {\n                for (SolrEventListener listener : newSearcherListeners) {\n                  listener.newSearcher(newSearcher, currSearcher);\n                }\n              } catch (Throwable e) {\n                SolrException.log(log, null, e);\n                if (e instanceof Error) {\n                  throw (Error) e;\n                }\n              }\n              return null;\n            }\n          });\n        }\n\n\n which calls MDCAwareThreadPoolExecutor.execute().\n\nAnd in MDCAwareThreadPoolExecutor.execute() there is \n\nfor (int i = 0; i < providersCopy.size(); i++) providersCopy.get(i).set(ctx.get(i));\n\n with SolrRequestInfo.getInheritableThreadLocalProvider() being contained in providersCopy.
