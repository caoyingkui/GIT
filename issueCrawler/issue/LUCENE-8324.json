    "description": "This has the side-effect that flushed segments that are 100% hard deleted are also\ncleaned up right after they are flushed, previously these segments were sticking\naround for a while until they got picked for a merge or received another delete.\n\nSince LUCENE-8253, a fully deleted segment is dropped immediately when it's flushed, however, its files might be kept around even after a commit. In other words, we may have unreferenced files which are retained by Deleter.\n\nI am not entirely sure if we should fix this but it's nice to have a consistent content between current files and commit points as before.\n\nI attached a failed test for this.\n\n/cc Simon Willnauer",

Flush (not commit) the second segment - this segment should be dropped\n 4. Commit\n\nI think we should release files of the dropped segment in either step 3 or step 4. ",
