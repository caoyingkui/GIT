What I meant by that is the newer trie based fields are the only ones you can get milliseconds from (regardless of precision) as opposed to a date string.  It's not practical to convert date strings to milliseconds/seconds on the fly from the fieldcache.  Perhaps we should throw an exception rather than silently using ord for those string-date fields though? "
