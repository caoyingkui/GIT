    "description": "Solr works on the lucene trunk, but uses a lot of deprecated APIs.\nAdditionally two factories are missing, the Keyword and StemmerOverride filters.\nThe code can be improved with 3.x's generics support, removing casts, etc.\nFinally there is some code duplication with lucene, and some cleanup (such as deprecating factories for stuff thats deprecated in trunk).",
