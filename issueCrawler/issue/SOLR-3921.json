            "content": "This patch works around the problem by returning 0 when the directory doesn't exist. Note that ReplicationHandler has the same issue.\n\nSeems that the proper way to handle this would be to move the size calculation into SolrCore class and use Directory instead of local filesystem. I'm not sure what that entails, this patch is a workaround where proper fix would require a more involved solution. Should I enter a jira for that? (ie move the calculation into solrcore and use Directory instead of local filesystem).\n\nI looked at adding unit tests for this however it wasn't clear how I might do that. I don't see that this is currently tested, and there didn't seem to be a way to use EasyMock for this. If there are any suggestions on how to add unit tests for this please comment. (if you feel such is necessary)\n\nI manually verified by using a RAMDirectoryFactory and then deleting the data directory after the server was started (the directory would be re-created on solr server startup). The UI functions properly with this patch - although the reported size is incorrect (zero). The Directory based approach I mentioned earlier would be necessary to address this. "

It's probably better to focus on getting the correct info from there then adding special cases for returning 0/null here. "

Agree with the getting correct info comment, if Mark wants to roll this into SOLR-3911 I'm good with that. I'd be happy to try providing a DirectoryFactory based fix if he doesn't. "
