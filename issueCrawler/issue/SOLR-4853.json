    "description": "While trying to use SolrJettyTestBase to build some unit tests for my project I ran into an NPE:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.apache.solr.util.ExternalPaths.determineSourceHome(ExternalPaths.java:50)\n        at org.apache.solr.util.ExternalPaths.<clinit>(ExternalPaths.java:28)\n        at org.apache.solr.SolrJettyTestBase.<clinit>(SolrJettyTestBase.java:53)\n        at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)\n        at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:266)\n        at com.carrotsearch.randomizedtesting.RandomizedRunner$1.run(RandomizedRunner.java:486)\n\n\n\nApparently some changes to SolrJettyTestBase's https support caused it to require the keystore that's distributed with the Solr examples.  Specifically the TEST_KEYSTORE static variable triggers a search for SOURCE_HOME in ExternalPaths which throws an NPE if the folder isn't found.\n\nAccording to Steve Molloy this used to work in Solr 4.1 and Chris Hostetter confirmed that this is a bug.  Ludovic Boutros also reported this in SOLR-4394.",

            "content": "Thanks for opening this John,\n\nI don't remember seeing Ludovic's comment in SOLR-4394 after that issue was resolved, but even looking at it now i couldn't understand how my change caused a problem in that code since: a) i didn't modify anything in ExternalPaths; b) SolrJettyTestBase already had a compile time dependency on ExternalPaths.  It's only because of your stack trace that i was able to understand his comment about overriding getSolrHome() and how my change introducing TEST_KEYSTORE introduced a problem for people subclassing SolrjettyTestBase in their external tests.\n\nI'm attaching a patch that i think resolves this issue.  SolrJettyTestBase now skips the SSL randomization logic (instead of a hard fail) if the example configs can't be found, and i also tried to improve ExternalPaths.SOURCE_HOME (and determineSourceHome()) have cleaner behavior in the event that they get used inadvertently by a client test.\n\nI experimenting with this changes in a little one off external test i created and it seemed to work, but i'd appreciate feedback from an end user who got burned by this bug to e sure it really resolves things for you.
