    "description": "Highlighting is complex. There are three highlighters, they have some common and unique options, and highlighting has some weird interplay with the schema. Getting highlighting right is maybe the most frustrating exercise in Solr app development.\n\nIt would be great to have a \"highlighting tester\", where you could pick a fieldType, input some text as a document and highlight a query. The purpose would be debugging a highlighting parameter set, and then grabbing that for your app. The UI would have all of the known options for the different highlighters, and show you the parameters. \n\nWe don't want to actually index the document. This page would require a 'highlighting analyzer update processor' which takes document text and runs against it. It would be a sibling class to the DocumentAnalysis, FieldAnalysis etc. handlers.",
