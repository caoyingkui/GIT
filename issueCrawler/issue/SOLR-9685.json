            "content": "Thanks Mikhail, I like the syntax!\n\nomitting leading # is illegal and causes exception\n\nNot really... valid queries are also of the form \n{ \"query_type\" : \"query_val }\n, so the \"#\" disambiguates between a query type and a tag.  For example, \"join\" would cause a join query to be parsed, while \"#join\" would mean a tag.\n\nLeading # is kept in the tag name.\n\nThat will cause confusion for people switching between multiple styles of tagging.  We already have established uses of tags without hashes in them:\n\nfq={!tag=color}item_color:blue\n\n\nAlso, we already have a way to add multiple tags via comma separation:\n\nfq={!tag=color,item_description}item_color:blue\n\n\nSo the JSON equivalent should be: \n\n{ \"#color,item_description\" : \"item_color:blue\" }\n\n ",
