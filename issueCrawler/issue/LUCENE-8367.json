    "description": "Today, when you index a FacetField with path foo/bar, we index two drill down terms onto the document: foo and foo/bar.\n\nBut I suspect\u00a0some users (like me!) don't need to drilldown just on foo (effectively \"find all documents that have any value for this facet dimension\"), so I added an option to FacetsConfig to let you specify per-dimension whether you need to drill down (defaults to true, matching current behavior).\n\nI also added hashCode and equals to the LongRange and DoubleRange classes in facets module, and improved CheckIndex a bit to print the total %deletions across the index.",
