    "description": "Original bug description indicated that when using Solr with embedded ZK everything was fine, but with an external ZK you'd get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\nCrux of the problem is some bad assumptions about any ZK node containing data \u2013 the ZookeeperInfoServlet powering the tree view of the Cloud Admin UI assumed that any data would be utf8 text.\n\nIf you are using extenral ZK, and other systems are writing data into ZK, then you are more likely to see this problem, because those other systems might be writing binary data in to ZK nodes \u2013 if you are using ZK embedded in solr, or using solr with it's own private (external) ZK instance, then you would only see this problem if you explicitly put binary files into solr configs and upconfig them into ZK.\n\n\n\nOne workarround for people encountering this problem when using Solr with a ZK instance shared by other tools is to make sure you use a \"chroot\" patch when pointing Solr at ZK, so that it won't know about any other paths in your ZK tree that might have binary data...\n\nhttps://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrCloud#Zookeeper_chroot\n\nIf you are having this problem because you put binay files into your own config dir (ie: images for velocity or something like that) then there is no straight forward workarround.\n\nExample stack trace for this bug...\n\n\n43242 [qtp965223859-14] WARN  org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler /solr/zookeeper\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 213\n        at org.apache.lucene.util.UnicodeUtil.UTF8toUTF16(UnicodeUtil.java:620)\n        at org.apache.lucene.util.BytesRef.utf8ToString(BytesRef.java:168)\n        at org.apache.solr.servlet.ZookeeperInfoServlet$ZKPrinter.printTree(ZookeeperInfoServlet.java:303)\n        at org.apache.solr.servlet.ZookeeperInfoServlet$ZKPrinter.printTree(ZookeeperInfoServlet.java:339)\n        at org.apache.solr.servlet.ZookeeperInfoServlet$ZKPrinter.printTree(ZookeeperInfoServlet.java:339)\n...\norg.apache.solr.servlet.ZookeeperInfoServlet$ZKPrinter.print(ZookeeperInfoServlet.java:228)\n        at org.apache.solr.servlet.ZookeeperInfoServlet.doGet(ZookeeperInfoServlet.java:106)",

            "content": "This has popped up on the mailing list again recently, so i took a look...\n\nAs Shikhar noted, the particular exception is happening in a bit of dead code which is easy enough to remove \u2013 but that's only part of hte problem.\n\nthe dead code is part of the tree walk of every ZK node that happens anytime you load the tree view page at all \u2013 so having any non utf8 files anywhere in your ZK tree is going to cause that exception as soon as you try to look at the Solr ZK UI \u2013 to reproduce just copy favicon.ico into your collection1/conf dir for example.\n\nbut even if we purge that dead code, a similar bit of logic exists in the function for fetching the details about a node if someone clicks on it.\n\nLooking through the history of the file, it seems like this problem was introduced back in r1298010 when the code was switched to use BytesRef \u2013 the existing logic to hex escape anything that wasn't in unicode wasn't preserved  \u2013 but from what i can tell, i don't think that ever worked (catching UnsupportedEncodingException from \"new String(byte[],String)\" doesn't seem right there according to the docs) and i'm not sure what use that would be anyway.\n\nIn the attached patch, i purged the dead code, added some error handling around the remaining attempt to serialize the \"data\" of any node the user clicks on, and in the event that the data can't be converted to String add a new \"dataNote\" property explaining why \"data\" is empty (even though dataLengh is non zero)\n\nIf no one sees any problems with this, i'll commit ASAP ... if we want to revist adding teh hex encoding output of bin conent we should probably hash that out in a new issue as an improvement, since i'm not convinced it's a good idea to just blindly do that in the same \"data\" field of the response ... could confuse people.
