It's a long time since these discussions and also a long time since the 3.6 deprecation of these schema features.\n\nWhat is the sentiment now, in particular from Hoss Man and Yonik Seeley? The code handling defaultOperator or defaultSearchField in schema will go away in 7.0, and we'll fail-fast if we encounter these from 6.6 (silently ignoring would be worse than failing).\n\nPersonally I haven't used these for years. But the main reason I started working on this is that it feels good to actually remove deprecated stuff and simplify the code, config and complexity of the product. But I don't have a problem either with just leaving it in there forever, as seemed to be what some of you (strongly) wanted way back then. If I get serious, well-founded push-back now, I'll unassign myself and leave the fate of this change in the hands of David Smiley  ",
