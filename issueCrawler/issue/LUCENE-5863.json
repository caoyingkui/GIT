It's also not that heavy: loads the URL from apache.org, runs 2 BWC tests, and then checks that the versions it saw are the same ...\n\nI agree it's somewhat redundant with the one-time version check plus ongoing check for each release, but I think having some redundancy here is actually really important (who tests the test testers!).\n\nBut separately I agree we should also have tests to confirm there is a version constant for every still-supported release.

It would be really nice in the future if we had something dynamic (it could be entirely out of the source tree: don't care), that generates indexes with old versions that aren't the same each time and tests them with the current version (at least checkindex, verifying it \"works\" too would also be nice).
