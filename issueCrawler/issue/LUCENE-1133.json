    "description": "It would be nice if the WikipediaTokenizer had a way of, via a flag, leaving categories, links, etc. as single tokens (or at least some parts of them)\n\nThus, if we came across [[Category:My Big Idea]] there would be a way of outputting, as a single token \"My Big Idea\".  \n\nOptionally, it would be good to output both \"My Big Idea\" and the individual tokens as well.\n\nI am not sure of how to do this in JFlex, so any insight would be appreciated.",

Tokens only (the current functionality)\n2. Untokenized only\n3. Both\n\nIn case 2, a Set of Wiki types is passed in, and any token that has that type will not be tokenized.  Case 3 is the combination of 1 and 2, with the untokenized token output first.\n\nSee the unit test for how it should work.\n\nI will commit after the release, pending improvements, etc. ",
