That's because previously we always returned BS2, which used NonMatchingScorer internally, and now we return null. Therefore this looks like a back-compat issue, but not sure how serious it is. The reason is that BooleanWeight.scorer() already returns null today in some situations, therefore any code that calls BooleanWeight.scorer() directly should already check that it didn't get null. So I'm not sure if it's indeed back-compat problem or not.\n\nWhat do you think? ",

And more than that, we don't have unit tests that cover these cases (I believe there are some that cover a null Scorer, but not a null DISI). And I wonder how this hasn't come up until now. I mean, the examples Mike gave above do not sound way too extreme to me.\n\nSo does this mean we should document that scorer cannot be null? And if so, we make NonMatchingScorer public and recommend to return it if the query does not expect to return any documents? We can also make NMS not instantiable (is it a word?), with a static instance() method, but that's a minor thing.\n\nOr ... we leave everything as-is, and add some test cases which test this exactly, and change QueryWrapperFilter to return NMS in case the scorer returned by Weight is null.\n\nI think I prefer the first approach.

QueryWrapperFilter will do that if the Query produced a null Scorer, which is legal, or at least the de facto impl of some Queries.\n\nI think that the decisions on this issue were made because we observed that returning null \"already exists\", and moving to not return null, or saying that null should not be returned, may break back-compat (e.g. if someone relies on null to mean \"there are no docs to match\").
