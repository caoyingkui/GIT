    "description": "Solr throws a \"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Map size must not be negative exception\" when using the PHP Serialized response writer with sharded queries. \nTo reproduce the issue start your preferred example and try the following query:\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=*:*&wt=phps&shards=localhost:8983/solr,localhost:8983/solr\n\nIt is caused by the JSONWriter implementation of writeSolrDocumentList and writeSolrDocument. Overriding this two methods in the PHPSerializedResponseWriter to handle the SolrDocument size seems to solve the issue.\nAttached my patch made against trunk rev 1055588.\n\ncheers,\nAntonio",

I've fixed it but I need to upload a third version of the patch (so please, sorry the mess) and a new test file.\nIn detail, to fix the issue I've added a numeric index to the \"response\" array of documents in writeSolrDocumentList as requested by the php serialization protocol and handled the field count in writeSolrDocument.
