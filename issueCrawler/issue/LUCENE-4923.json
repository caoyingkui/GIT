    "description": "LUCENE-4571 added a MinShouldMatchScorer: capable of using advance() on subscorers for minShouldMatch > 1. \n\nHowever, we didn't yet cleanup the (now dead) minShouldMatch logic from DisjunctionSumScorer: which is now only used for pure disjunctions. This can also give some reasonable performance improvements for in-order collection.",

Just cleaning house on the minShouldMatch gives about a 10% improvement on luceneutil, but supporting pure disjunctions as a top-level scorer from BooleanWeight is even better (20%):\n\n\n                    Task   QPS trunk      StdDev   QPS patch      StdDev                Pct diff\n              OrHighHigh       22.70      (6.5%)       27.45      (4.0%)   20.9% (   9% -   33%)\n               OrHighMed       31.17      (6.7%)       38.06      (4.6%)   22.1% (  10% -   35%)\n               OrHighLow       71.52      (7.1%)       87.48      (5.5%)   22.3% (   9% -   37%)\n\n  ",
