It seems this issue is simply here to sum up part of the work in SOLR-6533 in a vague sentence - fine if more was intended and then that changed, but then lets clean things up so it's easier for others to follow.

OTOH , if I am doing an extra commit to make some enhancements to the same issue , I can explicitly specify the enhancement\n\nI would say that the minimum message should include the issue summary (title).  When the issue number is the only thing in the message, most people will not remember what that issue is for, so if they want to know, they have to go look it up.  That might be hard to do in some circumstances ... for instance, you might be skimming email on a phone or other mobile device, or you might be reviewing \"svn log\" output.  If there's a meaningful message, I can decide immediately on reading the commit email whether I need/want to look at the issue for more detail.\n\nCommit messages are by developers, for developers ... so it's helpful to have a message that describes the commit and includes a little more detail.  Other summaries (like CHANGES.txt) are for users ... developer detail there tends to just cause confusion.\n\nI don't know if you know this ... but there is a commits@lucene.apache.org mailing list.  Each commit will result in at least one email (revision 1633340 was 19 messages, and I've seen larger ones), showing the revision number, commit message, and the full diff.  Unlike the Commit Bot messages that get added to the Jira issue, you cannot see any other details, like the issue summary.  I rely on the commits list more than the Jira updates for staying aware of code updates.  I use the messages in my Jira folder to stay informed of Jira discussions, and mostly skip over the Commit Bot messages, because they do not include the diff. ",
