    "description": "While the input sources are abstracted, the indices are always files in the \nFileSystem.  It would be nice to abstract the IndexWriter to output to other \ndata stores.\n\nFor example, I would like to trying to use Lucene to index and search a set of \nshort-lived documents while involved in a P2P environment.  Ideally, this \nindex (which would be single merge for each peer) can reside in memory rather \nthan in the file system (for reasons of security as much as anything else \u2013 \nI'd prefer not to require permission to write out to the user's filesystem).\n\nI think it'd be a nice addition to Lucene.  It would make the Lucene engine \nmore easily embedded into other apps.",
