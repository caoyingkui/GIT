If we did that, then the process could be entirely offline if release dates were taken from the local doap.rdf files instead of downloaded from JIRA.",

An extra release step will be required if we move it to the Git repo, so that the files will continue to be present on the website, similarly to how javadocs are now copied to the website.

Here's what I was going to do (but haven't really started #3 yet):\n\n\n\tDownload the doap.rdf files\n\tPut them in place in a cloned Lucene/Solr Git repo (probably at lucene/ and solr/).\n\tEdit these two files to contain the same dates as JIRA has - you can look at how current changes-to-html pulls release info from JIRA and do the same thing to get the raw data.  If there are conflicts, I think JIRA is probably more authoritative.\n\tFigure out how to parse the doap.rdf files, rather than the JIRA version output.  (I'm being vague because I haven't looked at details of what's involved here.)\n\tUse doap.rdf release dates rather than those from JIRA.\n\tStop downloading version data from JIRA.\n\n "

I double checked that this is a new problem by looking at http://lucene.apache.org/core/6_3_0/changes/Changes.html, which doesn't have this problem.  A nit: the 6.3.0 release date looks weird because the day-of-month is single digit (unlike all other dates, where it's zero-padded).\n\nOk, I added the versions from the jira json. However, the \"-final\", \"RCx\" and \"1.01b\" releases are not in any source. Is it ok to add them into the RDF as-is?\n\nBTW, the \"RCx\" releases were treated as if they were real releases at the time, more like -alpha, -beta, etc. than \"release candidate\" really.  The only thing I think worth considering here is whether the \"final\" modifier should be stripped in the doap.rdf files (even though it will remain in CHANGES.txt/Changes.html).  I could go either way.  I notice that JIRA lists \"1.9 final\" as just \"1.9\" - this is consistent with both the \"-alpha/-beta\" and \"-RCx\" naming schemes.  The distributions at http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/archive/ include the \"-final\" and \"-rcX\" suffixes in their names, though, so I'd prefer to continue naming these releases in the doap.rdf files the same way as they are named in CHANGES.txt (i.e., include \" final\" in their names).  This has the nice side-effect that no extra mapping step will be required in changes2html.pl. "

For pre-Apache releases this makes sense I think, but thereafter we should theoretically be able to identify the source branches.

E.g. Apache Maven uses this feature in its DOAP file: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven.git;a=blob_plain;f=doap_Maven.rdf;hb=HEAD.  However, projects.apache.org doesn't display this information right now (e.g. https://projects.apache.org/project.html?maven).\n\nI think it's ready.  I'll commit shortly. "

I noticed your comment because of the email sent to the dev list, but when I went to find it here I had to search for a while.  Please just make a new comment, and if you feel you need to include context, quote previous comment(s).  That way, future readers will be able to see comments properly time sequenced.  And synchronized interlocutors won't have to dig to find your comments; I've seen more than one occasion where people assumed that the latest comments were at the bottom, and so they missed replies that were placed elsewhere on the page.  I really really wish we could turn this feature off. "
