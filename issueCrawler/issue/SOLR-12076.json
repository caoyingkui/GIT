    "description": "All the CDCR tests simply print everything stored in ZooKeeper when we start the servers.\u00a0\n\nIt adds no value in my option and simply generates noise.\n\nIn general we should remove\u00a0printLayoutToStdOut\u00a0 which prints everything and pass a parameter to print only a particular set of znodes which they care about. For example if the leader election tests fail print\u00a0everything related to that collection and not print everything including the configs.\n\nIt's also a public API so I don't want to tackle this in the interest of time. I plan on specifically tackling the usage in CDCR tests and removing them. SOLR-6090 is also related for reference.",
