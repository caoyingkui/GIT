    "description": "The DisMaxQParserPlugin has a variety of nice features; chief among them is that is uses the DisjunctionMaxQueryParser.  However it imposes limitations on the syntax.  \n\nI've enhanced the DisMax QParser plugin to use a pluggable query string re-writer (via subclass extension) instead of hard-coding the logic currently embedded within it (i.e. the escape nearly everything logic). Additionally, I've made this QParser have a notion of a \"simple\" syntax (the default) or non-simple in which case some of the logic in this QParser doesn't occur because it's irrelevant (phrase boosting and min-should-max in particular). As part of my work I significantly moved the code around to make it clearer and more extensible.  I also chose to rename it to suggest it's role as a parser for user queries.\n\nAttachment to follow...",

            "content": "If the use-case is unrestricted Lucene syntax w/ dismax then Enhanced Dismax is the way to go.  What I'm shooting for in this issue is a more extensible query parser.  E-Dismax is cool but it doesn't look particularly extensible.\n\nFor example, in an app I support, I use this patch to do several things:\n1. check if appears to be using fancy Lucene syntax and if so then treat as such.. but with dismax of course on non-fielded clauses via SOLR-756\n2. If one clause then rewrite query to:    clause clause^0.5       \u2013 i.e. search for clause and also include partial matches.  For a small index I have this is fine but I can use n-gram some day if I need to.\n3. If multiple clauses then rewrite query to:   clauseA clauseB clauseC clauseC*^0.5     (clauseC is last clause).\n\nWhat I'm hoping for is for Solr to offer better query parsing infrastructure so that I can implement my parsing needs by re-using/plugging into as much as already exists as possible.  Committing SOLR-756 is one step there... but then there's some useful capabilty in DismaxQParser like boost queries, boost functions, q.alt.    min-should-match is relatively re-usable since it stands alone.
