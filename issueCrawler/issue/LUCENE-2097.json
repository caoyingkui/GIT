    "description": "Spinoff of java-user thread titled \"searching while optimize\"...\n\nIf IndexWriter is in NRT mode (you've called getReader() at least\nonce), and CFS is enabled, then internally the writer pools readers.\nHowever, after a merge completes, it opens the reader against het\nnon-CFS segment files, and pools that.  It then builds the CFS file,\nas well, thus tying up the storage for that segment twice.\n\nFunctionally the bug is harmless (it's only a disk space issue).\nAlso, when the segment is merged, the disk space is released again\n(though the newly merged segment will also be double-tied-up).\n\nSimple workaround is to use non-CFS mode, or, don't use getReader.",
