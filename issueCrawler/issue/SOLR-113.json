If I understand correctly the exampledocs in Solr i.e /example/exampledocs is not compatible with solrb.. Maybe I am doing something wrong? if so please clarify and delete the issue.

(probably we should add a line in the README file i.e how to load the sample data) .. Very cool work.. I like the new flare logo  ..\n\nI am just curious what else do you have in mind for next weekend?  or  for flare .. \n\nRegards. "
