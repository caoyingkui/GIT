    "description": "Hi,\ni am just new to SOLR , i come from sql , would like to swicth to nosql/solr  (with raik 2 perhaps) ,\nall my app is designed for search in number like this \nwhere bob & 6 and foo & 1 and manymanyfields & 134 ,etc...\n\nI insist on the fact i have many fields..the logic is all input value are  numbers (1,2,4,8,16,etc) , all inputs are capped to 50 choices max by input , so its an app for search common interest between people , from sql the bitwise & was perfect because it avoid to put a ton of keywords string in a big post size... many bench in past was made and we designed application like this for performance reasons..\n\nAll is here , thats why its very powerfull to search with bitwise operator rather list of string..\nI just read all the doc and i didn't find reference, so i guess this option doesn't exist in SOLR ?! \n\nIf yes, can i say why and is there some chance to see this new feature comes nearly ?\n\nScuse my poor english i'm too french..\nAny help or advises are welcome,\ngui",
