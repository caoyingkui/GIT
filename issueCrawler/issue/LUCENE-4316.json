    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-4315.\n\nThis was my comment there:\n\nwe should consider Fields.getUniqueTermCount,\nwhich has a default implementation that sums across fields (preflex overrides).\n\nThis was necessary to have some way to access the segment-level unique term count for 3.x indexes,\nwhich do not actually know this information per-field and override this method to provide it.\n\nBut there is no need to have this on AtomicReader (I think its way too expert, just get the Fields\nand get it from there), and we can consider deprecating this in 4.x and removing it in trunk\nalltogether as then someone can just use the field-level statistics.",
