    "description": "This issue relates to the following one:\nReturn HTTP error on POST requests with no Content-Type\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-5517\n\nThe original consideration of the above is to make sure that incoming POST requests to SearchHandler have corresponding content-type specified. That is quite reasonable, however, the following lines in the patch cause to reject all POST requests with content stream data, which is not necessary to that issue:\n\n\nIndex: solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/component/SearchHandler.java\n===================================================================\n--- solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/component/SearchHandler.java\t(revision 1546817)\n+++ solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/component/SearchHandler.java\t(working copy)\n@@ -22,9 +22,11 @@\n import java.util.List;\n \n import org.apache.solr.common.SolrException;\n+import org.apache.solr.common.SolrException.ErrorCode;\n import org.apache.solr.common.params.CommonParams;\n import org.apache.solr.common.params.ModifiableSolrParams;\n import org.apache.solr.common.params.ShardParams;\n+import org.apache.solr.common.util.ContentStream;\n import org.apache.solr.core.CloseHook;\n import org.apache.solr.core.PluginInfo;\n import org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore;\n@@ -165,6 +167,10 @@\n   {\n     // int sleep = req.getParams().getInt(\"sleep\",0);\n     // if (sleep > 0) {log.error(\"SLEEPING for \" + sleep);  Thread.sleep(sleep);}\n+    if (req.getContentStreams() != null && req.getContentStreams().iterator().hasNext()) {\n+      throw new SolrException(ErrorCode.BAD_REQUEST, \"Search requests cannot accept content streams\");\n+    }\n+    \n     ResponseBuilder rb = new ResponseBuilder(req, rsp, components);\n     if (rb.requestInfo != null) {\n       rb.requestInfo.setResponseBuilder(rb);\n\n\n\nWe are using Solr 4.5.1 in our production services and considering to upgrade to 4.9/5.0 to support more features.

You can put the fixed, let's say, PostTolerantSearchHandler.java into your codebase and refer to this class from solrconfig.xml, it smells for sure, but should work with the new version! ",
