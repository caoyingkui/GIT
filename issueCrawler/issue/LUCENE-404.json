    "description": "file: MultipleTermPositions.java, line: 201, function: skipTo(int).\n\nThis refers to the source that can currently be downloaded from the lucene site,\nLucene v. 1.4.3.\n\nThe function peek() returns null (because top() also retruned null). There is no\ncheck for this, as far as I can understand. The function doc() is called on a\nnull-object, which results in a NullPointerException.\n\nI switched the specified line to this one:\n\nwhile(_termPositionsQueue.peek() != null && target >\n_termPositionsQueue.peek().doc())\n\nThis got rid of the crash for me.",
