We at Tailsweep as well want to that in for example our blogsearch.\n\nExample:\n\"You had 1345 hits on 244 blogs\"\n\nThe 244 part is not possible in SOLR today (correct me if I am wrong).

Faceting on the type field would give you that count, or doing a facet.query=type:blogs would give you just that count (for any arbitrary query).\n "

Perhaps facet.query (like you pointed out) can be used, I overlooked that.

If this already can be accomplished in SOLR, my bad. Please tell me how.\n\nTed: \nTrove have two licenses GPL and ASL. I can use the ASL version if it helps.
