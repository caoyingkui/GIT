It uses a simple boolean to keep track of whether or not the \"first\" (ie: outermost) Iterator has been encountered yet (which is only feasible because it's an anonymous inner class used for only one stream)\n\nThis patch causes all tests to pass \u2013 but that doesn't necessarily convince me that it's correct \u2013 i would definitely appreciate it if someone who has actually looked at the update codec code prior to today would review this.\n\n(Note: i did have to modify the document equality assertions to understand that since we will never have a Set in an unmarshaled doc it needs to convert the corrisponding Collection to a set in order for assertEquals to do a non-ordered comparison) "

Treating all collections as type ARR instead of just collection.\nMoreover we do not need to support Iterable.\n+1\n\nI'm confused \u2013 it seems like you are in favor of my patch, but you also say we do not need to support Iterable  ... Iterable (and Iterator) are already supported by the marshalling method w/o any errors or warnings, i didn't add that, all i did was make sure Iterable (and Iterator) would be supported on the unmarshalling side as well.\n\nIf it was never intended for the JavaBinCodec to support Iterator/Iterable except in the special case \"streaming\" situations like what JavaBinUpdateRequestCodec does then that's fine, but in that case we should change JavaBinCodec so it errors during marshalling \u2013 the client shouldn't be able to successfully serialize some data if the server is then going to complain that it's an incorrect format.
