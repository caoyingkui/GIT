            "content": "Here is a patch. It uses the relative error bound documented in formula 3.5 from Higham, Nicholas J. (1993), \"The accuracy of floating point summation\", SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, which is E = (n-1) * u if all values are positive, where n is the number of doubles that are summed up and u is the unit roundoff. This implies that two sums cannot differ by more than 2*E. ",

            "content": "For the record, we might be able to achieve a better bound since our doubles are actually floats in that case but I don't think it is necessary since the delta that is introduced by this error is generally cancelled by the float cast, and when not it would only increase the max score by 1 ulp.
