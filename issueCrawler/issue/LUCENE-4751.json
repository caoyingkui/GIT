We have used Lucene to build a public site search functionality.\nAll the IndexReader objects in there are closed appropriately except one that throws the following error and results in (too many files open) exception.\nThis brings the entire site down.\nThe lucene version we are using is lucene-core-2.9.2.jar\n\nAny idea what could cause this exception?\n\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentReader$Norm.decRef(SegmentReader.java:393)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentReader.doClose(SegmentReader.java:868)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.decRef(IndexReader.java:170)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.doClose(DirectoryReader.java:803)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.decRef(IndexReader.java:170)\n       at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.close(IndexReader.java:1302)\n       at search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:387)   // the close in this class does not execute",
