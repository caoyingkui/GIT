    "description": "SpanScorer.setFreqCurrentDoc has a bunch of assert statements, and they refer to this.toString().  I'm pretty confident the intention was for this to actually be spans.toString(), not \"this\" which is a SpanScorer that doesn't even have a custom toString.  It was probably correct once but after some refactoring of Spans got messed up, probably in LUCENE-6919 (Lucene 5.5).",
