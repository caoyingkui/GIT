            "content": "I ran into a similar problem, but it had nothing to do with the name of the field.\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: deltaQuery has no column to resolve to declared primary key pk='did'\n\nIn my dih-config.xml file I have this.  The idea is simply to return a guaranteed result very quickly, so that it can then execute the deltaImportQuery, which as it happens is identical to the main query for a full-import:\n\ndeltaQuery=\"SELECT MAX(did) FROM ${dataimporter.request.dataView}\"\n\nThe result just has a column called MAX(did), not did.  The following change made it work, because it has the right field name to match the primary key in your DIH config.\n\ndeltaQuery=\"SELECT MAX(did) AS did FROM ${dataimporter.request.dataView}\"\n\nHopefully your problem is similar and can be easily solved in this way, but if not, this issue will still be here.
