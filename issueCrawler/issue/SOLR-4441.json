    "description": "A common usage scenario for a developer is to fire up multiple SolrCloud nodes on his/her laptop.\n\nWhen doing this, the second instance of Solr has to include the -Djetty.port=1234 parameter.\n\nAlso, I believe since the embedded ZooKeeper's port defaults to SolrPort+1000, you also have to specify the -zkHost parameter, even though you're going to be using localhost.\n\nIf would be nice if Solr noticed that it was already running and would automatically pick a different port, maybe 10 down from the most recently used port.\n\nIt would also convenient if the embedded ZooKeeper could also figure this out, and look for zkmaster on some ports on localhost.\n\nI realize this is now how things would be deployed in production.  This is just to get developers up quickly.",
