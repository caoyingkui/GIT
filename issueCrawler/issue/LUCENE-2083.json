    "description": "Doing a small patch to make sure things don't break in a big\nway, we'll use RRWL replacing some of the global synchronized\nlocks in IndexWriter. \n\nWe'll read lock during operations that for example delete from a\nsegment, and gwrite lock when we're changing the main segment\ninfos collection (i.e. we're swapping in new segments after a\nmerge, or flushing a new segment). \n\nI want to implement this, see if any tests break. \n\nSpin off from LUCENE-2047.",

            "content": "This is looking hairy because sync on IW is used in so many\ndifferent ways (i.e. notifyAll, wait, editing properties,\nediting segments, etc), I'm afraid of the little unknown bugs\nthis patch could create. There's also the nagging issue of RRWL not\nsupporting in any good way, upgrading read locks to write locks.\nThough I'll finish up the patch, test, and watch it break. \n\nWe'd probably also need to migrate to using condition instead of\nnotifyAll etc. In fact, we'd probably need to remove\nsynchronized altogether in order to be complete, however I'm\ngrowing hesitant because the patch could leave the entire IW\nsubsystem with weird bugs that are hard to duplicate. I'm\ngrowing more inclined to move the async logic above IW into\nLUCENE-1313 so that the existing Lucene tests don't need to be\nrewritten, and we can gain what we're looking (i.e. better\nconcurrency for NRT) without too much retrofitting.
