The artifacts have been published and are available, but Maven Central's search doesn't show it yet. \nhttp://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.carrot2%7Ccarrot2%7C3.4.4%7Cpom\n\nif you add \"jdk15\" classifier to the main artefact you'll get the 1.5 version. Unfortunately this solve the issue of distribution because the 3.x line currently contains manually retrowoven 3.5.0 JAR (not in any maven repository) and we're not planning on releasing 1.5-compatible releases for this line at all... (because we depend on other 1.6-only libraries among other reasons).\n\nI think we'll have to stick to the current model for the 3.x line (keep the JAR in the repo). For 4.x we can move to a distro available via maven central. Can you live with this? "

Unfortunately, though, the Solr 3.4 release did not include the Solr-specific 1.5-compiled org.apache.solr:solr-carrot2-core:jar:3.4.0.  I have created an issue to address this problem: SOLR-2770.\n\nFor 4.x we can move to a distro available via maven central.\n\nThis is already true - the trunk carrot2-core dependency is on the official artifact in Maven central.\n\nCan you live with this?\n\nSure, works for me.
