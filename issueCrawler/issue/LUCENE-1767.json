            "content": "Jason, I would expect a sizeOf method to return the size of the bitset itself (what #size()) returns. Maybe you find another name for that method. I also think you can safely leave the constants out - once you leave those out this method is almost identical to #capacity / #size.\n\nI'm not sure if such a method would rather confuse users / developers. If we add it I would rather go for a very meaningful name like allocatedBytes.\n\nsimon ",
