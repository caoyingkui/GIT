    "description": "There are two questions:\n1. The tlog of one replica of shard1 is damaged by some reason. We are still looking for the reason. Please give some clue if you are familia with this problem.\n\n2. The error replica successed to recovery by fullcopy download index files from leader. Then I killed the instance and started it again, the recovery process still is fullcopy download. In my opinion, after the first time fullcopy recovery, the tlog should be fixed.

            "content": "the tlog should be fixed.\n\nCurrently, when you replicate, you get nothing in the tlog. Yonik has brought up perhaps doing a little trick on replication to populate the tlog a bit, but nothing has been started on that front. So once you replicate, unless some docs are then added, the next fail will require another replication.\n\nHowever, we may actually be able to take advantage of replication itself noticing that it doesn't need to do a full replicate. Currently, in SolrCloud we force a replication every time no matter what when we call replicate - now that std replication has had some bugs fixed and has better tests, we may not have to force that anymore - and so the next full replication would not actually move any files.

That explains why a fullcopy replication happens every time when we call replicate.\n\nBut why is there still error log about tlog after I restart the Solr server several times?(every time the shard's state changed from recovering to active on zookeeper)\n\nWhy is replication called every time when I restart the Solr server with bad tlog?\nWhen I restart another Solr server with healthy tlog, fullcopy replication is not called. Does the bad tlog cause the replication?\n "
