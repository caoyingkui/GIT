    "description": "While working on SOLR-12708 , Mano disccovered used the response parsing technique from CreateShardCmd\n\nfinal NamedList addResult = new NamedList();\ntry {\n  ocmh.addReplica(zkStateReader.getClusterState(), addReplicasProps, addResult, () -> {\n    Object addResultFailure = addResult.get(\"failure\");\n    if (addResultFailure != null) {\n      SimpleOrderedMap failure = (SimpleOrderedMap) results.get(\"failure\");\n      if (failure == null) {\n        failure = new SimpleOrderedMap();\n        results.add(\"failure\", failure);\n      }\n      failure.addAll((NamedList) addResultFailure);\n    } else {\n      SimpleOrderedMap success = (SimpleOrderedMap) results.get(\"success\");\n      if (success == null) {\n        success = new SimpleOrderedMap();\n        results.add(\"success\", success);\n      }\n      success.addAll((NamedList) addResult.get(\"success\"));\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis code works as the response can have either a failure or a success. But isn't it the same as doing this? \n\nocmh.addReplica(zkStateReader.getClusterState(), addReplicasProps, results, null);\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe I am missing the motication here . Cao Manh Dat WDYT? If the usage is needed then at-least I'd want to document the reason in the code for future refernece.",

The current code on master doesn't do that anymore, which is a little surprising - this was removed during refactoring in 4bcace571ee. I think this should should still be there, and it's still there on branch_7x. What do you think Shalin Shekhar Mangar? ",

Once Add Replica is able to create more than 1 replica at a time, there is no reason for create shard to assign nodes and call add replica one by one for each replica of that shard. Is there a reason why we should preserve the old behavior? ",
