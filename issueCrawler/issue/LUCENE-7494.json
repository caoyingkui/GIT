            "content": "+1.\n\nRelated conceptually is another idea I've had kicking around: Does Fields need to exist?  It seems like a pointless intermediary.  Why not have LeafReader.getTerms(fieldName) instead?  One loses the ability to get the count and iterate over indexed fields, but it's not clear what real use-cases are for that and such rare needs could figure that out with FieldInfos.  If it sounds reasonable to you all I'll file a separate issue. "

            "content": "Fields does seem a bit silly, being such a tiny wrapper class, and it would make things more consistent if you also just passed a field name to the IndexReader API.\n\nThough, we also return Fields from getTermVectors, since that's essentially a tiny single-document inverted index.  I'm not sure how we'd polish that usage away ... I guess we could just narrow it to a new (old!) TermVectors class. "
