Do you think you can give it a quick review? \n\nAll other DIH tests pass too, including Mikhail's new tests from SOLR-3011.\n\nIf all's good, I'd like to try and slip this into 3.6 as this is to fix a 3.6-only regression (feature is removed in Trunk).

If you want to force all segments to be merged\n             into one, you can specify this parameter yourself. NOTE: this can be very expensive operation and usually\n             does not make sense for delta-imports.\n\n\n\nOf course if you are seeing a lot of .dels after importing data, it sounds like you have\nsome kind of impedence mismatch (duplicate unique ids) in your source data...
