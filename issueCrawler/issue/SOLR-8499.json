    "description": "I'd like to add a statistic to the /admin/mbeans (SolrInfoMBeanHandler) results \u2013 the number of segments in the Lucene index.  I think it would be best to add it to the stats returned by SolrIndexSearcher.  Currently that info is available from /admin/luke (LukeRequestHandler), but I'm finding it very painful to add another client request to the code where I want to use this additional info.\n\nAs long as I'm fiddling, hasDeletions would be another addition that some people might find useful.",

            "content": "small tweaks to the existing implementation\n\nGood idea.  If I had known that there was a \"numDeletedDocs()\" I would have used it.  The same deleted calculation is used in LukeRequestHandler, I can update that too.  Creating the map with the proper initial size might make it more efficient.\n\nI put hasDeletions in because it's there in LukeRequestHandler and seemed like a good idea.  I suppose a check for \"deletedDocs > 0\" is just as effective as a check for hasDeletions.  Allocating less heap memory can be a good thing.\n\nNow that I'm taking a second look, I am considering adding curly braces and newlines to the \"if\" statement that is near the end of the additions to lst, purely for readability.  The code is perfectly valid as-is, but I find one-line if clauses to be easier to visually parse if they are fully formatted. ",
