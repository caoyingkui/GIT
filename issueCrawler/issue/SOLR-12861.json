            "content": "Patch, mostly rote duplicate of RAMDirectoryFactory and its tests.  Added a test that actually uses ByteBuffersDirectoryFactory in a solrconfig.xml and indexes/retrieves docs; RAMDirectoryFactory doesn't have a direct test like this, maybe because it is the default in many test configsets.\n\nNote that cutting over from RAMDirectory(Factory) to ByteBuffersDirectoryFactory is not included in this patch; I imagine this task will be handled as part of LUCENE-8474.  Instead, this issue is focussed on enabling end-user specification of ByteBuffersDirectory instead of RAMDirectory. ",
