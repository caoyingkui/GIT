    "description": "Hello,\n\nI'd like to contribute this language guesser to Lucene. \n\nIt contains language guessing interfaces and classes as well as trigram \nspecific classes and some language reference files I generated myself using the \ntrigram file generation utily in there. I included a unit test as well.\n\nI didn't do any extensive tests on guessing quality and performance but I would \ntend to think that they are both OK for a first pass.\n\nI thought about writing a custom Analyzer for this but realized that this \nwouldn't be the way to go and that probably the language decision should be \nleft to the developper, definitely when the Analyzer is used to tokenize a \nquery.\n\nHave fun,\n\nJean-Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Halleux",
