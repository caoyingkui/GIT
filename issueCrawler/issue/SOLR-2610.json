These are small pieces that need to be fixed before tackling larger problems in SolrCloud and this one seemed generally useful and simple enough by itself that I opened the issue without giving the bigger picture. Some of the other pieces are captured in SOLR-2595\n\nWhy are you deleting cores only to add them back again with the same config?\n\nHopefully SOLR-2595 will give you a better idea of what I was thinking. The use-case is to split and migrate pieces of an index and this issue will help in deleting the leftover temporary cores.\n\nDo you really think it's inconsistent to actually be able to delete something?\nThe inconsistency is to be able to delete a configuration file when there is no way to add it back but I'm not against the feature in general.\n\nDoes it really seem like a weird use case to say, I want to delete a SolrCore I no longer have an interest in?\nAbsolutely not. If you want that feature, that's fine. You don't need permissions to put up a patch and commit it \n\nLooks like a few people have an interest in this issue, so I'm not sure why you rammed it in so quickly.\n\nThe issue clearly talks about deleting index on unload and that's what it does. And I got a +1 from you and Jason on the topic of the issue (or at least, that's what I assumed).

If the patch is not what you intended, go ahead and reopen/extend the scope of the issue or open another issue. "

Both Jason and I liked the idea, but it just seemed like we where discussing some of the details and you committed kind of without warning. I'm not that concerned about it, just mentioning it.\n\nIf the patch is not what you intended, go ahead and reopen/extend the scope of the issue or open another issue.\n\nI think the patch is fine - I've tweaked a couple little things on the changes entry, but the patch itself looks good so far.

The idea behind it is to reload an existing core's index with updated configuration changes and swap it with the existing core without causing downtime. It seems like your use-case is handled well with the stock CREATE, SWAP and UNLOAD+deleteIndex?\n\nCREATE requires that the caller be aware of internal server filesystem structures.  For the typical use of CREATE, this is not really a problem, but if what you're trying to do is unload a core, delete its index, and then immediately recreate it with the same config, it would be very nice to not have to specify (or even know) the solr.xml configuration bits.\n\nIn this particular case, the person who writes the scripts is the same person who maintains the Solr infrastructure (me) ... but that might not always be the case.  Currently the build scripts don't know anything about the internal structure other than core names, and I'd like to keep it that way.\n\nAdding an option like deleteIndex to RELOAD seemed a logical way to handle this, since currently (1.4.1) I have to completely restart Solr when I wipe out an index directory.  If this is not a logical progression, I would argue that CoreAdmin needs an entirely new action.  Either way, if it's deemed desirable, it needs its own Jira issue.  I brought it up here because it's at least tangentially related. "
