    "description": "Today we do two hash lookups, where in most cases a single one is enough. E.g. SR.getNumericDocValues initializes the FieldInfo (first lookup in FieldInfos), however if that field was already initialized, we can simply check dvFields.get(). This can be improved in all getXXXDocValues as well as getDocsWithField.",

            "content": "I implemented it, many tests fail in CheckIndex on ClassCastException. So this is the current code:\n\n\nFieldInfo fi = getDVField(field, DocValuesType.BINARY);\nif (fi == null) {\n  return null;\n}\n\nMap<String,Object> dvFields = docValuesLocal.get();\nBinaryDocValues dvs = (BinaryDocValues) dvFields.get(field);\nif (dvs == null) {\n  // initialize\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nAnd I changed it so that the FieldInfo part is inside the if (lazily initialize). The reason for the ClassCastException is that if you previously asked for a NUMERIC field w/ same name, it got into the map, therefore the code happily tries to case it to a NumericDocValues, or BinaryDocValues and hits the exception.\n\nSo I'm not sure this optimization is right .. but also that it's worth complicating the code w/ e.g. instanceof checks?

            "content": "I've thought about it more ... I really don't see the two hash lookups as an inefficiency, especially considering that if you're pulling a DocValues, you probably going to iterate over docs' values which is way more expensive than a hash lookup. And the code is safe, as otherwise the test failures prove. I'll resolve as Won't Fix for now, if we want to revisit in the future, we can reopen. ",

It was part of the design to not make pulling a docvalues expensive, because otherwise it makes it too hard to use (it is the same thing we fixed for reusing fields in indexwriter). ",
