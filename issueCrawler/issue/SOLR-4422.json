    "description": "The SolrJ DocumentObjectBinder class does not retain order when reading in dynamic field values into a Map.  More specifically, the order in which the Map is populated by an application is different to the order in which the Map is repopulated by SolrJ.\n\n\n@Field(\"dynamic_field_values*\")\nprivate Map<String, Object> dynamicFieldValuesMap = new LinkedHashMap<String, Object>(16);\n\n\n\nI believe the following would address this issue.\n  \u2013  allValuesMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();\n  +  allValuesMap = new LinkedHashMap<String, Object>();\n\n\nOr, maybe the DocumentObjectBinder should directly populate the Map field directly if that field is not null.\n\n----------------\n\nI am pretty sure issue does NOT exist with dynamic field values in a List, as the SolrJ DocumentObjectBinder uses a List implementation that retains ordering \"new ArrayList();\".  So the following will retain ordering.\n\n@Field(\"dynamic_field_values_ss\")\nprivate List<String> dynamicFieldValues = new ArrayList<String>();",
