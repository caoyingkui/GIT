    "description": "Hello\n\n\nI have a question about index schemas.\n\n1) Can I do various analysis on one field?\nFor example, you can analyze the 'title' field with multiple tokenizers, and merge the analysis into a single field.\n\n2) You can collect multiple fields in one field using 'copyField' function. However, several fields have different data attributes (eg, category fields, text fields, etc.) _)\nAt this time, I would like to analyze each field differently.\n\nDo you have these features in version 7.5? Is there any kind of shortcut to do these similar functions?\n\nThank you for your advice.",
