    "description": "The pid file will allow snappuller to be run as fast as possible without overruns. Also it will recover from a last failed run should an older snappuller process no longer be running.  The same has already been done to snapinstaller in SOLR-990.  Overlapping snappuller could cause replication traffic to saturate the network if a large Solr index is being replicated to a large number of clients.",
