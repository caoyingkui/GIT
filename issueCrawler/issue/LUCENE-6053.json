Nikola Smolenski - do you think you could reorganize things a bit so isolate Cyrillic part and thus make the rest reusable? "

In fact, you could even use it for Slovene!\n\nI was thinking of making some sort of unified name for the analyzer, but decided against it mainly for two reasons:\n\n\n\tVarious dictionaries and tools would be different, and I believe dictionary name should match the language name.\n\n\n\n\n\tWe might lose \"political\" support or good will from institutions or people who would be willing to work on the dictionaries.\n\n\n\nIn short, if CPU cycles are the problem, it should be easy to make a separate Croatian analyzer, just by copying this one and removing all the Cyrillic branches. For Slovene language, also by removing \u0107 and \u0111, if that is necessary.\n\n(Macedonian doesn't use the same system, BTW.) "
