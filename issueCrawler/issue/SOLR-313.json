A simple use case may be putting language information in document metadata and stemming document fields according to language.",

This patch also adds a MultiLingualStemFilterFactory that reads language information from metadata and returns that language's SnowballFilter.\n\nTo pass extra information during indexing, one can add it like this:\n\n<doc>\n  <field ...\n   ...\n   <meta name=\"language\" content=\"German\"/>\n</doc>\n\nAnd to pass extra information during search time, one can add it like this:\n\nhttp://localhost:8993/solr/select?q=........&meta.language=German\n\nPrefix \"meta.\" is used to avoid conflicts with other query parameters.\n\nAlso attached is a sample document and schema for testing.
