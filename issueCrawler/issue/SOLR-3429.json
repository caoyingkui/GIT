    "description": "This is a new transformer for dih.\nI'm often asked to import a lot of fields, many of these fields are read only and sould not be searched.\nI found useful to gather them in a single json field, and returning them untouched to the client.\n\nThis patch provides a transformer that collects a list of db columns an writes out a json map that contains all of them.\n\nA regression test is included. \n\nA new dependency for jsonic has been added to dih, (already used by langid), I can use a different library if needed.",
