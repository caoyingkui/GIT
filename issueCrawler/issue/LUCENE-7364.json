    "description": "If a BooleanQuery meets certain criteria (only contains disjunctions, is likely to match large numbers of docs) then we use a BooleanScorer to score groups of 1024 docs at a time.  This allocates arrays of 1024 Bucket objects up-front.  On very small segments (for example, a MemoryIndex) this is very wasteful of memory, particularly if the query is large or deeply-nested.  We should avoid using a bulk scorer on these segments.",
