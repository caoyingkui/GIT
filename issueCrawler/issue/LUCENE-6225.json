    "description": "Here is a snippet from IndexInput's documentation:\n\n\nThe original instance must take care that cloned instances throw AlreadyClosedException when the original one is closed.\n\n\n\nBut concrete implementations don't throw this AlreadyClosedException (this would break the contract on Closeable). For example, see NIOFSDirectory:\n\n    public void close() throws IOException {\n      if (!isClone) {\n        channel.close();\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\nWhat trapped me was that the abstract class IndexInput overrides the default implementation of clone(), but doesn't do anything useful... I guess you could make it final and provide the tracking for cloned instances in this class rather than reimplementing it everywhere else (isCloned() would be a superclass method then too). Thoughts?",

            "content": "According to \"java.io.Closeable\" docs, closing should not throw exceptions because multiple closes are allowed (so if it implicitely closed by root object, an additional call to clone's close should not fail).\n\nThe comment means: If you access the cloned IndexInput after closing the original the \"readXXX\" methods will throw AlreadyClosedException. For clones. the close() method is a noop, that is intended. "
