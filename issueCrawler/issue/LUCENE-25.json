Included in the attached is the less \ndisruptive one I could think of. It is \"only\" breaking three tests in \nTestQueryParser.\n\nHowever for the long term, I think that we should think of what it means to \nparse an empty query (\"\") and what should be the expected result (null,\"\", \nexception, ...)\n\nHave fun,\n\nJean-Francois Halleux ",
