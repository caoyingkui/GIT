I've decoded it and included the changes in normal patch format.\n\nI don't use Netbeans, but to test this out I downloaded the Netbeans installer and installed it on OS X, and ran ant netbeans.  I was able to open the project and look at files, so it seems to be at least minimally functional.\n\nCommitting shortly.  ",

The branch named branch_4x (dev branch for 4.x versions) only requires Java 6.  There is a LOT of testing during normal development, and even more testing before each release, so there is a very high confidence level that the 4.x version does not have Java 7 code in it.\n\nThe BooleanPerceptronClassifier.java file doesn't exist in branch_4x at all, and with a quick glance, I didn't seem any problems in the 4x version of DocInverterPerField.java.\n\nIf you actually do find Java 7 constructs in branch_4x, that's a bug.  Feel free to file issues and submit patches for any such problems that you find in branch_4x.  If you want to check branch_4x out from SVN, use the following command:\n\n\nsvn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/branch_4x\n\n ",

Its code duplication and hard to maintain. I would keep the \"params\" the same like for Eclipse (means only one fileset with source files) and make the distribution to the different XML elements with additional checks on the path strings (if they end in src/test or src/resources). The sorting code can be streamlined to only one for-each loop which is reused (through an xsl:template). ",

When defining the variable, the usual XSLT v1.0 document-fragment / node-set hack is needed, but that is common to people who know XSL. This also improves speed of the XSL, as it is only sorted once. Also the classpath element is also created only once now and copied 2 times into the output document. ",
