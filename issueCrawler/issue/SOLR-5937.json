            "content": "Big +1.  I've wanted to do it myself, but tuits (especially the round kind) have been in short supply lately.  I get a grand idea, perhaps go as far as filing an issue, and then find I have no time to work on it.\n\nRelated but requires its own issue: I've been wondering if the multicore example is overkill.  It's certainly far out of date.  The DIH example illustrates multicore well.  We can include README.multicore or something like it in the example directory.\n\nSomething that's been in the back of my mind for discussion is adding 'collection2' to the standard example with the same config/schema as collection1.  I can't decide whether it's a good or bad idea. "

The changes I did here made it clear that the config required for the example DIH cores is very minor, and could maybe be stored as a small patch that 'ant example' applies after copying the main example over, or something similar.  The same could go for 'collection2', I guess? "
