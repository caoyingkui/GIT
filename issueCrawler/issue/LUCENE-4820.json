Though, we could do the same thing w/ the current approach ... eg break out the payload and let the app check it for accept / reject (somewhere there is a patch to expose accept method in AnalyzingSuggester...).\n\n\nIt might also be more efficient as a separate output, but I havent thought about all the cases there either.\nits like if payloads dont exist we could just use the empty string or whatever and there is really not much\nadded cost.\n\nYeah it could be.  Hmm, every arc would add a byte (mostly, sometimes more I guess if payload is longish), but if the payloads can be shared well, then the overall FST could be smaller ...\n\nI agree we should explore it!
