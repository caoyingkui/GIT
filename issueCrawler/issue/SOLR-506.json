    "description": "HTTP cache headers are needed only for select handler's response and it does not make much sense to enable it globally for all Solr responses.\n\nTherefore, enabling/disabling cache headers should be configurable on a per-handler basis. It should be enabled by default on the select request handler and disabled by default on all others. It should be possible to override these defaults through configuration as well as through API.",

By default, emitting http cache headers is disabled. Users who desire caching must enable this for the handler they want.\n\nThe example solrconfig.xml has emitting http caching enabled for the StandardRequestHandler, MoreLikeThisHandler and SpellCheckerRequestHandler. I've removed explicit setHttpCaching calls in SearchHandler, MoreLikeThisHandler and SpellCheckerRequestHandler. If a custom request handler explictly calls the SolrQueryResponse#setHttpCaching method then it will override the per-handler configuration in solrconfig.xml\n\nDo we need tests for this?\n\nsvn stat follows:\nM      src/test/test-files/solr/conf/solrconfig-nocache.xml\nM      src/test/test-files/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml\nM      src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/RequestHandlerBase.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/component/SearchHandler.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/SpellCheckerRequestHandler.java\nM      src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/MoreLikeThisHandler.java\nM      example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml "
