    "description": "org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos is public, and contains public methods (which is good for expert-level index manipulation tools such as Luke). However, SegmentInfo class has package visibility. This leads to a strange result that it's possible to read SegmentInfos, but it's not possible to access its details (SegmentInfos.info(int)) from a user application.\n\nThe solution is to make SegmentInfo class public.",

Is this really an API we want to support long-term?  If there are individual methods that we wish to expose, perhaps they can instead be exposed through IndexReader or IndexWriter.  It is a slippery slope to now start making things it references public.\n\nPerhaps we should in the future try to separate interfaces and implementations into separate packages.  The implementation package could be named something like 'index2impl' with the understanding that its public API will not be supported long-term.  But, until we do something like that, I think package-private works well.  Tools like Luke can add classes to the package in order to access package-private stuff. ",

I would volunteer to do the release mechanics since I\ncaused this (sorry) \n\nI will also review what else I made public, and, be more careful in\nthe future to not relax protection unless it's absolutely needed.

You were switching several such methods from public to package-private, which is a no-op and prompted my comment.  On the other-hand, if the class is ever made public, it may be useful to have its intended public API pre-declared, and, even if it's never made public, declaring some methods public has some documentation value.  In general, the style I prefer is try to declare fields and methods as though each class were public.  Package-private methods and fields are really only required for classes that actually are public but that wish to hide some things from all but others in their package.\n\nThis is a fine point, and doesn't warrant too much analysis.  I probably should have just held my tongue. ",
