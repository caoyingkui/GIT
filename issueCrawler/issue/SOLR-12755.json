    "description": "It would be desirable in a Solr Cloud configuration if a request like:\n\nupdate?optimize=true&distrib=false\n\nonly executed on the shard that received the request.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs is well known force merging is a very expensive/disk space hungry operation and hence this increased control should address the following issues:\n\nFree disk space requirements: 1-2x size of ALL shards on the machine vs 1-2x size of largest shard\n\nI/O: High disk contention when a machine holds multiple shards as all shards are being simultaneously rewritten\n\nAvailability: All replicas will simultaneously have impaired performance\n\n\u00a0\n\nRelevant previous issue: SOLR-6264",

It was my understanding that when you ask for an optimize, that SolrCloud will step through the shard replicas for that collection and optimize them one at a time until the entire collection is done.  Doing them simultaneously could cause serious I/O problems.\n\nYou are correct that distrib=false should restrict the optimize to one core, like it does for a query.  This has been brought up before.  See SOLR-10740. ",

            "content": "Yes I am seeing all shards being optimized simultaneously, and yes it does cause the I/O problems one would expect from doing that! It sounds like prior to SOLR-6264 it may have worked in the way you describe.\n\nI hadn't seen SOLR-10740, and I agree that this is basically a duplicate, but hopefully this issue spells out the problems with sending the optimize request to all replicas of every shard simultaneously.
