Sometimes it does, sometimes it is just blank and sometimes it's the previous file.\n\nAn awful lot of space is eaten up by the info on top like \"aversion\", \"ctime\" and the like, is this useful? Or could it be shrunk?\n\nRelated: If I select the collection then under that the \"files\" link this all seems to work fine. But, I cannot see my managed schema. I want to in order to see the fieldTypes I have available, or more accurately the analysis chains associated with them.",
