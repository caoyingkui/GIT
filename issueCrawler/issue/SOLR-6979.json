    "description": "It would be nice if we could be smarter about single valued fields versus multi-valued when dealing w/ data-driven mode.  For instance, we probably can assume single-valued until proven otherwise.  May be some cases where a field is MV, but only ever has one value, too.\n\nI was talking to Chris Hostetter (Unused) about this, too, and I believe he had some ideas that hopefully he can add here.",
