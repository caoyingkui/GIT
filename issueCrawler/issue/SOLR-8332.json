Sometimes, it would like to make a choice based on some input from users. It should not deal with actual urls. it's the responsibility of Solr to map the urls to actual replicas\n\nSo, Lets have a much simpler interface\n\n\ninterface ReplicaFilter {\n    public List<Replica>  filter(List<Replica> allReplicas, SolrQueryRequest req);\n}\n\n ",

            "content": "Thanks Noble for taking a look at the patch. I have made revisions and opened the above #102 pull request with them because in a patch it can sometimes be difficult to see the context of changes.\n\nReplicaFilter.filter versus ReplicaListTransformer.transform names.\n\n\tThe transformer part of the interface name was quite deliberate to try and be generic about what the transformation might be e.g. it could be removal (i.e. filtering out) of elements or it could just be reordering (e.g. via shuffling) of elements.\n\trevision made:\n\t\n\t\tjavadocs added to ReplicaListTransformer.transform giving filtering and shuffling as example transformations\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nThere being both transform and transformUrls methods.\n\n\tYes, i was uneasy about that as well. Usually Replica objects need to be filtered or reordered but HttpShardHandler can also operate on URLs passed in via the ShardsParam.SHARDS parameter.\n\trevisions made:\n\t\n\t\ttransform(List<Replica>) and transformUrls(List<String>) combined into one transform(List<?> choices) method\n\t\tjavadocs added to mention about Replica vs. String choices\n\t\tToyMatchingReplicaListTransformer class (in tests) to demonstrate how List<?> choices can be used\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nList methodName(List inputs) versus void methodName(List choices) signature.\n\n\tno revisions made: making the parameter input-and-output seems unproblematic and saves having to allocate an output list to be returned\n\n\n\ntransform(List,SolrQueryRequest) versus void transform(List) signature.\n\n\ttransform is called multiple times i.e. once for each shard but there is only one transformer object. The transformer's constructor may take a SolrQueryRequest argument (if needed) and that way request param deciphering happens only once per prepDistributed call.\n\trevisions made:\n\t\n\t\tAdded ReplicaListTransformerTest class to demonstrate (with toy ReplicaListTransformer classes) how SolrQueryRequest params (or indeed SolrQueryRequest itself) could be passed to a ReplicaListTransformer upon construction.\n\t\n\t\n\n ",
