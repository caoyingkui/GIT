    "description": "Hi,\n\nWe are using Solr for our searches. We are facing issues while applying boost on particular fields.\nE.g. \nWe have a field Category, which contains values like Electronics, Computers, Home Appliances, Mobile Phones etc. \nWe want to boost the category Electronics and Mobile Phones, we are using the following query\n(category:Electronics^2 OR category:Mobile Phones^1 OR category:[* TO *]^0)\n\nThe results are unexpected as Category Mobile Phones gets more boost than Electronics even if we are specifying the boost factor 2 for electronics and 1 for mobile phones respectively.\nOn debugging we found that DocFreq is manipulating the scores and hence affecting the overall boost. The no. of docs for mobile phones is much lower than that for electronics and solr is giving higher score to mobile phones for this reason.\n\nPlease suggest a solution.",
