    "description": "Since this is obviously too controversial to fix, we can just add alternatives that don't have this messy api, e.g. under analyzers-simple.\n\nThese won't have Version. They don't need factories, because they are actually geared at being usable for lucene users.\n\nOnce nice thing is, this way the problem can be fixed in 4.10",
