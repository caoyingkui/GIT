    "description": "Since LUCENE-6818 we have DFISimilarity which implements normalized chi-squared distance.\n\nBut there are other alternatives (as described in http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec21/papers/irra.web.nb.pdf):\n\n\n\tnormalized chi-squared: \"can be used for tasks that require high precision, against both short and long queries\"\n\tstandardized: \"good at tasks that require high recall and high precision, especially against short queries composed of a few words as in the case of Internet searches\"\n\tsaturated: \"for tasks that require high recall against long queries\"\n\n\n\nI think we should just provide the three independence measures, and let the user choose. Similar to how we do DFR/IB/etc.",
