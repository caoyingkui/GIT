I got this error when trying to generate a KML file depicting the geohash rectangles via the Solr-Spatial-Sandbox spatial-demo:\n\ncom.spatial4j.core.exception.InvalidShapeException: Ring Self-intersection at or near point (-92.81473397710002, 45.20993823293909, NaN)\n\tat com.spatial4j.core.shape.jts.JtsGeometry.<init>(JtsGeometry.java:90)\n\tat com.spatial4j.core.io.JtsShapeReadWriter.readShape(JtsShapeReadWriter.java:93)\n\tat com.spatial4j.core.context.SpatialContext.readShape(SpatialContext.java:195)\n\tat com.spatial4j.demo.servlet.GridInfoServlet.doPost(GridInfoServlet.java:113)\n\nI also got this error when trying validating the polygon via the JTS TestBuilder (a GUI); I attached a screenshot.  It's very strange that I'm seeing this error yet you are not; you wouldn't have been able to index it without getting this error.\n ",

            "content": "I attached another screenshot of Google Earth with KML loaded for the 1st indexed polygon and for the query shape.  It shows the lines almost touch but not quite \u2013 showing ~28.4 meters in-between.  The KML files were generated via the spatial-demo app, with 0.01 distErrPct.  I was able to load the indexed polygon my adjusting the data near the self-intersection error.\n\nI also attached a new test and I was not able to reproduce the problem you report, even with the default 2.5% distErrPct.  I had to raise it to about 6% until I saw a false intersection.  The fact that you see an intersection and I don't could very well be related to small improvements in the interpretation of distErrPct / distErr / maxDistErr that were done a couple months ago.\n\nI'm going to commit this patch tomorrow.  It does an \"assume\" call to check if JTS is on the classpath.  The test has no compile-time dependencies on JTS, just runtime. ",
