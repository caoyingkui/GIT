    "description": "The new SerializedDVStrategy in lucene-spatial allows storing serialized shape/geometry in DocValues to get very precise matches.  It's mostly for storing polygons & line strings in the index.  It needs a Solr FieldType and a means to use it as a Solr PostFilter so that it gets executed last.  Maybe even add some kind of Shape cache configurable in solrconfig.xml for frequently looked-up shapes too.",
