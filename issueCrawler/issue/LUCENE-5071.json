    "description": "I think this actually affects 3.1.0 and up, but I was too lazy to type all those out and just included release versions for brevity.\n\nDirectIOLinuxIndexInput in 3.6.2 and NativeUnixIndexInput in 4.3.1 have in issue with the seek() method. If we seek() to the end of a file (can happen when merger is doing a clone()) whose length is a multiple of 512, then we will unnecessarily call refill(), which will throw an EOFException.\n\nQuick fix is to surround refill() with this condition:\n\nif (pos < length()) {\n    refill();\n}",
