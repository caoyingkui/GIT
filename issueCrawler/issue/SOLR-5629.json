    "description": "The name attribute on SolrIndexSearcher is used in log lines, but does not include the core name.\n\nSo in a multi-core setup it is unnecessarily difficult to trace what core's searcher is being referred to, e.g. in log lines that provide info on searcher opens & closes.\n\nOne-line patch that helps:\n\nReplace\n\n\nthis.name = \"Searcher@\" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode()) + (name!=null ? \" \"+name : \"\");\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\nthis.name = \"Searcher@\" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode()) + \"[\" + core.getName() + \"]\" + (name!=null ? \" \"+name : \"\");",
