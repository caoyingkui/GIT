    "description": "Solr currently allows a pluggable Lucene Similarity to be specified as:\n\n    <similarity class=\"org.apache.lucene.search.DefaultSimilarity\"/> \n\nThis patch does not change this syntax at all, but detects whether a Similarity or a SimilarityFactory is specified.  The new SimilarityFactory class passes a NamedList from the config file into a getSimilarity(NamedList) method.\n\nYes, I used an interface, damn it!   Let the battles continue.   I've spoken with my code on the issue.  But sure, I'll acquiesce on the topic and turn it into an abstract class if I must - stupid programming languages!  object-oriented programming, not interface or abstract oriented programming   All I ask is ya show me a good case where this interface won't suit your needs, and I'll reply that instead of thinking the problem is the interface, consider it is how the interface is used - it's implicitly designed to be simply that, an interface.  You want a different way to configure, don't like NamedLists for some reason maybe?, we change IndexSchema Similarity construction smarts, perhaps creating another interface.  Same diff, sort of.\n\nI'm proud of the unit test, no XPath in sight.",

A shame Java has to make a distinction, but whatever.   "

I may be misremembering what the Loaders currently provide.  Either way: I'd prefer that new types of plugins implement one of the *InitializedPlugin interfaces for uniformity moving forward.\n\nWouldn't going with the plugin architecture make your proposed SimilarityFactory unnecessary? You could have a similarity registered as default, one as \"writer\", and one as \"search\". Right?\n\nI'm not suggesting just having 2 Similarities per SolrCore, i'm suggesting that a SimilarityFactory be asked to provide a Similarity to use each time a new IndexWriter or a new SolrIndexSearcher is constructed.  if the factory wants to use maintain and use 1 or 2 Similarity instances for everything it can, or each call to getSearchSimilarity could compute some stats on every field in the index and return a new custom instance based on the data.
