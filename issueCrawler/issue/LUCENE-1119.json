    "description": "I found one more optimization, in how terms are written in\nTermInfosWriter.  Previously, each term required a new Term() and a\nnew String().  Looking at the cpu time (using YourKit), I could see\nthis was adding a non-trivial cost to flush() when indexing Wikipedia.\n\nI changed TermInfosWriter.add to accept char[] directly, instead.\n\nI ran a quick test building first 200K docs of Wikipedia.  With this\nfix it took 231.31 sec (best of 3) and without the fix it took 236.05\nsec (best of 3) = ~2% speedup.",
