How about a \"my-core/collection.properties\" file to set the various props? If file exists but is empty it could be a simple marker that this is a core and assume defaults for all settings. And how about adding SOLR_HOME/lib as shared lib folder by convention and SOLR_HOME/core/lib as core-specific lib folder? We might then not need solr.xml at all? "

We unload cores to save memory on some machines, then load them on demand. This would make it much harder for us to accomplish.\n\nAlso, what would happen if a core was unloaded? "
