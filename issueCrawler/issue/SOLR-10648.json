In there you find\n\n-DSTOP.KEY=solrrocks\n-DSTOP.PORT=7983\n\n\n\nThis means that anyone with this info can shut down Solr by hitting that port with the key (if it is not firewalled).\n\nI think the simple solution is to add STOP.PORT and STOP.KEY from $SOLR_START_OPTS to the $SOLR_JETTY_CONFIG[@] variable. It will still be visible on the cmdline but not over HTTP.",

I'll update the description.\n\nYou could argue that someone with shell access to the same box should not be able to stop Solr if he/she does not have access to the 'solr' user or root, but given that Solr most often is the only application running on a server, those with access are likely Solr admins. And even if we redact the STOP:KEY in the UI, a ps -aux will still reveal the cmdline, so it does not really fix that issue.\n\nI propose to close this as won't fix. But herhaps open another issue to unify Metrics hiddenSysProps and RedactionUtils ",
