    "description": "Right now you have to decide which nodes run zookeeper up front - each node must know the list of all the servers in the ensemble. Growing or shrinking the list of nodes requires a rolling restart. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1355 (Add zk.updateServerList(newServerList) might be able to help us here. Perhaps the over seer could make a call to each replica when the list changes and use the update server list call.",

Once we can dynamically change the ZK list, we need to pair that with a discovery mechanism so one can just start up a node (with possibly an optional cluster ID) and solr can find the existing ZK quorum, create a new internal ZK server if needed, add it to the ZK quorum, etc.\n\nOr maybe you were taking about bootstrapping w/ no ZK host/port info when you've configured an external ZK quorum?  Haven't thought about that (or if it would make sense or not). "
