    "description": "MiniSolrCloudCluster was designed to be a \"cloud helper class\" for writting cloud based tests.\n\tTestMiniSolrCloudCluster was designed to be a \"test the cloud helper class\" type of test, verifying that MiniSolrCloudCluster would behave the the documented/expected ways, so people could be confident in writting tests using it.\n\n\n\nBut because TestMiniSolrCloudCluster currently lives in the solr-core test package, it's easy to confuse it for a \"test solr using a cloud helper class\" test, that people might try adding tests of core solr functionality to (see SOLR-8959)\n\nWe should move this test so it's actaully part of the test-framework.",
