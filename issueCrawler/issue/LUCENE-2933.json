    "description": "In the current implementation FST states are expanded into a binary search on labels (from a vector of transitions) when the child count of a state exceeds a given predefined threshold (NUM_ARCS_FIXED_ARRAY). This threshold affects automaton size and traversal speed (as it turns out when benchmarked). For some degenerate  data sets, close-to-the-root nodes could have a small number of children (below the threshold) and yet be traversed on every single seek.\n\nA fix of this is to introduce two control thresholds: \n  EXPAND state if (distance-from-root <= MIN_DISTANCE || children-count >= NUM_ARCS_FIXED_ARRAY)\n\nMy plan is to create a data set that will prove this first and then to implement the workaround above.",

It's of minimal priority, but I checked and this change:\n\na) doesn't seem to degenerate FST compilation performance\nb) hurt traversal performance on real data (checked against the allterms-20110115),\nc) improves worst case behavior on degenerate input sequences.\n\nIf approved, I will commit it in.
