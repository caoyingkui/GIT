    "description": "A colleague is having an issue very similar to the one described at\nhttp://muddyazian.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/how-to-get-solr-500-quick-start.html\n\nHe is running on the latest Arch Linux, and he gets that issue only when he connects to the office network.\n\nWe also have another case when this happens only when a colleague is connected to the office network via VPN from his mac.\n\nI have looked around IMHO, the usage of 'localhost' in the solr code base may be leading to this kind of issues where the resolved IP is not route-able.\n\nDoes it make any sense to replace all usage of 'localhost' in the code base by 127.0.01?",

            "content": "Hello Uwe Schindler\nIMHO, localhost is being used as a fall back if we cannot get an external (public or private) IP for the current node.\nIf a proper IPv6 IP is found, Solr should still work for IPv6 hosts... \n\nNote that 127.0.0.1  is already being put into good usage in few places such as\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/19587a20257f5f23a95c31b74b08d36a512042f3/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cloud/ZkController.java#L567 \n\nAnd using 127.0.0.1 helps avoid resolving localhost into some undesirable IP as it is the case on VPN.\n\nConsistency in the code base may also be something we should consider.
