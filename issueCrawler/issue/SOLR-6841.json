If all the segment detail is on a tooltip, the UI will be very clean.\n\nHere's a series of additional ideas: It would be really nice to be able to change the sort on the bars.  The two primary choices that spring to mind are segment size and the numeric segment number.  Some might even want to sort by maxdoc and/or deleted documents.  If it's not super-difficult, a sort option that groups the bars by \"these segments are the current candidates for the next merge\" would satisfy the original requirements nicely. ",
