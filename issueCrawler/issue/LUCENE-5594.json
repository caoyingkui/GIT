            "content": "Hi,\nI am working on this. I will put up a patch soon.\nMy work includes not calling the svn executable at all, instead we use svnkit to revision numbers or checkout the src folder.\nThis speeds up the build, because we do not need to fork a process all the time, which is expensive on windows and on freebsd jenkins (because we fork Java). Using svnkit to do this and saving the revision number in a property helps. It makes also Jenkins builds more easy to configure, because you do not depend on local svn installations (e.g. Jenkins checks out with different version than locally installed). This is an issue on Policeman enkins and FreeBSD Jenkins. ",

All stuff is no longer done with command line tools, it now does svnversion and also the svn exports using svnkit, grabbed from Maven Central.\n\nThe only thing: the file can get stale. I was trying to not use a file and pass the svnversion down the build, but thats hard to do. I am still working on a better solution... ",
