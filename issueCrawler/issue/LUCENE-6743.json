I use the following in ~/build.properties for a nice hassle free, no .ivy2 folder delete time, existence:\n\nivy.bootstrap.version=2.4.0\nivy_checksum_sha1=5abe4c24bbe992a9ac07ca563d5bd3e8d569e9ed\nivy.lock-strategy=artifact-lock-nio\n\nI first removed ivy 2.3.0 from ~/.ant/lib and then used the ant ivy bootstrap target to pull in 2.4.0. One time upgrade operation.\n\nThe hard part with making this the default is that many devs and users will still have ivy 2.3.0 on the classpath and if we specify the artifact-lock-nio in the config, that won't work AFAIK. We would need to do it somehow conditionally I think. This provides an easy path for anyone else hitting these issues now though. "
