Perhaps I've been missing the point about the function of solrschema.xml, which seems to be given pretty much free rein when defining applicable field types; but I thought that overriding trueProperties etc would be a way of preventing nonsensical configurations.

But it's not clear to me how anyone could make safe use of (the functionality) of falseProperties and trueProperties unless they were subclassing FieldType and in the the same package, simply because FieldProperties.INDEXED etc are package private.  Maybe there's a case for increasing the visibility of FieldProperties and its static constants. "
