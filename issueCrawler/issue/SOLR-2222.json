If yes then also SOLR should also care about it on merging cores.\n\nOur system is using solr with a live core dedicated for inserts that gets merged into a search core from time to time. We expect a better search performance out of this. I expect a negativ performance impact when I have to handle all the duplicated documents after the merge.  "
