            "content": "This adds two bit select methods to BroadWord.java.\n\nselectWithByteLookup() works like select() but uses a lookup to select a bit from a byte in its last phase.\n\nselectWithOverflowAndByteLookup() also adds a lookup to determine the byte of the bit to be selected.\n\nSome very simple benchmarks on my machine (i7-4770, 3.4 GHz) are in the test code in the testPerf* methods. These show that selectWithByteLookup() takes about 20% less time than select(), and that selectWithOverflowAndByteLookup() takes about 33% less time. "

            "content": "These array lookups are given in the article of 2013 by Simon Gog and  Matthias Petri, 2013, \"Optimized Succinct Data Structures for Massive Data\" in Section 6.2, currently available at http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/sgog/optimized.pdf .\n\nA quote from there:\nUnfortunately, the development of efficient select operations on 64 -bit integers ( select 64 ) has not been as rapid as for popcnt . There are no direct CPU instructions available to return the position of the i -th set bit.\n\nAs was noted at http://vigna.di.unimi.it/Sux/select.php ,  these two lookups have the overhead of java array accesses, so it would probably be wortwhile to use a native version of this, at least until better processor support becomes available.\n\nFor the patch here, I'd expect that some speedup in Java is still possible.
