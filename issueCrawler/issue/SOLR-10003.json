    "description": "Certain parallel operations, for example Pregel, require all workers to complete a step in the process before starting the next step. This is sometimes called a superstep.\n\nThis ticket will introduce a Streaming Expression that coordinates the superstep. The basic structure of this syntax is:\n\n\nsuperstep(parallel(daemon(...)))\n\n \n\nEach call to superstep.read() calls a parallel(daemon()) which sends a batch job to the workers. The superstep will only return the tuple from read() when each parallel daemon has completed the step.\n\nUnder the covers the superstep will poll the workers and check the state of the daemons on the workers. New daemon states will be added so that processes can vote to end the entire task. When all workers vote to end the task, the superstep will return the EOF tuple and the job will end.",
