    "description": "In flex branch, TermRef must not contain unpaired surrogates, etc.\nBut in trunk/previous releases, people could (and do) seek to these.\nAlso some lucene multitermqueries will generate these invalid seek locations, even now (which we should separately fix)\nI think the common case is already handled with a hack in SegmentReader.LegacyTermEnum, but we should clean up this hack and handle all cases.\n\nI would also like to use this nextValidUTF16String in LUCENE-1606, and there might be other places it could be used for better bw compat.",
