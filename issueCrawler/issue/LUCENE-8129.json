    "description": "While ICUNormalizer2FilterFactory supports a filter attribute to define a Unicode set filter, ICUFoldingFilterFactory does not support it. A filter allows one to e.g. exclude a set of characters from being folded. E.g. for Finnish and Swedish the filter could be defined like this:\n\n      <filter class=\"solr.ICUFoldingFilterFactory\" filter=\"[^\u00e5\u00e4\u00f6\u00c5\u00c4\u00d6]\"/>\n\nNote: An additional MappingCharFilterFactory or solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory would be needed for lowercasing the characters excluded from folding. This is similar to what ElasticSearch provides (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/analysis-icu-folding.html).\n\nI'll add a patch that does this similar to ICUNormalizer2FilterFactory. Applies at least to master and branch_7x.",

            "content": "Thanks for the patch.\n\nI don't like the change to the way the rules are loaded at all. Its now duplicated across the factory and the filter It also changes the constructor to load it from a file on every invocation whereas before it happened only once, this is too slow for any real use.\n\nI think it is enough to just remove the keyword 'private' on the existing static instance, so that its package-private instead. Then the factory is able to access it, wrap it with a filter, and pass it to Normalizer2Filter. ",
