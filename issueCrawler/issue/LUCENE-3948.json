    "description": "Recent work in LUCENE-3944 has changed how our generated pom.xml files are handled during release preparation, placing them in build/ instead.  However get-maven-poms still places the poms inside src/ so you can use them to drive a build.  What I think would be ideal is if we could unify the release handling of the poms and the normal building handling, so that the poms can sit outside of src and serve both purposes.  \n\nSome time ago I investigated how the ANT project handles its own Maven integration and it has its poms sitting in their own directory.  They then reference the actual src locations inside the poms.  This works for ANT but with a warning since some of their tests don't work due to how the Maven surefire plugin works, so they skip their tests.\n\nI have done some quick testing of my own and this process does seem to work for our poms and tests.  I now want to take this to a full scale POC and see if it works fully.",

            "content": "First shot at this.  I've added a <module-path> to most poms which connects them to the location of the module.\n\nI also fixed the solr/webapp build path in its pom.xml.template which pointed to solr/build and nuked the whole contents on mvn clean.\n\nI haven't changed get-maven-poms so first you must execute ant filter-pom-templates from lucene/.  Then go into build/poms and then you can execute mvn commands.\n\nEverything seems to compile now.  Can't see any bad directories being made.\n\nStill TODO: \n\n\n\tMake use of module-directory inside module-path rather than re-specifying that information.  Need to check if all tests pass.\n\tChange get-maven-poms to use filter-pom-templates.\n\n\n\nIf anybody could give this a whirl to see if it works  ",

(Mixing Lucene and Solr build stuff together under lucene/ is bad.)\n\tThe build output directory should be under maven-build/, rather than the same dirs as those used by the Ant build.\n\n ",
