    "description": "TaxonomyReader which supports ref-counting, has a decRef() method which delegates to an inner IndexReader and calls its .decRef(). The latter may close the reader (if the ref is zeroes) but the taxonomy would remain 'open' which will fail many of its method calls.\n\nAlso, the LTR's .close() method does not work in the same manner as IndexReader's - which calls decRef(), and leaves the real closing logic to the decRef(). I believe this should be the right approach for the fix.",

So it's whoever created the directory responsibility to close it. We should however eliminate the two deprecated ctors which take a File \u2013 no need to have them around anymore, and we're not bound to back-compat in this module, yet . ",

Few minor comments:\n\n\n\tI think that it's better to set closed=true in the end of doClose(), after everything succeeds.\n\tIn doClose, perhaps nullify the two caches? this can come instead of, or in addition to, clear()-ing them\n\tdoClose is package-private: is that on purpose, or did you mean to make it protected/private? Seems to me like it should be private, because you don't want to call it more than once.\n\n ",

Currently, if I call close(), and another thread has an instance of TR, any operations he'll try to do will fail by ensureOpen().\n\nI think that we should remove 'close' and check on IR.refCount(). When it's <= 0, we're closed for business, otherwise the TR should not be marked close().\n\nI looked at IndexReader and two things:\n\n\tIts ensureOpen checks refCount()\n\tIts close looks entirely redundant ...\n\n ",
