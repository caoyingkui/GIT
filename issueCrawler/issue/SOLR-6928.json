The reason why this works for asian text is: if you change the code page to 437 (which is from old DOS days), the console is no longer able to output unicode characters. Because of that it can no longer use the default locale. A side effect is then that it uses English, because the command has no other chance to output something.\n\nOn a German Windows the output stays German, because German perfectly fits into code page 437.\n\nIn fact we would need to find a way to change the locale not just code page.

Also it is not guaranteed that the english locale is there at all - especially on desktop operating systems.\n\nI think we should place the listening port into a temp file (like Process IDs).
