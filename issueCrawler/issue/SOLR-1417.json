Since system.out is not configurable this can get quite spammy on the console.  \n\nShould this be logging at the INFO/DEBUG level using slf4j instead?  \n\nThe system.out.println statement was added on 2009-07-14 as part of SOLR-1129 (r794144).  \n\n\u2014\n\n[1] src/solrj/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/beans/DocumentObjectBinder.java:316 (r794144)\n\n    <T> void inject(T obj, SolrDocument sdoc) {\n      Object val = getFieldValue(sdoc);\n      if(val == null) \n{\n        System.out.println(\"val null for \"+ name);\n        return;\n      }",
