            "content": "I  haven't tried the patch, but I don't see how it deals with the initial state that all sub spans have a start position of -1. In master currently, nextStartPosition iterates over the pq until the start position of the top element is greater than -1, but I don't see that logic in your patch. There is a startDocument method but if I am not mistaken it is only called from two-phase iteration, so if NearSpansUnordered are consumed directly, that would work, but not if they are nested within other spans? (I'm not very familiar with spans so I could easily miss something.) ",

            "content": "... how it deals with the initial state that all sub spans have a start position of -1.\n\nThere is no need for that, the intermediate data structure is a priority queue that is not a Spans itself.\n\nIf the names of this priority queue (SpanTotalLengthEndPositionWindow) and its methods (startDocument/nextPosition) are misleading, they need to be improved.\n\nThe core search tests and precommit pass.
