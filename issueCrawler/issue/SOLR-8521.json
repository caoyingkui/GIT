I don't know that the page makes sense with that many step-by-step screenshots - we don't even have that many covering the Admin UI, and DBVisualizer is not an application developed by this community - but a few key ones would probably be helpful.\n\nAs for where it should go, I wonder if we should take a step back and think about the overall organization of docs for this new features. My current understanding is that the JDBC client is only used with Parallel SQL features, but is it more than that (either today or intended to be more in the future)? If so, we should spend a minute or two thinking about the use cases to figure out the best place for a new section.\n\nedit: by the way, I don't mean to dismiss the effort to make those screenshots, they are very helpful and clear.

The rough outline of steps in the description is really what is required for connecting any JDBC SQL client. I wanted the first guide to be extra clear to start with and then can trim down the unnecessary steps. I'm thinking about writing a blog post about this and that would probably be a better place for a step-by-step guide.\n\nAs a side note: the screenshots will have to be updated with a non snapshot build of Solr. It would make sense to take the final screenshots maybe once an RC is cut or at least update the screenshots at that time. ",

Regardless of what Solr version people are using, it seems like they tend to go look at the latest version of cwiki anyway.

It will be seen as a first class feature, and the fact that we were not able to do that until just recently will be irrelevant. ",

The online version of the Ref Guide is always a draft for the next release; the real Ref Guide is actually the PDF. I happen to agree with you that most users would prefer an online version instead of a giant PDF, but there are reasons why it isn't like that and real obstacles to making it like that. \n\nI get your overall point - a full screenshot-by-screenshot walkthrough is somewhat heavy in the PDF and works better in an online version, but I don't see the harm in adding a couple of screenshots using one client as an example with the way we've got things today. The docs will need to avoid any client-specific details anyway, at least in a section that applies to all clients, even if there is a section that covers a specific client in more detail. ",

Adding up the sizes of all the images added for DBVisualizer, Squirrel, and Zeppelin, they account for ~6Mb of the added size. There are an additional 42 pages of PDF, bringing the whole thing to over 700 pages.\n\nI would like to resize some of the screenshots so they are smaller (when it's possible to do so without losing their value), and take a look at omitting some to replace them with text (again, where the screenshot doesn't add a lot of extra value). I appreciate the visual walk-through, but think we could possibly \"tell the tale\", as it were, without as many screenshots. I won't delete any, so if I screw it up at all and we need to add any back, we can do so. Just wanted to give you a heads up Kevin Risden in case you had a different point of view. ",
