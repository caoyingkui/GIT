Poll the list of open files for the port on which the java process is launched till 30 seconds or the port becomes active which ever is earlier\n        1.2.3. Display the launch message\n        1.2.4. Exit sub shell\n    1.3. Else // if OS does not support lsof\n         1.3.1. Try a grep to get the process id of the java process launched\n         1.3.2.
