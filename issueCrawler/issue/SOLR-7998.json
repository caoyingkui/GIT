            "content": "There are two lines in the bin/solr script that have changed since 5.1 or 5.2 that make the start incompatible with SLES 11 (up to SLES 11.3) as the lsof Version does not support the option \"-sPROTOCOL:PORT\".\n\nIn the script in the line 1321 the lsof call changed from \"lsof -PniTCP:$SOLR_PORT\" to \"lsof -PniTCP:$SOLR_PORT -sTCP:LISTEN\", I assume to only listen the listening ports of TCP. As a workaround you can change the script if there is no outgoing communication to a port like the $SOLR_PORT.\nAlso you could update your SLES version as in SLES 12 the version of lsof changes to 4.84.\n\nHannes ",
