I would prefer we make this change normally and if its appropriate, finds its way to 4.10.4. Bug fix releases are supposed to be easy. "

We can let Jenkins chew on it in trunk/5.x, and see if there are any performance issues in the nightly performance benchmarks (http://people.apache.org/~mikemccand/lucenebench/).\n\nI do think it's a bug though: an FST that would otherwise take ~200 bytes can take ~4 KB instead, because of this cache.

            "content": "I don't disagree with the bug aspect, and i am sure the patch is great.\n\nWe use these FSTs in lots of code so the possibility of a performance bug (separate from correctness issue) exists. We should at least wait for a few iterations of jenkins, ideally some nightly benchmark reports, given how widespread FST usage is, before getting it out to users. This stuff happens automatically with time, but just needs some time. "
