And nuking the class entirely in trunk. ",

If we keep deprecated classes hanging around in trunk on the off-chance that somebody building off trunk isn't following development closely, then we end up with things being carried over for several releases because nobody cleans anything up.\n\nCHANGES.txt is still borked, btw:\n* AdminHandlers is deprecated , /admin/* are implicitly defined, /get ,/replication and handlers are also implicitly registered (refer to SOLR-6792)\n\nLooks like there's a stray 'and' or something else missing there?
