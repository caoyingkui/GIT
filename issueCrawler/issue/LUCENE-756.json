    "description": "Non-compound indexes are ~10% faster at indexing, and perform 50% IO activity comparing to compound indexes. But their file descriptors foot print is much higher. \n\nBy maintaining all field norms in a single .nrm file, we can bound the number of files used by non compound indexes, and possibly allow more applications to use this format.\n\nMore details on the motivation for this in: http://www.nabble.com/potential-indexing-perormance-improvement-for-compound-index---cut-IO---have-more-files-though-tf2826909.html (in particular http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-potential-indexing-perormance-improvement-for-compound-index---cut-IO---have-more-files-though-p7910403.html).",

But the Norm object is now assigned a normSeek value, which is nonzero if the norm file is <segment>.nrm.\n\texisting indexes, prior to this change, are managed the same way that segments resulted of addDocument are managed.\n\n\n\nTests:\n\n\tI verified that also the (contrib) tests for FieldNormModifier and LengthNormModofier are working.\n\n\n\nRemaining:\n\n\tI might add a test.\n\tmore benchmarking?\n\tupdate fileFormat document.\n\n ",

Doron if you agree /\nor we can iterate then I'll commit it!  Thanks.\n\nProposed changes:\n\n\n\tRenamed \"withNrm()\" to \"getHasMergedNorms\" to be more\n    descriptive.  Also changed the field to \"hasMergedNorms\".\n\n\n\n\n\tExplicitly store \"hasMergedNorms\" in the segments_N file.\n\n\n\n    I think in general we should favor storing things like this\n    explicitly instead of relying on IO operations (fileExists).\n    We've made great progress lately in reducing such IO operations so\n    I'd like to keep that up when possible \n\n    I created a new FORMAT_MERGED_NORMS in SegmentInfos for this.  The\n    change is fully backwards compatible (old indices work fine).  I\n    extended TestBackwardsCompatibility to test this.\n\n    This then has the nice side effect of not having to create the\n    fleeting CompoundFileReader in \"SegmentInfo.getHasMergedNorms\"\n    (which was somewhat spooky to me) for indices written to after\n    this is committed.  For indices written to before this gets\n    committed but after the first version was committed (10 days ago),\n    the check is still needed so I've left it in there with a comment.\n\n\n\tFixed the TestDoc unit test to actually create & return\n    SegmentInfo's vs recreating a new SegmentInfo every time (which\n    causes problems whenever we add something to SegmentInfo).  This\n    is still a correct test but more scalable with time as we make\n    changes to SegmentInfo.\n\n ",
