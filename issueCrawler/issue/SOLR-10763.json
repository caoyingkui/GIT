I used this replicationHandler config when testing locally:\n\n<requestHandler name=\"/replication\" class=\"solr.ReplicationHandler\">\n  <lst name=\"slave\">\n    <str name=\"masterUrl\">http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/replication</str>\n    <str name=\"pollInterval\">00:00:10</str>\n  </lst>\n</requestHandler>\n\n\n\nAnd these steps:\n\n\tbin/solr -e techrpoducts\n\tbin/solr start -p 8080\n\tbin/solr create -c techproducts -p 8080\n\tbin/solr stop -p 8080\n\t# Edit server/solr/techproducts/conf/solrconfig.xml to add the replication handler above\n\tbin/solr start -p 8080\n\n\n\nNow you have the master on http://localhost:8983/solr/#/techproducts/replication and the slave on http://localhost:8080/solr/#/techproducts/replication\n\nAdd some docs and verify that version updates on slave\n\n\tbin/post -c techproducts example/exampledocs/books.json\n\n ",

The patch is for master, but I believe it will apply to latest few 6.x too?

So to reproduce one would need to have a master/slave setup, then run a few replications, and then perhaps shut down master to have a few failed replications. ",
