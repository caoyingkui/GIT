In all three cases, the same files are present in both versions.\n\nThis patch also drops tar'ing both of dist/maven/ as dist/solr-maven.tar and of dist/* \u2013 except the .war \u2013 as dist/solr.tar.

            "content": "+1\n\nIts confusing that 'non-dist' stuff goes into the dist/ folder. This is how the .war file accidentally ended up in the release candidate.\n\nIf we apply this patch, then the build stuff then works consistent with lucene's, and its easier for the release manager to correctly upload things, because its all in dist/ "
