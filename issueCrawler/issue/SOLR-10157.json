    "description": "Sample question from a confused solr-user email...\n\n\n> I'm getting this error when I tried to do a division in JSON Facet.\n>\n>   \"error\":{\n>     \"msg\":\"org.apache.solr.search.SyntaxError: Unknown aggregation agg_div in ('div(4,2)', pos=4)\",\n>     \"code\":400}}\n>\n>\n> Is this division function supported in JSON Facet?\n\n\n\nAnd the subsequent followup from the same user...\n\nI found that we can't put div(4,2) directly, as it wouldn't work.\n\nIt will work if I put something like max(div(4,2)).\n\n\n\nIt seems like a better error handline code path for FunctionQParser.parseAgg (once we've confirmed no such aggregation exists) would be:\n\n\n\tattempt to parse the original string as a regular (non-Agg)ValueSource) function\n\t\n\t\tif that succeeds, give the user an error indicating that this ValueSource must be wrapped in an aggregation\n\t\tif it fails, continue to throw the original error\n\t\n\t\n\teither way, any error thrown should refer to the original id before\n\n\n\nFor example: \n\n\tdiv(price,popularity) should throw an error with a msg along the lines of: 'div' is a per-document function, not a multi-document aggregation function, input: div(price,popularity)\n\tHOSS(price,popularity) on the other hand should throw an error such as: Unknown aggregation HOSS in ('HOSS(price,populaity)' ...\n\t\n\t\tnote the message cites HOSS not agg_HOSS",
