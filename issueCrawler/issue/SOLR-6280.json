    "description": "The Collapse QParser does give results if you collapse on a multi-valued field, but the document->value is somewhat arbitrarily chosen based on the internals of the FieldCache (FieldCacheImpl.SortedDocValuesCache).\n\nNote that the Grouping functionality accesses values via FieldType.getValueSource which is a layer of abstraction above that includes a multiValued error check.\n\nCollapse should throw an error here.\n\np.s. easy to test with exampledocs collapsing on \"cat\"",

Don't wrap SolrException again in RunTimeException\n\nAlso, there are cases where IOException is the right kind of exception to use but it has been used. (Preferably SolrException). For now, I haven't touched that code. Should this case also be handled here?? "
