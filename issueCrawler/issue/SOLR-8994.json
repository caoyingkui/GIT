            "content": "I have no unit tests, but I think the problem is quite simple : in o.a.s.handler.SchemaHandler#handleRequestBody, schema write operations are explicitely tied to POST requests.\n\nBut when using EmbeddedSolrServer.request(SolrRequest), another request is forged from the first :\n\n\nreq = _parser.buildRequestFrom(core, params, request.getContentStreams());\n\n\n\nand the Http method of the second request is not set, thus defaulting tog GET and disallowing schema management.\nThe attached simple patch only honours the http method of the incoming SolrRequest by copying it to the second.\n\nI hope that I've been clear \n\nRegards,\nC\u00e9dric ",
