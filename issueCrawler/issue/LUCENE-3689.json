I havent looked at how docvalues is using this, but I think it should be consistent with the \nother per-document codec APIs (stored fields and term vectors)\n\nreally they should flush on close(). finish is defined as just a hook for verification that you actually wrote the # of docs that the caller\nthought it wrote:\n\n  /** Called before {@link #close()}, passing in the number\n   *  of documents that were written. Note that this is \n   *  intentionally redundant (equivalent to the number of\n   *  calls to {@link #startDocument(int)}, but a Codec should\n   *  check that this is the case to detect the JRE bug described \n   *  in LUCENE-1282. */\n\n ",
