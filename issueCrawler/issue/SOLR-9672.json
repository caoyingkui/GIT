This occurs even if the fieldname doesn't need to be wrapped.\n\nI'm mostly using the default solrconfig.xml file (with a few lines taken out)",

Because, as far as I can tell, you have multivalued docvalues and the field documentation says for those cases:\n\nIn it's simplest (single argument) form, this function can only be used on single valued fields..... For multivalued docValues fields: field(myMultiValuedFloatField,min)\n\n\n\nBut that's for numerics. I am not sure whether docValues support for multiValued strings would work here. But on mailing list, more people would see your question. ",
