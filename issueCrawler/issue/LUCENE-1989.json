    "description": "I tried to make CharArraySet using generics (extends AbstractSet<char[]>) but this is not possible, as it e.g. returns sometimes String instances in the Iterator instead of []. Also its addAll method accepts both String and char[]. I think this class is a complete mis-design and violates almost everything (sorry).\n\nWhat to do? Make it Set<?> or just place a big @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\"> in front of it?\n\nBecause of this problem also a lot of Set declarations inside StopAnalyzer cannot be made generic as you never know whats inside.",

            "content": "This is the only possibility to make it somehow genericfied. As all Object subclasses (so everything) contains a toString() method it is no longer a problem to add any object that has a valid String representation to this set.\n\nIt is only strange that the iterator returns Strings and not char[] - why is this so? To fix this, there is also an accessor to get an Iterator<String> correctly casted. ",
