Same situation on the 4.8.1 (http://postimg.org/image/zfb2ww6x5/).\nI wrote:\n\"segmentInfos.indexOf(info)\nalways return -1 because org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos does not have equals method\"\n\nPlease read http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html#indexOf(java.lang.Object) , indexOf uses equals method of an object.\nOn the screenshoot (http://postimg.org/image/jvtezvqnn/) we have two instance of org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfoPerCommit (SegmentCommitInfo on 4.8.1), which has same values, but different for ArrayList, because has not overrided equals method (for example like in the SegmentInfo).  Class must have overriden equals method, if you you want  ArrayList.indexOf works (ArrayList.indexOf into org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos#indexOf)\n\nScreenshoot of debuger on 4.8.1 with 4.3.1 index http://postimg.org/image/zfb2ww6x5/\n\nI saw solr-lucene-core sources there uses hashmap instead list, and works. But in current source code class SegmentCommitInfo need to be equals method.  ",

            "content": "The SegmentInfoPerCommit from the reader should be the very same instance as the one inside IndexWriter's SegmentInfos, and so the Object.equals impl (using ==) works here.\n\nSo we need to figure out why in your case == returns false.  Can you describe where the reader that you are passing in came from?  It must be a near-real-time reader in order to work.\n\nOr can you make a small test case? ",
