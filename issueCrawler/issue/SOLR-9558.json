    "description": "The DIH TemplateTransformer does not support multiple templates with the same column name. Rather than creating a List of values as it should do in this case,  the value of the last <field> tag with the same column name replaces the values of previous transforms for that column. The reason is that it uses a single HashMap to store the transformations with a key on column name. The fix is to detect if a column has previously been transformed within the same field set and to create a List<Object> for that column when this occurrs.",
