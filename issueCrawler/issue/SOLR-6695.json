    "description": "Under Solr 4.10.2 in solrcloud configuration, if I upload a change to solrconfig.xml to zookeeper that raises maxBooleanClauses from 1024 to 2048 and then reload the collection, the cores do not recongnize a new value for maxBooleanClauses unlike other changes to schema.xml and solrconfig.xml. I have to bounce Solr on each node before queries will honor the new value for maxBooleanClauses. This seems like unintentional behavior. I should be able to make any change to schema.xml and solrconfig.xml, then upload those to zookeeper and have each node in the cluster instantly honor all new values after a core/collection reload.",
