    "description": "Currently the More Like This component just ignores the mlt.InterestingTerms parameter ( which is usable by the MoreLikeThisHandler).\n\nScope of this issue is to fix the bug and add related tests ( which will succeed after the fix )\n\nN.B. MoreLikeThisComponent and MoreLikeThisHandler are very coupled and the tests for the MoreLikeThisHandler are intersecting the MoreLikeThisComponent ones .\n It is out of scope for this issue any consideration or refactor of that.\n Other issues will follow.\n\nN.B. out of scope for this issue is the distributed case, which is much more complicated and requires much deeper\u00a0investigations",

            "content": "David Smiley thanks for your comment.\nGenerally in Software Engineering I am a strong supporter of the KISS principle so in short I agree with you, I would love to see both the handler and the component gone, and only the Query Parser left as only entry point for More Like This Lucene functionality.\n\nGiven that, let me analyse what the handler and the component are offering, which the query parser does not.\nThis could generate few other Jira issues to complete before we remove the handler and component :\n\n1) more advanced debug - in my opinion is neglectable, the normal debug will show the query parsed which will be more than enough to understand how the MLT query was built.\n\n2) Interesting Terms - which was the scope of this issue, also in this case I do agree that getting the interesting terms out of a corpus of documents should be a separate feature ( close to faceting than MLT).\ngetting the interesting terms out of the More Like This source document can be done indirectly verifying the debug information for the query parsing\n\n+1 to officially deprecate both the handler and component, those classes are very coupled and not very readable anyway ( with no offese to any author)\nThis will also simplify the work I am doing refactoring the Lucene More Like This ( https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-12299\u00a0) ",
