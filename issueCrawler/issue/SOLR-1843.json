The one significant change i made from your original files (BTW: a patch would have been much easier to review) is that i made the \"rootName\" option completely replace the previous default: \"solr/\" + coreName (as opposed to your version where only the \"solr\" literal was was replaced by the rootName)\n\nSince this lives in solrconfig.xml it's a core specific setting, and core properties can be used to include the coreName in the rootName if that's what people desire "
