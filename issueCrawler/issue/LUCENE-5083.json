    "description": "The problem appears in version 4.3.1 and in revision 1498027.  I\nattached a two-line patch that fixes it.\n\nIn method \"FuzzySet.getNearestSetSize\", the loop over\n\"usableBitSetSizes\" keeps overriding \"result\" with\n\"usableBitSetSizes[i]\".  Therefore, only the last written value is\nvisible out of the loop and all the other writes and iterations are\nnot necessary.  The patch iterates from the end of \"usableBitSetSizes\"\nand breaks the first time when \"result\" is set.",
