    "description": "I had a solrcloud with 3 shards on different servers. All the normal full text search are perfect. But when I try to facet the text stream field. I always got this error message:\n\nEndOfStreamException: Unable to read additional data from client sessionid 0x141ff828d5f0001, likely client has closed socket at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.doIO(NIOServerCnxn.java:220) at org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxnFactory.run(NIOServerCnxnFactory.java:208) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:724)\n\nWhen I try to facet some fields like Gender which only has two options : m and f, it works perfectly fine. I have been stuck on this for a while, any one can help me out?\n\nThanks in advance.",

In this case, it's likely you your packets are being truncated due to trying to facet on a field with a high cardinality. I'd recommend reviewing your packet limits and timeouts. "
