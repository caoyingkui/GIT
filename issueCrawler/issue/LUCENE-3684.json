    "description": "I think should explore making start/end offsets a first-class attr in the\npostings APIs, and fixing the indexer to index them into postings.\n\nThis will make term vector access cleaner (we now have to jump through\nhoops w/ non-first-class offset attr).  It can also enable efficient\nhighlighting without term vectors / reanalyzing, if the app indexes\noffsets into the postings.",

I think we just need two assertEquals() in TestDuelingCodecs for the future.\n\nI agree about checkIndex, we shouldnt check anything about the offsets. The user could store something crazy\nin the offsets if they want.\n\nFor checkindex, long term i think we should really consider adding a (slow, not by default) option to verify \nthe term vectors against the postings. we could at least turn it on in tests..., but thats another separate issue.

We already changed this format since flex (ie. DocValues) without adding a new format. In LUCENE-3687 I separated the 3x and 4.0 format and removed all the previous formats from 4.0 I think this code should start with a min3xFormat-1.\n\n ",

I fixed it.\n\nBut i think this is wrong, we must use compareTo >= 0?\n\nRight \u2013 I fixed several places that were still doing == or !=.  I left ones in non-SimpleText codecs \u2013 they are still OK since they refuse to index offsets.\n\nI think this code should start with a min3xFormat-1.\n\nAhh right!  I removed that and just kept FORMAT_FLEX.\n\nThanks for the reviews Robert and Simon! ",
