    "description": "In LUCENE-1540 TrecContentSource moved from Java's GZipInputStream to common-compress 1.0. \nThis slowed down gzip decompression by a factor of 15. \nUpgrading to 1.1 solves this problem.\nI verified that the problem is only in GZIP, not in BZIP.\nOn the way, as 1.1 introduced constants for the compression methods, the code can be made a bit nicer.",

Can u plz check if we can use only one of them under Lucene/Solr?\n\nI've been thinking for some time that we need a module with common libraries used throughout the project. Something w/o code, only jars. I think we have several copies of some jars today, especially Apache ones. Consolidate all of them in one place will be great. We can do this in a separate issue though\u2026 ",
