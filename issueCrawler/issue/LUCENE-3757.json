    "description": "The documentation of IndexReaderContext.leaves() states that it returns (for convenience) all leave nodes, if the context is top-level (directly got from IndexReader), otherwise returns null. This is not correct for AtomicReaderContext, where it returns null always.\n\nTo make it consistent, the convenience method should simply return itsself as only leave for atomic contexts. This makes the utility method ReaderUtil.leaves() obsolete and simplifies code.",
