The rest looks very good to me.\n\nCao Manh Dat:\n\n\n\tyour patch seems to have re-arranged SoftAutoCommitTest, moving the testSoftAndHardCommitMaxDocs method i added in my early patch, making it hard to compare your patch with mine to understand what changes you are suggesting (ie: I applied my patch to one checkout, and your patch to a diff checkout, and tried to diff them and the results showed that the method moved completely so individual changes inside the method weren't obvious) ... so it's not clear to me at first glance how you suggest we \"assert that all docs from 0 -> softCommitMaxDocs must be searchable\"\n\tI think, in general, given how flakey and timing sensitive these autocommit tests can be, that we should focus on making incremental small changes and letting them soak on jenkins for several weeks \u2013 hence the reason i created individual sub-tasks (like this one) of SOLR-11053.\n\tIf you think that there are (purely additive) additional assertions/improvements that can/should be made to my proposed SoftAutoCommitTest.testSoftAndHardCommitMaxDocs, i would suggest splitting your additional assertions out into a new sub-task, and committing my earlier patch first \u2013 following up with your additions later \u2013 to help isolate them if there are any potential timing issues on jenkins machines (and make it simple to review & comment on your suggested improvements in isolation)\n\tmy chief concern being that the additional \"all docs ... must be searchable\" assertions you are suggesting may be just as problematic in SoftAutoCommitTest as AutoCommitTest is currently.  (as i mentioned: the motivation of these individual subtasks for SOLR-11053 is to focus on small, discrete, self contained, improvements \u2013 and then in the parent issue ultimately ask the question: \"have we duplicated the (viable) code coverage to the point we can remove AutoCommitTest?\"\n\n ",
