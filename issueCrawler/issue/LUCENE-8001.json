    "description": "There are a couple of issues with UnescapedCharSequence:\n\n1. The private constructor is not used anywhere (and if it were, it would throw exceptions)\n2. The ToEscapedString() overload has an invalid condition that will only evaluate to true if the string has a length of 0.\n\nThere are no tests for UnescapedCharSequence so these issues have gone unnoticed for quite some time.",
