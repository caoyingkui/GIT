In most cases there is just the property existence check missing somewhere and the code fails after it was hit by the first non-existent property. The same applies to IBM J9, but this was fixed by me in 5.x.\nThe code should add an if check for all properties reported, because this may largely differ on some JVMs. E.g. in Java 9, the bootclasspath setting is missing... On Windows it does not return file handles,... ",
