    "description": "Merging results stage is closely related to search query handling in QueryComponent. In federated environment it is pretty complex part (could require sending requests to shards or collections representations) and can implement various algorithms. I think that it should be implemented as separate module pluggable to QueryComponent or even as whole separate Component.\n\nThe simple implementation could use CollectionSelectionComponent results.\n\nAny suggestions welcome!",
