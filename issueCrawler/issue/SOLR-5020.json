    "description": "This issue adds a finish() method to the DelegatingCollector class so that it can be notified when collection is complete. \n\nThe current collect() method assumes that the delegating collector will either forward on the document or not with each call. The finish() method will allow DelegatingCollectors to have more sophisticated behavior.\n\nFor example a Field Collapsing delegating collector could collapse the documents as the collect() method is being called. Then when the finish() method is called it could pass the collapsed documents to the delegate collectors.\n\nThis would allow grouping to be implemented within the PostFilter framework.",

            "content": "We discussed this on another issue (I think I may have opened it, not sure), the thing is that if someone calls search(Query, Filter, Collector), they know when its done, when this very method returns!\n\nI also tried to look at what it would take (even though it seems stupid for lucene), thinking it might make things easier somehow for people: and tried to test that all collectors were well-behaved, and its really complicated.\n\nSo after review I think it doesnt make a lot of sense there.
