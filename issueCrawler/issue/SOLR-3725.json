            "content": "Thanks Michael! I ran package-src-tgz versus package-local-src-tgz a few times and compared the file list in the tar output,\nactually it should be 30M but includes some unnecessary .jars. I iterated until these were equal, and came up with this simpler\npattern for the .jars\n\n\n-                  excludes=\"build ${package.dir}/** ${dist}/**\n-                            example/webapps/*.war example/exampledocs/post.jar\n+                  excludes=\"build/** ${package.dir.rel}/** ${dist.rel}/**\n+                            example/webapps/*.war example/lib/**\n+                            **/*.jar \n\n\n\nI'll commit your patch soon (with this tweak).
