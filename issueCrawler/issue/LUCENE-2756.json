    "description": "This was reported on the userlist, in the context of range queries.\n\nIts also easy to make our existing tests fail with my patch on LUCENE-2751:\n\nant test-core -Dtestcase=TestBoolean2 -Dtestmethod=testRandomQueries -Dtests.seed=7679849347282878725:-903778383189134045\n\n\n\nThe fundamental problem is that MultiSearcher first rewrites against individual subs, \nthen uses Query.combine() which simply OR's these sub-clauses.\n\nThis is incorrect for expanded MUST_NOT queries (e.g. from wildcard), as it violates demorgan's law.",
