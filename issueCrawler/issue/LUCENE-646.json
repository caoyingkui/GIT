    "description": "This patch contains numerous small fixes for the \"getting started\"\npages on the Lucene Java web site.  Here are the rough fixes:\n\n\n\tTo results.jsp:\n\n\n\n\n\tchanged StopAnalyzer -> StandardAnalyzer\n\n\n\n\n\tchanged references of \"url\" to \"path\" (field \"url\" is never set\n      and was therefore always null)\n\n\n\n\n\tremove prefix of \"../webapps\" from path so clicking through works\n\n\n\n\n\tFixed typos, grammar and other cosmetic things.\n\n\n\n\n\tModernized some things that have changed with time (names of JAR\n    files, which languages have analyzers, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\tAdded outbound links to Javadocs, Wiki, Lucene static web site,\n    external sites, when appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\tRemoved exact version of Tomcat for the demo web app (I think all\n    recent versions of Tomcat will work as described)\n\n\n\n\n\tOther small changes...\n\n\n\nNet/net I think this is an improved version of what's available on the\nsite today.",
