    "description": "Currently the blendedInfix suggester considers just the first match position when scoring a suggestion.\nFrom the lucene-dev mailing list :\n\"\nIf I write more than one term in the query, let's say\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Mini Bar Fridge\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI would expect in the results something like (note that allTermsRequired=true and the schema weight\u00a0field always returns 1000)\n\u00a0\n\n\tMini Bar Fridge something\n\tMini Bar Fridge something else\n\tMini Bar something Fridge \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\tMini Bar something else Fridge\n\tMini something Bar Fridge\n...\n\u00a0\nInstead I see this:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\u00a0Mini Bar\u00a0something\u00a0Fridge\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n-\u00a0Mini Bar\u00a0something else\u00a0Fridge\n-\u00a0Mini Bar Fridge\u00a0something\n-\u00a0Mini Bar Fridge\u00a0something else\n-\u00a0Mini\u00a0something\u00a0Bar Fridge\n...\n\u00a0\nAfter having a look at the suggester code (BlendedInfixSuggester.createCoefficient), I see that the component takes in account only one position, which is the lowest position (among the three matching terms) within the term vector (\"mini\" in the example above) so all the suggestions above have the same weight\u00a0\n\"\nScope of this Jira issue is to improve the BlendedInfix to better manage those scenarios.",
