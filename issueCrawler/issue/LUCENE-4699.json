To fix this I just rerun my tests and the error is gone.\n\nI believe it's probably caused by something I'm doing wrong, but I was hoping to get some kind of declared exception and not an assertion error.",

It means that a file that is referenced by the current commit (according to SegmentInfos) is in fact not present.\n\nCan you post your test?\n\nIf you run with assertions disabled do you not hit an exception in Lucene?  This is a rather catastrophic failure so you should be hitting some exception later on (possibly when trying to open a reader against this commit point). ",

Now I can go off and try to investigate a little bit more.\n\nAs I mentioned there's a very good chance that I screwed something up in my unit test, because when the test is complete the temporary folder with all the indexes is removed.  The test actually starts a server and then shuts it down, but it might resume and delete the folder before the shutdown is complete. ",
