I have seen that Solr 7 allows to merge non-docvalues segments to ones with docvalues using uninverter with a special mergepolicy. IMHO, this merge policy should be the default, just printing a line of information to the logs, so users know that their index segments are updated and this may temporarily require more ram. When using an index created with 7.x  (maybe using the new metadata added by Adrien Grand recently) and something tries to access FieldCache (e.g. for sorting or facetting or functions), it should fail the query.\n\nIn addition, the merge policy could also be used to convert Trie* to Point* values by first uninverting (if no docvalues on trie) and redindexing the fields during merging...

I have seen that Solr 7 allows to merge non-docvalues segments to ones with docvalues using uninverter with a special mergepolicy. ...\n\nThat feels like a very orthoginal idea (or 2?) that should really be discussed in their own Jiras since they are broader in scope then just Trie vs Point.  (I'm not familar enough with what would be involved to even create the jira)\n\n\nI'd suggest to also enable DocValues by default for all string/numeric/date fields, unless explicitly disabled.\n\nI like this idea \u2013 but it's definitely orthoginal to the topic at hand.\n\nI've spun that off into SOLR-10808\n\n\n\n\nI put the blocker priority since I think it is a better experience if all 7.x indices can be used with Solr 8, but there is also the possibility of just removing Trie*Field in 8.0 and refusing to open any index that would make use of those fields, even if they were created in 7.x.\n\nCoincidently, sarowe & cassandra & I were just talking yesterday about our concerns that beyond \"known gaps\" in terms of Solr features that work with Trie fields but not (yet) Point fields (ex:  SOLR-9989, SOLR-10503, SOLR-9985, etc...) a larger concern as we move towards 7.0 is that test coverage of PointFields in Solr is currently pretty shallow.  We don't really have a very good idea of what does/doesn't work with PointFields, which is disconcerting for pushing them as the \"default\" (or \"recommended\") numeric types in Solr \u2013 let alone forbiding the use of (new) Trie fields as suggested here.\n\nWhich is why I've started working on SOLR-10807 \u2013 the current aim is a quick and dirty way to help identify all of the potentially problematic areas as quickly as possible, by forcing every test to use PointFields instead of TrieFields.  See comments in that Jira for details, but the nutshell is: at this point it's hard to guess how many features/test might fail if we cut over to PointFields \u2013 because a big portion of our tests are using/expecting the 'id' field to be numeric, and before we can even get to the meat of the test, using a Point based numeric as the 'id' field causes all sorts of problems because they don't have any 'Terms' for updateDocument/deleteDocument\n\nIn addition, the merge policy could also be used to convert Trie* to Point* values by first uninverting (if no docvalues on trie) and redindexing the fields during merging... (not sure how to do this, but should work somehow).\n\nIf we think it's viable to create a MergePolicy (Wrapper) that could convert Trie fields to Point fields, then my straw many suggestion would be that in 7.x we only discourage Trie fields, but not ban them completely \u2013 with some strongly worded warnings that Trie Fields will be completely removed in 8.0, and any index that uses them will require manual upgrade using a special converstion tool.\n\nAs things stand today, even if that MergePolicy/tool doesn't yet exist when 7.0 comes out, I'd rather say \"7.x indexes using Trie fields MAY require reindexing in 8.0, pending possible development of a tool to upgrade Trie fields to Point fields\" then ban Trie fields outright.\n\n(Hell: As things stand today, even if we were confident it would be impossible to create such a tool/mergepolicy, I'd still rather say \"7.x indexes using Trie fields will REQUIRE reindexing in 8.0\" then to change the default configsets in 7.0 to use Points, let alone ban new Trie fields)\n\n\n ",
