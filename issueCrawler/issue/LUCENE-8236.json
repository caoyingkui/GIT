    "description": "GeoPath has the current behavior:\n\n\tWhen provided a path with two consecutive identical points: In all cases it generates an IllegalArgumentException because it tries to build a plane with those two points.\n\tWhen provided a path with two consecutive numerical identical points: In case of GeoStandardPath it throws an IllegalArgumentException because the path is too short. The case of GeoDegeneratePath is more complicated as it builds the path but the plane can be bogus. In some cases points on the other side of the world can be \"In Set\".\n\n\n\nI think the factory should filter out these points, in the same way it is done for GeoPolygon. If this is not the desired behavior then the factory\u00a0 should throw a consistent IllegalArgumentException in all cases.",
