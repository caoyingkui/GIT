    "description": "As noted by Scott Dawson on the mailing list, the luceneMatchVersion in the 5.1 sample configs all still lists \"5.0.0\".\n\nThe root cause seems to be because the check-example-lucene-match-version task in solr/build.xml is looking in the wrong place \u2013 it's still scaning for instances of luceneMatchVersion in the example directory instead of the server/solr/configset\n\nTODO:\n\n\tfix the luceneMatchVersion value in all sample configsets on 5x\n\tupdate the check to look in the correct directory\n\tupdate the check to fail to be smarter know that we have a more predictable directory structure\n\t\n\t\tfail if no subdirs found\n\t\tfail if any subdir doesn't contain conf/solrconfig.xml\n\t\tfail if any conf/solrconfig.xml doesn't contain a luceneMatchVersion\n\t\tfail if any luceneMatchVersion doesn't have the expected value",
