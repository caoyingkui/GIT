    "description": "It takes 30 seconds to execute TestLBHttpSolrClient.testReliablity. As this test detects thread leak, we must wait for all servers to be searchable. Though TestLBHttpSolrClient.waitForServer appears to wait for the stopped server, the server name is wrong and it keeps waiting until timeout expires.\n\nIf the server name is modified correctly, this test takes only around 3 seconds.",
