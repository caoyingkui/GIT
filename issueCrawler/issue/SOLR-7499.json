    "description": "Right now we take a \"name\" parameter in the ADDREPLICA call. We use that as the core name for the replica. Are there any use cases where specifying the name of the core for the replica is useful?\n\nHere are the disadvantages of doing so -\n1. We don't verify if the name is unique in the collection. So if a conflicting name ends up in the same node then the call will fail.\n2. If it core is created on some other node, it will fail with legacyCloud=false as that checks for uniqueness in core names.\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Collections+API#CollectionsAPI-api_addreplica - The ref guide has never documented the \"name\" parameter.",

            "content": "I can go both ways on this. On the one hand, it's perfectly legitimate for an admin to want to have full control over the replica names. OTOH, it's a fine way to shoot oneself in the foot.\n\nIt seems to me that we either remove it or make it safe. \"Make it safe\" means check up-front for any other core with the same name anywhere in the collection (not just on the same node) and fail if one exists.\n\nOverall, though, since we don't allow the user to specify names of cores when creating collections, there's no real reason to allow it on the ADDREPLICA command so let's nuke it, or at least remove it from the docs and call it \"expert\".
