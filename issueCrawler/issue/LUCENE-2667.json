    "description": "We worked a lot on FuzzyQuery, but you need to be a rocket scientist to ensure good results.\n\nThe main problem is that the default distance is 0.5f, which doesn't take into account the length of the string.\nTo add insult to injury, the default number of expansions is 1024 (traditionally from BooleanQuery maxClauseCount)\n\nI propose:\n\n\tThe syntax of FuzzyQuery is enhanced, so that you can specify raw edits too: such as foobar~2 (all terms within 2 levenshtein edits of foobar). Previously if you specified any amount >=1, you got IllegalArgumentException, so this won't break anyone. You can still use foobar~0.5, and it works just as before\n\tThe default for minimumSimilarity then becomes LevenshteinAutomata.MAXIMUM_SUPPORTED_DISTANCE, which is 2. This way if you just do foobar~, its always fast.\n\tThe size of the priority queue is reduced by default from 1024 to a much more reasonable value: 50. This is what FuzzyLikeThis uses.\n\n\n\nI think its best to just change the defaults for this query, since it was so aweful before. We can add notes in migrate.txt that if you care about using the old values, then you should provide them explicitly, and you will get the same results!",

Changes to the queryparsers look good to me I only have one comment about the harmony code, could you put the svn path and revision into a comment so we can track possible changes later more easily? I personally think moving to 1.6 is far away \n\n\nI propose:\n\n+1 to all the proposals  ",
