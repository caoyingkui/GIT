If someone intended that, they should have said so yes/no?\n\nPersonally i'd prefer my patch to sarowe's, because then the generated javadocs don't change depending on if/when the oracle URL is up.  In general I disagree with sarowe's comment that ignoring the warning would mean we \"attempt to do the right thing\" \u2013 because that implies that linking to the oracle.com URL is \"the right thing\" ... i think we should move away from that thinking.  In my opinion \"the right thing\" is to build our own docs and not make assumptions about external docs.  If the end user wants to build docs that hyperlink to oracle.com (or my.company.com/javadocs) that can be their choice, and if the URL is down and the linkage fails then the build.xml should fail to generate the docs because it couldn't do what the user asked it to.\n\nbut honestly: either patch is better then what we've got now.
