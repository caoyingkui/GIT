    "description": "Was running a Solr 7.0 snapshot (commit 5ef60af) and noticed that the create collection pop up cuts off some of the argument names. Specifically, the replicationFactor and maxShardsPerNode.\n\nWould be nice to use a bigger box or line wrap there, maybe. Have not tested other versions, but also saw the same behaviour on Chrome 53.0.2785.143 on Ubuntu.\n\nScreen shot attached.",
