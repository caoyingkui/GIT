    "description": "Currently, the top level \"filter\" in the JSON Request API is implemented by copying those values back to \"fq\" parameters, since that is what other components currently check.\n\nWe should do a better job of isolating the creation of filters so other components don't have to know/care how they were created (i.e. what parameters were used, what syntax was used, etc).\n\nAfter that, it will be much easier to support filter queries in JSON syntax:\n\n{\n query : \"myquery\", \n filter : [ {term : {field:myfield, val:myval}} , \"another filter\" ],\n limit : 10\n}",
