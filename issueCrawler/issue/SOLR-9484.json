Say you increase the maxShardsPerNode for a collection using this API, if you try to add a replica immediately after modify collection API returns then the overseer sometimes doesn't see the updated property and refuses to add a new replica.",

            "content": "Thanks Dat. A few comments:\n\n\tThe Thread.sleep should move to end of the loop instead of the start. This is so that the first iteration doesn't sleep unnecessarily.\n\tThe DocCollection variable is named \"clusterProps\". Cluster props indicate that this is a cluster property but it is not. It should be called collection instead.\n\tThe \"isEquals\" doesn't indicate its purpose very well. Perhaps better to rename it as \"isCollectionModified\" or maybe \"areChangesVisible\"?\n\n ",
