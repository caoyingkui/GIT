It's here:\nhttps://github.com/OtherLevels/es_fdr\n\nIt's basically a hack at existing Lucene classes like CompressingStoredFieldsReader.\n\nIt has some caveats and does seem limited to files < 100MB but it's a start and may suggest a refactoring for Lucene to make in the future (by not coupling the fields info to the reader).
