    "description": "As of version 3.1 Plugininfo adds all nodes whose types are not \"lst\",\"str\",\"int\",\"bool\",\"arr\",\"float\" or \"double\" to the children list.\n\nThe type \"long\" is missing in the NL_TAGS set.\nI assume this a bug because DOMUtil recognizes this type, so I consider it a valid tag in solrconfig.xml\nMaybe it's time for a dtd? Or one may define SolrConfig.nodetypes somewhere.\nI'll add a patch, that extends the NL_TAGS Set.",
