Are you thinking it's just very unlikely this is used by anything except BooleanScorer2?\n\nWe also have at least ReqOptSumScorer (and maybe others?) which is public. ",

Note that in the follow-up issue to 1614 (the number is yet to be generated) I intend to change the logic in ReqExclScorer so that it conforms to the new semantics of DISI.\n\nWhy do we need to make this class package-private? Any particular reason besides not needing to worry about changes to back-compat in the future? ",

            "content": "This should only affect external code that uses the ReqExclScorer class.\nFrom the amount of reactions on that so far I think such code probably does not exist.\n\nThe move to DocIdSetIterator (superclass of Scorer) can be done because no score values are used on the excluded part. This is only a consequence of the extraction of the DocIdSetIterator superclass from Scorer.\n\nSo I don't expect LUCENE-1614 or new semantics of DISI to collide with this.\nAlso, I don't expect LUCENE-1614 to collide with LUCENE-1345 that allows filter as clause to boolean query.\n\nSome time ago DisjunctionSumScorer was made private in a similar way.\n\nReqOptSumScorer could also be made package private, perhaps even at the same time as ReqExclScorer.\n\n ",
