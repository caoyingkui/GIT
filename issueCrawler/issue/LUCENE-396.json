    "description": "Currently, if you index a document that contains \"climate of change\", then a\nphrase query of \"climate change\" will return that document because StopFilter\ndoes not increment a token's position when skipping stopwords. A patch was\ninitially applied to StopFilter in Nov of 2003 but then reverted in Dec of 2003\ndue to conflicts. PhraseQuery has since been modified and extend and the patch\ncan be re-applied.",
