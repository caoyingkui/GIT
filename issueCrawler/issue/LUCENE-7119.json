    "description": "Currently, DocTermOrds refuses to build if doc values have been enabled for a field.  While good for catching bugs, this disabled what can be legitimate use cases (such as just trying out an alternate method w/o having to re-configure and re-index, or even using consistently in conjunction with UninvertingReader).  We should restore the ability to use this class in other scenarios via adding a flag to bypass the check.",
