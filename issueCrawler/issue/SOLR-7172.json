            "content": "Shalin Shekhar Mangar Noble Paul Pinging you two since you've been into Assign more recently than I have and this looks bogus. But then again it's late and I suspect I'm missing something obvious. So before I dive into this am I off base?\n\nAnyway, Assign.getNodesForNewShard doesn't make sense to me. First of all, it's only called from CREATESHARD and ADDREPLICA. It looks like copy/paste from CREATE though, and some assumptions just don't seem to work. The error message about \"cannot create collection\" is totally bogus since this is never called from CREATE. (thus this JIRA, which is much more serious I think than a wonky error message).\n\nAnyway, part of the problem is in the calculations around line 208:\n\n\n    int maxCoresAllowedToCreate = maxShardsPerNode * nodeList.size();\n    int requestedCoresToCreate = numSlices * repFactor;\n    int minCoresToCreate = requestedCoresToCreate;\n    if (maxCoresAllowedToCreate < minCoresToCreate) { throw long, complex error}\n\n\n\nIn these two operations, this doesn't take into account the replicas for the collection already on the nodes in nodeList. It seems to me that nodeList is the wrong thing to be looking at as well, we've already collected a list of nodes we could put additional replicas on, and the counts of replicas belonging to the collection in question already on those nodes in nodeNameVsShardCount, shouldn't we be using those? And shouldn't the error be thrown if the number of available slots < numberOfNodes? The number of available slots isn't calculated correctly I don't think.\n\nHow this interacts with rules is a mystery to me though, don't want to wade around in this without a check. The attached patch is full of nocommits but shows what I had in mind. But it's late so don't look too closely, if you two think this is on track I'll make it a real patch. ",

It totally relies on the rules to identify the nodes\n\nWhile you are working on this please rename the class Node to something like ReplicaCount or whatever is suitable  ",
