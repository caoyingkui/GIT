    "description": "Technically this bug is in Lucene spatial but it's on a factory that is only really used by the Solr adapter, plus I added a mandatory attribute so I decided to file it here.\n\nThe maxDetailDist attribute on SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType is interpreted as kilometers for a geospatial context.  However, for this first release of spatial, all distances are standardized on degrees.  Of course I want to support kilometers but not inconsistently and there isn't time for that right now.  Because this is likely to be a common problem of interpreting distances for this field, I decided to add a mandatory attribute \"units\" which must be \"degrees\".  When kilometers is supported then it will be added.\n\nFurthermore, the name \"maxDetailDist\" as a name isn't so great. As part of some renames related to this sort of thing a month back I overlooked this one.  I think \"maxDistErr\" is better and more consistent with attributes such as \"distErr\" you can put in shape query.",
