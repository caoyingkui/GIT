    "description": "Ever since we added readerClosedListeners to evict FieldCache entries, LTC will no longer detect insanity as long as the test closes all readers leading to insanity ...\n\nSo this has weakened our testing of catching accidental insanity producing code.\n\nTo fix this I think we could tap into FieldCacheImpl.setInfoStream ... and ensure the test didn't print anything to it.\n\nThis was a spinoff from LUCENE-4953, where that test (AllGroupHeadsCollectorTest) is always producing insanity, but then because of a bug the FC eviction wasn't working right, and LTC then detected the insanity.",
