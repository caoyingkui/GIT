There are only a few points where it requires Solr core classes.They can be isolated out and we have an API in hand. If we limit the dependency down to common util then DIH can be used by \n\n\tLucene users directly\n\tRun DIH remotely with SolrJ\n\tBy any other tools using Lucene as their underlying  datastore",

This is quite unique to Lucene. \n\nWhile a few users might find it useful, it can't be generalized. The moment it is made possible , there may be requests for enhancements specific to DB . I do not wish to get into the domain of Kettle or Talend. \n\nBut I shall leave the core generic enough to be used by others\n "
