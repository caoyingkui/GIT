    "description": "We have a simple domain where\n\nFirstName_s:\"Bob\"\nreturns 40 documents, and\n\n-Department_t:\"Ninjas\"\nreturns all of the documents (we don't have a ninja department).\n\nWe expected the query\n\n(FirstName_s:\"Bob\") OR (-Department_t:\"Ninjas\")\nto return all documents, however it only returned the original 40 documents.\n\nWe have experimented with a couple of different orderings, tried using 'NOT' instead of '-' all to no avail.\n\nIs this expected behavior? Perhaps more importantly, how do we get the behavior we expect?",
