    "description": "This issue occurs when using the grouping feature in distributed mode and sorting by score.\n\nEach group's docList in the response is supposed to contain a maxScore entry that hold the maximum score for that group. Using the current releases, it sometimes happens that this piece of information is not included:\n\n\n{\n  \"responseHeader\": {\n    \"status\": 0,\n    \"QTime\": 42,\n    \"params\": {\n      \"sort\": \"score desc\",\n      \"fl\": \"id,score\",\n      \"q\": \"_text_:\\\"72\\\"\",\n      \"group.limit\": \"2\",\n      \"group.field\": \"group2\",\n      \"group.sort\": \"score desc\",\n      \"group\": \"true\",\n      \"wt\": \"json\",\n      \"fq\": \"group2:72 OR group2:45\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"grouped\": {\n    \"group2\": {\n      \"matches\": 567,\n      \"groups\": [\n        {\n          \"groupValue\": 72,\n          \"doclist\": {\n            \"numFound\": 562,\n            \"start\": 0,\n            \"maxScore\": 2.0378063,\n            \"docs\": [\n              {\n                \"id\": \"29!26551\",\n                \"score\": 2.0378063\n              },\n              {\n                \"id\": \"78!11462\",\n                \"score\": 2.0298104\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"groupValue\": 45,\n          \"doclist\": {\n            \"numFound\": 5,\n            \"start\": 0,\n            \"docs\": [\n              {\n                \"id\": \"72!8569\",\n                \"score\": 1.8988966\n              },\n              {\n                \"id\": \"72!14075\",\n                \"score\": 1.5191172\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nLooking into the issue, it comes from the fact that if a shard does not contain a document from that group, trying to merge its maxScore with real maxScore entries from other shards is invalid (it results in NaN).\n\nI'm attaching a patch containing a fix.",
