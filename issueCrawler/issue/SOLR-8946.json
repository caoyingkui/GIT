    "description": "Summary:  I think the post bash script tries to detect stdin the wrong way.\n\nIf I run \"post -h\" I see some examples, to include this:\n\necho '{commit: {}}' | bin/post -c my_collection -type application/json -out yes -d\n\n\nHowever if I try it, Solr returns this error: Cannot parse provided JSON: JSON Parse Error: char=<,position=0 BEFORE='<' AFTER='add/>'\n\nI see that post is sending an <add /> in certain cases, but it's not supposed to when the mode is stdin.  Looking closer, it appears to be because of this line:\nif [[ -s /dev/stdin ]]; then\nIf I change it to this (which I figured out after googling around; I'm no bash expert!):\nif [[ ! -t 0 ]]; then\nApparently '0' represents stdin.  It works for me.  Timothy Potter might you take a look?  I'd be happy to add a formal patch & commit for this trivial change but it really needs other eyes.",

It was being added for stdin mode too which was weird.\n\nAFAICT the former /dev/stdin check worked on Mac OS X / Darwin, but failed on Ubuntu/Debian.  I have no idea how, say, Fedora/CentOS would fair.  I would appreciate it if someone give it a shot.  I did some playing around with bin/post and I think this works and the correct use of <add/> is an improvement too.  It would be nice to get this into Solr 5.5.1. ",
