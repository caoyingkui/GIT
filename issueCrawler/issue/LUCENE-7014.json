    "description": "Re-phrased from Steve Rowe's comment :\n\nSystem.nanoTime(), which is guaranteed to be monotonic, is now used to recored elapsed times. In several places, conversion from nano seconds to some target unit (e.g. seconds, milli seconds) is performed using hard-coded conversion constants, which is prone to mistakes. \n\nIt would be nice to use TimeUnit.TARGETUNIT.convert(sourceDuration, TimeUnit.SOURCEUNIT) instead.",

No its only full seconds. So better change to millies. This affects multiple places. "

I.e. if today we print %.1fs, we should continue to do that.\n\nAlso, those changes to MergeRateLimiter.java are very dangerously wrong...  secondsToPause cannot be safely cast to long: it's a double.
