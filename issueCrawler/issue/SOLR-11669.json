    "description": "Policy.Session is used in several places in the autoscaling framework. However, its life-cycle is unclear and inconsistent - in some places (ComputePlanAction) sessions are created directly via Policy.createSession, in other places a thread-local caching in PolicyHelper is used, in still other places the ObjectCache is used.\n\nSession creates a copy of live nodes on instantiation, which may become stale, but PolicyHelper caching never checks whether this instance is still valid while it's still in cache.\n\nAlso, refcounting leads to awkward and non-intuitive code, such AddReplicaCmd:103.",
