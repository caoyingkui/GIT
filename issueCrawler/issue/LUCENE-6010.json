It's actually not easy because often the code looks used from Clover since there is a unit test for it although nothing else uses it in the code base (like it was the case for OpenBitSet). But here is a new patch that removes more stuff:\n\n\tOpenBitSet\n{,DISI,Iterator}\n\tFilterDirectoryReader.StandardDirectoryWrapper\n\tDoubleBarrelLRUCache\n\tPackedInts.Header\n\tFST.ArcAndState\n\n ",

So that any code that's only directly called from src/test/* doesn't \"count\"... ",
