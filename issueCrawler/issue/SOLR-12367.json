    "description": "When adding a model that references a non-existent feature a very ambiguous error message is thrown, something like \"Model type does not exist org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LinearModel\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo reproduce, do not add any features and just add a model, for example by doing this:\n\n\u00a0\n\ncurl -XPUT 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/schema/model-store' --data-binary '\n\n{\n\n\u00a0 \"class\": \"org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LinearModel\",\n\n\u00a0 \"name\": \"myModel\",\n\n\u00a0 \"features\": [ {\"name\": \"whatever\" }],\n\n\u00a0 \"params\": {\"weights\": {\"whatever\": 1.0}}\n\n}' -H 'Content-type:application/json'\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe resulting error message \"Model type does not exist\u00a0org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LinearModel\" is extremely misleading and cost me a while to figure out the actual cause.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA more suitable error message should probably indicate the name of the missing feature that the model is trying to reference.",

The message will now say \"org.apache.solr.ltr.model.ModelException: Features cannot be null; perhaps check for missing features\". To reproduce, follow the same procedure as described in the description.\n\nFor now, I have not dealt with the\u00a0ClassCastException that shows up in the comment (i.e. upload features, then execute above) for casting a Long to a Double, however should this be deemed necessary, I can add that to the patch, or create another issue for it.\n\nThis should also close 12676, and (maybe?) 12676.\n\nAny comments would be appreciated.
