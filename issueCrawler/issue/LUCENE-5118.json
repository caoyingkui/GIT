    "description": "SpatialStrategy has this abstract method:\n\n/**\n   * Make a ValueSource returning the distance between the center of the\n   * indexed shape and {@code queryPoint}.  If there are multiple indexed shapes\n   * then the closest one is chosen.\n   */\n  public abstract ValueSource makeDistanceValueSource(Point queryPoint);\n\n\n\nI'd like to add another argument double multiplier that is internally multiplied to the result per document.  It's a convenience over having the user wrap this with another ValueSource, and it'd be faster too.  Typical usage would be to add a degrees-to-kilometers multiplier.\n\nThe current method could be marked deprecated with a default implementation that invokes the new one with a 1.0 multiplier.",

A minor ancillary thing I did was add equals & hashCode to BBox's AreaSimilarity which is important for cacheability of the ValueSource that contains it.\n\nI had second thoughts on deprecating the method without the multiplier so I didn't do that.\n\nWhat do you think Ryan McKinley?
