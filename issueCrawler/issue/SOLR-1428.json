            "content": "I thought this would be really easy to bang in the airport last week, and this patch is the initial stub of my attempt: it just adds the neccessary interface declarations and stub methods in the two parent classes \u2013 before resolving all of the actual classes should be updated with real names, descriptions, etc...)\n\nbut even with this patch i encountered a few problems...\n\n\n\tSolrInfoMBeanTest failes with this patch \u2013 the test assumes it can instantiate all classes it finds that are assignable to SolrInfoMBean, but this fails for most of the ValueSourceParsers which are anonymous inner classes.  this is a test failure, and could either be accounted for in the test, or we could make those ValueSOurceParsers real classes (the latter being my opinion as a good idea anyway)\n\tthe JSPs need to be updated to account for hte new Categories of SolrInfoMBeans (this is some brittle code anyway, definitely good to fix or rip out)\n\tthe new SolrInfoMBeans aren't getting registered in the infoRegistry.\n\n\n\nThe first two are straight forward \u2013 the last one confuses the hell out of me \u2013 the code exists in SolrResourceLoader to automaticly register any object it instantiates that implements SolrInfoMBeans, but for some reason it doesn't seem to be working.  it seems like a symptom of a bigger problem that needs to be investigated "
