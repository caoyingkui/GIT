    "description": "Cassandra Targett noticed as part of SOLR-11578 that we forgot to update the ref guide. Here is her comment:\n\nRohit, Erick Erickson, there are a number of changes to the Ref Guide (cloud-screens.adoc) that could have been made with this commit: updated screenshots, a description of the new type labels, and clean up of a section that discusses the Dump screen that no longer exists (not related to this change I think). Are these updates planned for a later time but before 7.5 is released?\n\nI may come back and ask about how to deal with images....",

I just use Preview on the Mac (Tools -> Adjust Size...IIRC I try to do 1024x768)\n\n2> Binary files don't go into the patch very well, want me to just push the changes and review then?\n\nWhy don't you go ahead and just commit your changes after trying to shrink the images and I'll take a look afterwards.
