    "description": "With LUCENE-5819, which adds ordinals support to block tree terms dict, it's in theory possible to create a codec that uses a single shared terms dict for both Sorted/SetDocValues and postings as long as the app \"promises\" that the given field(s) will always be indexed as both S/SDV and inverted.\n\nThe codec should ideally throw an exc if that promise was broken, instead of adding incorrect values to the index.\n\nThis would save RAM because at search time only one shared \"terms index\" is loaded, vs two today.  Of course the forward index for S/SDV (mapping doc -> term ords) must still be separately stored from the inverted postings (mapping term ord -> docs).",
