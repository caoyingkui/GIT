Mine is a bunch of POM skeletons that gathers the code from the Ant-structured SVN trunk so that one can use Maven to build, test and deploy (and itegrate with my development environment and all the other things it does for me).\n\nThere are most probably some problem with some test. Mavens test plugin require a bit of configuration to avoid all automagic things it does. The lucene-tests/pom.xml contains comments on that.\n\nlucene-demo shoudl probably be worked a bit more, it really only contains the source code that some other things depends on (tests mostly). Perhaps someone that knows webthings could fix the resource dir and all so it could build a deployable war-file or something. I don't know.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that can be a major pain is to apply a trunk patch that span multiple projects. Never had to do that though.\n\nIt is running smooth over here. \n ",

It now uses the maven ant tasks\n  to deploy the pom and jar files to a local repository located in dist/maven.\n\tAdded a new target \"dist-maven\" to contrib-build.xml that is only executed if\n  a pom.xml is present in the contrib dir. \n\tAdded the target \"generate-maven-artifacts\" to build.xml which calls \"m2-deploy\"\n  for the parent, core, demos, and contrib poms. Then it does a contrib crawl\n  with target \"dist-maven\".\n\n\n\nThis works quite well. However there are probably some things that can be \nsimplified or improved:\n\n\tI copy the pom.xml to the build dir first so that I can replace the @version@\n  placeholder with the actual value. There's probably a way to do this with\n  the maven ant tasks without having to copy the file first.\n\tThis might be a hack but I couldn't figure out a way to do this differently\n  yet: In the \"dist-maven\" target I read the parent, core and contrib pom.xml\n  using the <artifact:pom> task. I don't actually need to load those poms\n  but if I don't do it the build fails, because the contrib artifacts have the\n  \"lucene-contrib\" artifact as parent. Even if I specify the local repository\n  where those artifacts are located or if I add them as dependencies it doesn't\n  work. A hint here is appreciated.\n\tThe new lucene-checksum macro is not used yet for md5 computation of the\n  artifact files.\n\n\n\n\nI will spend more time on this patch during the next days for testing. Some feedback\nand help with testing is highly appreciated. It would also be helpful if the contrib\nowners could take a look at the particular pom.xml files.\n\nFor testing purposes I uploaded the artifacts generated by this patch to \nhttp://people.apache.org/~buschmi/staging_area/lucene ",
