    "description": "Hello,\n\nAs mentioned in previous exchanges, notably with Grant Ingersoll, I added some \nnew classes to the \"analysis\" package to meet the requirements of the feature \nrequest in Bugzilla (http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28182) \nand did some refactoring while I was under-the-hood. This is an overview of \nthe hierarchies per my changes:\n\n-Analyzer\n--CustomAnalyzer (new abstract class largely based on Grant's BaseAnalyzer) \u2013\nAbstractAnalyzer (new abstract class) ---RussianAnalyzer ---GermanAnalyzer \u2014\netc.\n\n-Tokenizer\n--CloneableTokenizer (new abstract class)\n---StandardTokenizer\n---CharTokenizer\n---CJKTokenizer\n---etc.\n\n-TokenFilter\n--CloneableTokenFilter (new abstract class) ---AbstractStemFilter (new \nabstract class) ----RussianStemFilter ----GermanStemFilter ----etc.\n\n-Stemmer (very simple new interface used in AbstractStemFilter) \u2013\nPorterStemmer --RussianStemmer --etc.\n\nIn the attached zip file there are 3 diff files (core.analysis, \nsandbox.analysis, and sandbox.analysis.snowball) and a zip containing the new \nclasses for org.apache.lucene.analysis in the lucene core. I tried to minimize \nthe irrelevant code changes (e.g. style, spaces, etc.) in the diffs while \nconforming to the code formatting guidelines outlined by Otis. I think there \nwere a number of classes in the \"analysis\" package that didn't conform so \nthese diffs may have a lot of noise as I reformatted those classe with my IDE, \nsorry  . If the diffs are too painful then let me know and I'll try to prune \nthem. \n\nIf there is a TODO list specific to Analyzers, are the below items on that \nlist?\n\n1) move German and Russian packages to sandbox (I think this is on the Lucene \nTODO list)\n2) Analyzer class renaming such that dynamic configuration could return \nclasses like Analyzer_ru, Analyzer_de, Analyzer_fr, etc. based on the class \nnaming scheme \"Analyzer_\n{Locale.toString}\n\"\n3) Documentation\n\nQuestion, comments, feedback, criticisms are all welcome......\n\nRegards,\nRBP\n\nPS - Thanks Grant!",
