    "description": "When loading BloomFilteringPostingsFormat from the SPI registry, it will have a null delegate by default. I think it would be more comfortable to make it wrap Lucene40PostingsFormat by default so that it can be used against lucene-core tests (ant -Dtests.postingsFormat=BloomFilter, currently fails with \"java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Error - org.apache.lucene.codecs.bloom.BloomFilteringPostingsFormat has been constructed without a choice of PostingsFormat\") or with Solr field types with minimal configuration (<fieldType ... postingsFormat=\"BloomFilter\" />).",
