    "description": "bin/solr config depends on the status from Config API calls to determine whether the operation succeeded, but apparently the Config API can return status 0 for failed operations.  As a result, bin/solr config will claim success.  For example, after running bin/solr start -c and bin/solr create -c mycoll:\n\n\n$PROMPT$ bin/solr config -c mycoll -z localhost:9983 -property FOOBAR -value BAZ\n[...]\nPOSTing request to Config API: http://192.168.1.12:8983/solr/mycoll/config\n{\"set-property\":{\"FOOBAR\":\"BAZ\"}}\nSuccessfully set-property FOOBAR to BAZ\n\n\n\nBut the FOOBAR property cannot be set via set-property, because it is not on the editable properties whitelist in EditableSolrConfigAttributes.json.\n\nThis is evident from the direct Config API call:\n\n\nPROMPT$ curl -X POST -d '{set-property:{FOOBAR:BAZ}}'\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":0,\n    \"QTime\":1},\n  \"errorMessages\":[{\n      \"set-property\":{\"FOOBAR\":\"BAZ\"},\n      \"errorMessages\":[\"'FOOBAR' is not an editable property\"]}],\n  \"WARNING\":\"This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future.\"}",

WDYT?\n\nI don't think it's a duplicate, because:\n\n\n\tThis issue is about the config api, and SOLR-11896 is about the core admin api; and\n\tThis issue is about improperly reporting a failed config api operation, but on SOLR-11896 the core admin api succeeds when it shouldn't because it ignores invalid params.\n\n\n\nDefinitely related though, in that both are silently misbehaving APIs.

A couple of other changes:\n\n\n\tFixed a couple of error formatting issues (missing interpolated values) in SolrConfigHandler.Command.applySetProps().\n\tSolrj's TestV2Request had to be modified to handle a config api failure it didn't know about (since status was 0): a collection is created multiple times using the same configset, and a new requesthandler (same name each time) is added via the config api, then the collection is deleted.  But the config overlay was retaining the previous request handler definition, so any following attempts to create the request handler fail since it already exists.  I changed the test to choose random names for the new request handler, so that they won't clash in the config overlay.\n\n\n\nCommitting shortly. ",
