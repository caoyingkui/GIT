    "description": "I have a\u00a0hierarchal data in index and requirements like 'match parent only if at least n\u00a0his children were matched'.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI\u00a0used to\u00a0solve it by combination of some lucene / solr tricks like 'frange' filtration by sum of matched children score, so it's doable\u00a0out of the box with some efforts right now. But\u00a0also it could be solved by\u00a0ToParentBlockJoinQuery extension\u00a0with new numeric parameter, tried to do it in attached patch.\u00a0\n\nNot sure if\u00a0this\u00a0should be in main branch, just put it here, maybe someone would have similar problems.",
