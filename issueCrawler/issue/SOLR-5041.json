    "description": "From my comment on SOLR-4997:\n\nI fixed a bug that I had introduced which skipped log recovery on startup for all leaders instead of only sub shard leaders. I caught this only because I was doing another line-by-line review of all my changes. We should have a test which catches such a condition.\n\nAdd a test which tests that leaders always recover from log on startup.",
