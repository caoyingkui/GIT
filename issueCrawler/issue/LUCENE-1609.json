    "description": "synchronized method ensureIndexIsRead in TermInfosReader causes contention under heavy load\n\nSimple to reproduce: e.g. Under Solr, with all caches turned off, do a simple range search e.g. id:[0 TO 999999] on even a small index (in my case 28K docs) and under a load/stress test application, and later, examining the Thread dump (kill -3) , many threads are blocked on 'waiting for monitor entry' to this method.\n\nRather than using Double-Checked Locking which is known to have issues, this implementation uses a state pattern, where only one thread can move the object from IndexNotRead state to IndexRead, and in doing so alters the objects behavior, i.e. once the index is loaded, the index nolonger needs a synchronized method. \n\nIn my particular test, this uncreased throughput at least 30 times.",

You can unsafely publish objects that have no internal state, or their state is consistent enough for you under any memory visibility/reordering effects. See working example of it in LUCENE-1607, Yonik's hash for interning strings.\n\nThe problem is that indexState guards indexTerms, indexInfos, indexPointers, which aren't volatile too and aren't guarded by the lock. It is possible that one thread does load these fields and then sets indexState = new IndexRead(), but another thread sees only the last write and dies with NPE.\n\nThe thing I don't get, is why do we want lazy loading here at all? Is there any usage for TermInfosReader that prevents it from initializing in constructor? ",

As log as you not also sychronize the state object change or make it volatile in Java 1.5 it will still not work. That was, what I meant.\nIn my opinion, this is not fixable in any case with these type of state objects, yes? ",

To handle that we could add a package private method to load the terms index, which only IW would call (we do something similar with the doc stores).  IW's synchronization ensures only one thread would call the method.\n\nIt would then not be necessary to check on every Term lookup whether the index was loaded.\n\nIn general I prefer up-front initialization when possible.  Ie, when I call IndexReader.open, it should do as much initializing as it can instead of deferring initialization until the first query. ",

We'd love to see a fix and we'd agree that up-front initialisation would work for us.\n\nAFAICT there are a number of other potential subtle concurrency issues with TermInfosReader:\n\n\n\tlack of final on fields - a number of fields (directory, segment, fieldInfos, origEnum, enumerators etc.) are never written to after construction and should be declared final for better publication semantics\n\tunsafe publication of indexDivisor and totalIndexInterval these fields are not written to under lock and in a worst-case could be unstable under use.\n\tclose() calls enumerators.set(null) which only clears the value for the calling thread.\n\n\n\nMaking the TermInfosReader more immutable would address some of these issues.\n\nAs far as the root problem goes, uncontended synchronisation is generally very fast, but significantly slows down once a lock becomes contended. The kind of pattern employed here (do something quite expensive but only once) is not an ideal use of synchronisation as it commonly leads to a contended lock, which remains a slow lock well after it is required*. That being said, it isn't easy to do correctly and performantly under 1.4. \n\n* An alternative approach is something like this LazyReference class, although this kind of thing really requires Java5 for full value.

(Other things, like populating FieldCache,\nloading norms, still happen on the first query of course...).\n\nA much better application fix is to simply limit the number of threads executing queries.\n\nWell... if your hardware has concurrency, is it really the case that\nLucene never gets in the way?

You can pass in -1 to disable\nloading of the index entirely (eg, IndexWriter does this when merging\nsegments).  I also added the param to IndexWriter.getReader, so you\ncan get an NRT reader w/ subsampled index terms.\n\nThis replaces the set/getTermInfosIndexDivisor methods (they are now\ndeprecated), ie you now must specify the divisor when opening the\nreader.  If these methods are called, an UnsupportedOperationException\nis thrown.  This is technically a break in back compat (previously you\ncould call it before the terms index was used, eg if no searches had\nbeen run) but I think we should make an exception here.  Very few\nusers make use of these expert methods, and having these users switch\nto specifying the index divisor up front is a small code change in\nexchange for removing all synchronization from the terms dict.\n\nI also made all attrs in TermInfosReader final, and there is no longer\nany synchronization.  To handle the case in IndexWriter, where a merge\nfirst opens a segment (which does not need the index) and then an NRT\nreader (or, applyDeletes) needs to share the same pooled reader and\nneeds the terms index, I added a PrivateTermsDict static class to\nSegmentReader.  This class just wraps a no-index-loaded\nTermInfosReader, which merging will use, and then can open a new\nindex-is-loaded TermInfosReader when/if needed. ",
