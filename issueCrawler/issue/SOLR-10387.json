            "content": "Ah, thanks. This may well be the recent test failures that I was about to try to track down. Figured it would be something to do with file separators. I just did a visual check and I think I've corrected the problems. All of the remaining references to forward slash are ZooKeeper paths which don't have this problem.\n\nI don't have access to Windows machines to test, so if you could do any or all of these it would be an enormous favor:\n\n1> try running \n\nant test  -Dtestcase=SolrCLIZkUtilsTest -Dtests.method=testCp -Dtests.seed=65C25EBE642D0428 -Dtests.slow=true -Dtests.locale=zh-CN -Dtests.timezone=Indian/Comoro -Dtests.asserts=true -Dtests.file.encoding=ISO-8859-1\n\nThat's the failing Jenkins test. I want it to fail for you too before the patch.\n\n2> Apply the patch I'll attach to this JIRA. It's against trunk but it should apply to 6x.\n\n3> run the test in <1> again, I want it to succeed.... \n\n4> run through the scenario I outlined in SOLR-10108 on 19-Feb (here are the steps, there's some more explanation on that JIRA):\n> Create a collection on Solr, any collection will do.\n> 'bin/solr zk cp -r zk:/ file:/some/dir -z localhost:2181'\n> Shut down Solr\n> Re-initialize ZK (wipe all the data)\n> 'bin/solr zk cp -r file:/some/dir/ zk:/ -z localhost:2181'\n> start Solr again\n> You should see everything just as it was before.\n\n5> take a quick look at the help screens for cp ('bin/solr.cmd zk -help' should do it).\n\nPlease feel free to attach a patch or just a corrected solr.cmd would be great too.\n\nThanks!\n ",

The first patch reads:\n\n    // If the dest ends in a file separator, it's a directory so append the last element of the src to it.    \n    if (dstName.endsWith(File.separator)) { // Dest is a directory.\n      int pos = srcName.lastIndexOf(File.separator);\n\nActually, looking at it some more the patch is wrong anyway, I'll upload another version. The old one worked for me since the local fs separator is '/'. The above now reads as below: \n\n    String dstSeparator = (dstIsZk) ? \"/\" : File.separator;\n    String srcSeparator = (srcIsZk) ? \"/\" : File.separator;\n\n    if (dstName.endsWith(dstSeparator)) { // Dest is a directory or non-leaf znode.\n      int pos = srcName.lastIndexOf(srcSeparator);\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, can you tell me a little more about how it fails?\n\nSorry for the run-around...\n ",

This is the last section in the method, the patch I just put up has this comment just above the code in question:\n\n// Single file ZK -> local copy where ZK is a leaf node\nThe test there is still \nif (dst.endsWith(\"/\") == false) dst += \"/\";\n\ngive me a minute to incorporate your test changes though.
