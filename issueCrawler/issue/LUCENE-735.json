    "description": "Simple tool to back-convert from lockless to pre-lockless file format\n\nThe changes for lockless commits (LUCENE-701 ) are fairly minor and so\ncreating a tool to convert a lockless format index back to a\npre-lockless format index is 1) fairly simple, and 2) useful at least\nfor brave souls who want to try lockless but have the freedom to roll\nback to Lucene 2.0, using the same index, if anything goes wrong.\n\nI will attach an initial patch.\n\nThis has not yet received extensive testing so please be extremely\ncareful if you use this in production!  I've only done minimal testing\nso far: using IndexFiles to produce an index under lockless,\nconverting it to pre-lockless, and then doing searches against that\nindex with 2.0.  More testing is clearly needed to ensure separate\ndeletes, separate norms, etc, are working correctly.\n\nThe tool prints details of what it did, eg:\n\n  >> java org.apache.lucene.index.ConvertPreLockless index\n\n  3 segments in index\n  segment 0: not compound file format\n    has deletions\n    rename _a_2.del to _a.del\n    no separate norms\n  segment 1: not compound file format\n    has deletions\n    rename _b_1.del to _b.del\n    no separate norms\n  segment 2: not compound file format\n    has deletions\n    rename _c_1.del to _c.del\n    no separate norms\n  wrote \"segments\" file\n  rename segments_8 to segments_8.old\n\nCaveats:\n\n\n\tTread very carefully!  Test first in a sandox, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\tMake sure you only run this tool on an index that is not in use by\n    any reader/writers, else you could have problems: the tool\n    currently does not acquire the write lock even though it's\n    modifying the index.\n\n\n\n\n\tOn Windows only: if your index has any un-referenced files (ie,\n    files that should have been deleted but were in use at the time)\n    at the time you run this tool, then they will never be deleted\n    (ie, pre-lockless Lucene won't know to delete them).",
