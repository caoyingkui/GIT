            "content": "Thanks Varun. I agree 30 seconds is less. Actually, I found that with HDFS the timeout was autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration (default 60s) + autoReplicaFailoverWaitAfterExpiration (default 30s). We deprecated autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration value but did not add it to the default autoReplicaFailoverWaitAfterExpiration. So the timeout should be 90 seconds at least. I think we should be conservative here and set this to a higher value, say 120s. ",
