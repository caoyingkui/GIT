    "description": "This would be a nice improvement for spell correction: currently a transposition counts as 2 edits,\nwhich means users of DirectSpellChecker must use larger values of n (e.g. 2 instead of 1) and \nlarger priority queue sizes, plus some sort of re-ranking with another distance measure for good results.\n\nInstead if we can integrate \"chapter 7\" of http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.16.652 \nthen you can just build an alternative DFA where a transposition is only a single edit \n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)\n\nAccording to the benchmarks in the original paper, the performance for LevT looks to be very similar to Lev.\n\nSupport for this is now in moman (https://bitbucket.org/jpbarrette/moman/) thanks to Jean-Philippe \nBarrette-LaPierre.",

I'll attach some files showing how the difference in the moman output changed ",
