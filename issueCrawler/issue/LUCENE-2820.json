    "description": "When you close IW, it waits for (or aborts and then waits for) all running merges.\n\nHowever, it's wait criteria is wrong \u2013 it waits for the threads to be done w/ their merges, not for the threads to actually die.\n\nCMS already has a sync() method, to wait for running threads, which we can call from CMS.close.  However it has a thread hazard because a MergeThread removes itself from mergeThreads before it actually exits.  So sync() is able to return even while a merge thread is still running.\n\nThis was uncovered by LUCENE-2819 on the test case TestCustomScoreQuery.testCustomExternalQuery, though I expect other test cases would show it.",
