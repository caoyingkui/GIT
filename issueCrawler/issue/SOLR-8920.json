We try to reserve JIRAs for code issues rather than usage issues.\n\nIn this case, termFreq is working exactly as it should. It returns information about terms that come out of your analysis chain. In this case the terms are something like \"white\", \"blood\" and \"cell\". There is no single term \"white blood cell\".\n\nWhen you ask your question on the user's list, please state the problem you're really trying to solve. Why do you want to count the occurrences of phrases? ",
