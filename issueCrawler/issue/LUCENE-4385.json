Created a dedicated IntelliJ module benchmark-conf to handle this situation, similarly to the solrj-test-files and solr-core-test-files modules.  Since IntelliJ doesn't like nested modules (except apparently the top-level module?), I moved the benchmark module to the lucene/benchmark/src/ directory, and placed the benchmark-conf module under lucene/benchmark/conf/.\n\n\n\nCommitting shortly.
