    "description": "The ConfigSolr object that holds configuration options for CoreContainer is currently represented as a DOM object, with various methods on it for pulling values out of the DOM tree or out of System properties.  This has a couple of drawbacks:\n1) it couples the configuration class directly to its representation on disk, which is a pain if we ever want to change it (say hello, old-style to new-style solr.xml upgrade!).\n2) the checking of system properties means that it's not threadsafe, which in turn means that all our cluster tests have to launch Jettys sequentially, rather than in parallel.  This results in tests taking about 25 seconds to start up, before any of the test logic has been run.\n\nWe should tidy this up.",
