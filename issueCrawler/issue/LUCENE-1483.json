    "description": "This issue changes how an IndexSearcher searches over multiple segments. The current method of searching multiple segments is to use a MultiSegmentReader and treat all of the segments as one. This causes filters and FieldCaches to be keyed to the MultiReader and makes reopen expensive. If only a few segments change, the FieldCache is still loaded for all of them.\n\nThis patch changes things by searching each individual segment one at a time, but sharing the HitCollector used across each segment. This allows FieldCaches and Filters to be keyed on individual SegmentReaders, making reopen much cheaper. FieldCache loading over multiple segments can be much faster as well - with the old method, all unique terms for every segment is enumerated against each segment - because of the likely logarithmic change in terms per segment, this can be very wasteful. Searching individual segments avoids this cost. The term/document statistics from the multireader are used to score results for each segment.\n\nWhen sorting, its more difficult to use a single HitCollector for each sub searcher. Ordinals are not comparable across segments. To account for this, a new field sort enabled HitCollector is introduced that is able to collect and sort across segments (because of its ability to compare ordinals across segments). This TopFieldCollector class will collect the values/ordinals for a given segment, and upon moving to the next segment, translate any ordinals/values so that they can be compared against the values for the new segment. This is done lazily.\n\nAll and all, the switch seems to provide numerous performance benefits, in both sorted and non sorted search. We were seeing a good loss on indices with lots of segments (1000?) and certain queue sizes / queries, but the latest results seem to show thats been mostly taken care of (you shouldnt be using such a large queue on such a segmented index anyway).\n\n\n\tIntroduces\n\t\n\t\tMultiReaderHitCollector - a HitCollector that can collect across multiple IndexReaders. Old HitCollectors are wrapped to support multiple IndexReaders.\n\t\tTopFieldCollector - a HitCollector that can compare values/ordinals across IndexReaders and sort on fields.\n\t\tFieldValueHitQueue - a Priority queue that is part of the TopFieldCollector implementation.\n\t\tFieldComparator - a new Comparator class that works across IndexReaders. Part of the TopFieldCollector implementation.\n\t\tFieldComparatorSource - new class to allow for custom Comparators.\n\t\n\t\n\tAlters\n\t\n\t\tIndexSearcher uses a single HitCollector to collect hits against each individual SegmentReader. All the other changes stem from this \n\t\n\t\n\tDeprecates\n\t\n\t\tTopFieldDocCollector\n\t\tFieldSortedHitQueue",

So, because we now make 100 pqueues, each gathering\ntop N results, we are paying much more insertion cost overall than the\nsingle queue that IndexSearcher(MultiReader) uses.\n\nSo.... how about still doing the searches per-sub-reader(searcher),\nbut, make a HitCollector that gathers the results into a single\npqueue, passing that HitCollector to each sub-searcher?\n\nIf that turns out OK, then I think it would make LUCENE-1471 moot\nbecause we should similarly change MultiSearcher to use a single\nshared pqueue.\n\nActually I think this approach should be a bit faster, because there\nis some very small method call overhead to how MultiReader implements\nTermDocs/Positions by \"concatenating\" its sub-readers.  So by pushing\nSearcher down onto each SegmentReader we should gain a bit, but it\ncould very well be in the noise.  For this reason we may in fact want\nto do this same thing for the \"normal\" (sort by relevance)\nIndexSearcher.search.\n\nI wish I thought of this sooner.  Sorry for the runaround Mark! ",

I also added TopFieldValueDocCollector (extends DocCollector),\nand ByValueFieldSortedHitQueue (extends PriorityQueue) that interacts\nwith the FieldComparators.  (We can change these names...).

I verified for the test sort alg (above) it's producing the\nright results (at least top 40 docs match).\n\nI didn't expect such performance gain (I was hoping for not much\nperformance loss, actually).

It seems we keep accidentally discovering performance gains\nhere \n\nIf we go forward with this approach I think it'd mean deprecating\nFieldSortedHitQueue & ScoreDocComparator, because I think there's no\nback-compatible way to migrate forward.  I also like that this\napproach means we only need an iterator interface to FieldCache\nvalues (for LUCENE-831).\n\nMark can you look this over and see if it makes sense and maybe try to\ntackle the other sort types?

When transitioning readers you have\nto remap all ords to the new reader (but keep the value unchagned):\nfor each slot, you take its String value look it up in the new reader\nw/ binary search.

You compare with ords, never with values.\n\nThe one caveat is... we have to take care with precision.  A float\nX+0.5 won't be precise enough.  We could use double, or, we could use\nlong and \"remap\" all valid ords to be 2X (even) their value, and all\n\"in between\" ords (carried over from previous reader) to be odd\nvalues.

Also, when using an ord for (b), it doesn't have to be exact - it can be rounded since it's purpose isn't an exact comparison, but just an optimization to determine if insertion into the priority queue can be skipped.

I don't think ords will get faster though (you wouldnt surprise me though), I think they will get slower. Certainly they should stay much faster than value though - what a dog. But who knows - we can test fall back to value compare instead of subords as well. My naive ords attempt now is keeping previous mapping ords order by multiplying it as we move to new readers - thats going to explode into some very large numbers pretty fast, and I don't expect we can get by so easily. Either fall back to value will be good enough, or we will prob have to map to new ords rather than simple multiplying to retain each stages ording.\n\nI'll keep playing with the ord on my end though - i only got it to pass those tests moments before that patch went up. I try to keep a frantic pace because I never know if my spare cycles will go away - I have juggled a defensive plate for a while  No doubt I'll squeeze some more hours tonight though.  ",

So your logic (negate then subtract 2) makes perfect sense now.\n\nJust be sure... maybe you should temporarily add asserts when a negative index is returned that values[-index-2].compareTo(newValue) < 0 and values[-index-1] > 0 (making sure those array accesses are in bounds)?\n\n\n> (I dont remember off hand why subord has to start at 1 not 0, but i remember it didnt work otherwise)\n\nThis is very important \u2013 that 1 is \"equivalent\" to the original 0.5 proposal, ie, think of subord as the 2nd digit in a 2-digit number.  That 2nd digit being non zero is how we know that even though banana's ord landed on apple's, banana is in fact not equal to apple (because the subord for banana is > 0) and is instead between apple and orange.

You mean if you pass in allowDocsOutOfOrder=true (defaults to false).\n\nI think this should not be a problem?  (Though, I really don't fully understand BooleanScorer!).  Since we are running scoring per-segment, each segment might collect its docIDs out of order, but all such docs are still within the current segment.  Then when we advance to the new segment, the collector can do something if it needs to, and then collection proceeds again on the next segment's docs, possibly out of order.

So it scores docs 0-16k first, then docs 16-32k, etc. For each window it iterates through all query terms and accumulates a score in table[doc%16k].  It also stores in the table a bitmask representing which terms contributed to the score.  Non-zero scores are chained in a linked list.  At the end of scoring each window it then iterates through the linked list and, if the bitmask matches the boolean constraints, collects a hit.  For boolean queries with lots of frequent terms this can be much faster, since it does not need to update a priority queue for each posting, instead performing constant-time operations per posting.  The only downside is that it results in hits being delivered out-of-order within the window, which means it cannot be nested within other scorers.  But it works well as a top-level scorer.  The new BooleanScorer2 implementation instead works by merging priority queues of postings, albeit with some clever tricks.  For example, a pure conjunction (all terms required) does not require a priority queue.  Instead it sorts the posting streams at the start, then repeatedly skips the first to to the last.  If the first ever equals the last, then there's a hit.  When some terms are required and some terms are optional, the conjunction can be evaluated first, then the optional terms can all skip to the match and be added to the score.  Thus the conjunction can reduce the number of priority queue updates for the optional terms.  Does that help any? ",

I was suggesting that, if we're going to have two APIs, one expert and one non-expert, then we could make the expert API a subclass and not deprecate or otherwise alter HitCollector.  I do not like using exceptions for normal control flow.  Instanceof is better, but not ideal.

ridiculous amount of of data to digest... but here are some\ninitial thoughts:\n\n\n\tThese are only single term queries; I'd expect for multi term\n    queries the gain would be less since net/net less %tg of the time\n    is spent collecting.\n\n\n\n\n\tOrd + val fallback (ordval) is generally faster than pure\n    ord/subord.  I think for now we should run with ord + val\n    fallback?  (We can leave ord + subord commented out?).\n\n\n\n\n\tIt's great that we see decent speedups for \"sort by score\" which\n    is presumably the most common sort used.\n\n\n\n\n\tWe do get slower in certain cases (neg pctg in the rightmost\n    column): all not-in-the-noise slowdowns were with query \"147\" on\n    the 100 segment index.  This query hits relatively few docs (~5K)\n    So, this is expected, because the new approach spends some time\n    updating its queue for each subreader.  If the time spent\n    searching is relatively tiny then this queue update time becomes\n    relatively big.  I think with larger queue size the slowdown will\n    be worse.  However, I think this is an acceptable tradeoff.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe gains for field sorting on a single segment (optimized) index\n    are impressive.  Generally, the more hits encountered the better\n    the gains.  It's amazing that we see ~67.8% gain sorting by docID,\n    country, and title for alldocs query.  My only guess for this is\n    better cache hit rate (because we gain locality by copying values\n    to local compact arrays).\n\n\n\n\n\tAcross the board the alldocs query shows very sizable (5X faster\n    for 100 segment index; 3X faster for 10 segment index)\n    improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\tI didn't break out %tg difference, but warming time with the patch\n    is waaaay faster than trunk when index has > 1 segment.  Reopen\n    time should also be fantastically faster (we are sidestepping\n    something silly happing w/ FieldCache on a Multi*Reader).  Warming\n    on trunk takes ~95 seconds with the 100 segment index!\n\n ",

I wonder how often users of Lucene set a very large queue size\n(to do some sort of post filtering, which could be more efficiently\ndone as a real Filter, but...).  I think it may a non-trivial number,\nso... what to do?\n\nEG we could offer a different collector that's better optimized\ntowards collecting a large topN (probably doing the toplevel\nFieldCache that's done today)?  Or, we could explore a hybrid approach\nwhereby a slot is only switched to the current segment when it's first\nvisited again (instead of updating all of them on switching readers)?\nOr... something else?

You have switched it to values.length - here is what I'm thinking: In the case where 3 hits come from a Reader, but you ask for 1000 back, that will run through that loop 1000 times, but you only need to convert 3 right? This is what I was attempting - what test are you running to see the failure? The idea for me was that if you only have 20 hits so far on a top 1000 search, you only need to hit that loop to convert 20 values to the new Reader, rather 1000 everytime (though you spin fast hitting the ==null). I'm not sure - xmas shopping has burned my whats left of my brain cells. I'll let it stew, perhaps run some code, and come back. ",

During the \"startup transient\" (when\ncollector has not yet seen enough hits to fill its queue), the slot\nindeed increases one at a time, and you could at that point use it to\nefficiently visit only the used slots.\n\nHowevever, after startup transient, the pqueue will then track the\nweakest entry in the queue, which can occur in any of the slots, and\nwhen a hit that beats that weakest entry arrives, it will call copy()\ninto that slot.\n\nSo the slot passed to copy is now a \"relatively random\" value.  For a\n1000 sized queue whose slots are full, you might get a copy into slot\n242.  In this case we were incorrectly setting \"this.slot\" to 242 and\nthen only converting the first 242 entries.\n\nIf we changed to to track the maxSlot it should work... but I'm not\nsure this is worthwhile, since it only speeds up already super-fast\nsearches and slightly hurts slow searches.

Would that work?\n\nI think this could work well. Since you are likely to have a few large segments, ord would be fastest, then as you moved through the many small segments, orddem would likely work best. Is largest to smallest best though? You do get to map onto smaller term[] arrays as you go, but that causes more fallback. You are also likely to be carrying more hits in the queue into the nextreader right? From smallest to largest you likely have fewer hits to map as you hit the big segments, and more room to fit in for less fallback. So the question is, what obvious piece am I missing \n\nLargest to smallest, you fill the queue faster earlier. So more to convert as you hit all the other segments - but I guess that will be heavily mitigated by on demand.. You will convert slot.min, and if nothing beats it, I guess thats it...so not so bad actually. And if you go smallest to largest, I guess the queue wont be full, so there will be more 'wins' into the queue, which will cause more conversions over the small segments...in which case for a ton of them and a big queue, largest to smallest seems better. Still feel like I'm missing something, but I guess I have convinced myself largest to smallest is the way to go.\n\nI'm probably not the first to wish there were more hours in the day...\n\nI'll put up a patch with the better testing soon just in case.\n\n\n ",

Though, modern CPUs are quite good when an if-statement consistently goes one way, so it could be a single comparator that does internal switching might perform fine.  Still, if we fix the API to return a new comparator, we can then allow both options.\n\nI think in some cases we'd even fall back to VAL comparison.\n\n\n>  Is largest to smallest best though?\n\nGood question; it's not obvious.  We should try both, and perhaps allow for the collector to optionally specify the order.\n\nMy thinking was the first large segment using ORD is \"free\" (because ORD is only costly on switching segments).  If there are many hits, likely the queue has done most of the work it'll do (ie, the majority of the total # insertions will have been done), unless search is \"degenerate\".  Perhaps the second segment, if large, warrants ORD, but them sometime soonish you'd switch to ORDDEM or VAL.\n\nThe \"long tail\" of tiny segments would then normally be zipped through w/ hardly any insertions, so a higher insertion cost (with zero segment transition cost) is OK.\n\nBut you're right: if we do the tiny segments first, then the queue would be small so transition cost is lower.\n\nWe should make it simple to override a method to implement your own \"search plan\", and then provide a default heuristic that decides when to switch comparators.  Probably that default heuristic should be based on how often compare was actually invoked for the segment.  EG if the String sort is secondary to a numeric sort then even if there are many hits, if the numeric sort mostly wins (doesn't have many compare(...) == 0's) then the String sort should probably immediately switch to VAL after the first segment.

Or, we may keep some of them around for \"expert\" usage.  I still think it'd be very helpful if one could alter a static array or something in TestSort to list the STRING sort methods to test out, and TestSort runs entirely with each method; then if one is making a private method one could stick it into the test to make sure it works.  Making a functionally correct STRING sort method is proving to be quite a challenge!\n\nOK I'll test the new patch... thanks Mark! ",

I wouldn't expect one segment as straight ord would be much of a gain, but I am surprised it doesn't at least edge out the transition cost. Policy 2 is even worse - likely the arbitrary switch to on demand is not very useful - on the large queues it appears better to just orddem the whole thing. Perhaps it should switch sooner, or use a better heuristic. You gave some good ideas for that above, but I don't think thats a quick get.\n\nNeed to try and re micro bench little experiments to get an idea of what to do I think...\n\nI hope something smarter can eek out more gains than that.

Still some problems here and there (large queue size still sticky), but overall some solid gains as well.\n\norddem seems to be best in most cases currently - maybe we can tweak that a little more somehow. Where its not better, or not much worse, is with a single segment. That result is interesting, because both policies beat it nicely, and its because they simpely use straight ord on the first segment. But ordsubord seems to outperform the policies. That doesn't make sense. Its largely the same, but should be a tad slower if anything. Other results match up so nicely, it seems like it might not be noise, in which case, weird. ",

Also, when converting, it\n    bounds the binarySearch by using bottomOrd.  This seems to give\n    better performance in the high-segment-count, large-queue-size,\n    few hits cases, and comparable performance in other cases.\n\n\n\nI think for a custom sort we should allow user to pass in a ComparatorPolicy?

ORDDEM2 is fastest on the first segment because all ORDs are comparable.  I think this'll matter most for indexes that have many deletions, such that the old large segments contain many deletes (in which case they are sorted later). ",

Pretty efficient. Do it for each term to be loaded.\n\nTo load a FieldCache for multiple segments we get a MultiSegmentReader to get  MultiTermDocs.

The MultiSegment seek for each term is pretty much free, so I dont count that, but you seek on each term for each individual segment as you call next on the TermDocs.

One seek for each reader for each term.\n\nHowever, it still appears that we get to do WAY fewer seeks this way - for my last example, maybe like 40000 seeks. Quite a bit better than 1.5 million. But why?\n\nPerhaps its because we can use only the terms from each segment. Then, rather than num readers X total unique terms seeks, you have the sum of unique terms per index seeks. That could count for a lot of saved seeks, but I am not sure that it accounts for all of them (1.5 mil to 40,000 is quite the drop). Beyond all the saved seeks though, I imagine its more efficient to hit the same reader n times, than to hit each reader round robin n times.

So it makes sense then - for every segment with few terms in it, all of the unique terms for the whole index get checked against it. A segment with even 1 term will be hit against for every unique term in the whole index. Thats what was happening in this case, as its like a logarithmic drop.

In my test environment I got no errors/exception etc. After tests, I set it online on my productive system (I will look into the error logs of the webserver for exceptions).\n\nThe speed increase of a sorted search after a reopen of the index (600,000 docs), that only added some documents into a new cfs segment, is incredible. In the past, the warmup for filling the field cache was about 3 seconds - now it shows up without any recognizable time. So no warmup after reopen is needed anymore.\n\nOne thing I noticed when compiling my code against the new lucene-core.jar:\nTop(Field)Docs deprecated the method getMaxScore(). Why is this so? To display search results with a score normalized to 1.0, you need to divide by the maximum score. The docs say, you should implement your own HitCollector (why that, I want to use TopDocs?), but why does TopDocs deprecate the maximum score? OK, for relevance/score sorted TopDocs, this is no problem, as the maximum score is in ScoreDoc[0], but for docs sorted by fields (which extends TopFieldDoc), you need the max score. If you have generic search code that does not distinguish between TopDocs and TopFieldDocs, the generic code is to divide by TopDocs.getMaxScore().\n\nI am happy, +1 for commiting. But let getMaxScore live after Lucene 3.0! ",

            "content": "Hi again,\nI found a small problem with getSequentialReaders() and your recursion. In my opinion, the whole problem is the way, how getSequentialReaders() is defined in IndexReader.\n\nFirst the problem:\nIf you create an MultiReader consisting of only one IndexReader (this can be the case if you supply 3 indexes in a user interface and the user can check them for searching. If the user only checks one, the MultiReader will contain one). The recursion in IndexSearcher.gatherSubReaders() stops, when the count is 1. If this one reader is a unoptimized index (a MultiSegmentReader), the sub-readers are not gathered.\n\nIn my opinion, I would do it in another way:\na) rename getSequentialReaders() into getSubReaders(). IndexReader.getSubReaders returns an empty array or null (because it has no sub readers). Multi(Segment)Reader returns the sub-readers.\nb) gatherSubReaders then looks like this:\n\n  protected void gatherSubReaders(List allSubReaders, IndexReader r) {\n    IndexReader[] subReaders = r.getSubReaders();\n    if (subReaders == null || subReaders.length == 0) {\n      allSubReaders.add(r);\n    } else {\n      for(int i=0;i<subReaders.length;i++) {\n        gatherSubReaders(allSubReaders, subReaders[i]);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, this is the cleaner way. Returning a one-entry-array containing itsself in getSequentialReader() is not clean and can lead to endless loops if used wrongly. ",

Nevertheless, for local-only applications, the new IndexSearcher is preferable over a MultiSearcher with separate IndexSearchers for each index.\n\nAn improvement of the current ParallelMultiSearcher could be, as mentioned before, to use the new sorting by doc count of all subreaders implemented by gatherSubReaders in the new IndexSearcher together with a maxThreads property. The new ParallelIndexSearcher could spawn max threads for the first (and biggest) n index readers in the list and one for the rest. The search could then done in parallel. This solves the problem of the current ParallelMultiSearcher spawning too many threads (because there is no limitation). The new one could only parallelize the search inside bigger indexes (this is just an idea). Note: This ParallelIndexSearcher would not get separate Searchables as c'tor parameter, but one IndexReader like IndexSearcher. The parallelization is only done based on all sub-readers.

            "content": "My previous comment:\n\nI tracked down how this patch was causing Solr failures:\n\nExternalFileField in Solr maps from a uniqueKey to a float value from a separate file.\nThere is a cache that is essentially keyed by (IndexReader,field) that gives back a float[].\n\nAny change in the index used to cause all values to be updated (cache miss because the MultiReader was a different instance). Now, since it's called segment-at-a-time, only new segments are reloaded from the file, leaving older segments with stale values.\n\nIt's certainly in the very gray area... but perhaps Solr won't be the only one affected by this - maybe apps that implement security filters, etc?\n\nYonik, why was the failure so intermittent? \n\nIt failed for others but not for me due to a Solr bug that prevented IndexReader.reopen() from being used on Windows.\nAs to why it reportedly worked for Mark when he built Lucene himself.... <shrug>... at this point perhaps testing error.\n\n[...]\n\nLucene implicitly assumes that a FieldCache's arrays do not change for\na given segment; this is normally safe since the arrays are derived\nfrom the postings in the field (which are write once).\n\nBut it sounds like Solr changed that assumption, and the values in the\n(Solr-subclass of) FieldCache's arrays are now derived from something\nexternal, which is no longer write once.\nRight... it used to hold in solr because nothing really operated below the MultiReader level.\nThe intention is that at the time when a new IndexReader is opened, the entire file is read.\nThis patch changes that up.\n\n\nHow do you plan to fix it with Solr? It seems like, since you are\nmaintaining a private cache, you could forcefully evict entries from\nthe cache for all SegmentReaders whenever the external file has\nchanged (or a new MultiSegmentReader had been opened)?\n\nIt's not so easy... the same segment could be associated with two different active MultiReaders (with a different set of values for each).  When the scorer is created, only the SegmentReader is passed with no other context. ",

The worst thing is that they often will come in index order... and only break later on under certain circumstances.\n\nWe could add a flag to methods that take a hit collector, but that would require keeping two lists of Segments (sorted and original) and corresponding bases.

At the end of my collection, I used to pass the results through a FieldSortedHitQueue of the proper size to get sorted results. The problem now is that FieldValueHitQueue takes an array of subreaders instead of one IndexReader. As far as I can tell, there's no way for me to get a proper sorted array of subreaders for an IndexReader without copying and pasting the gatherSubReaders and sortSubReaders methods from IndexSearcher. This isn't desirable, so could IndexSearcher perhaps provide some sort of getSortedSubReaders() method?
