I don't know the smartcn analyzer well enough though so I'd like someone else to double check the patch, maybe Robert Muir ? ",

            "content": "Patch looks good but i would change two things:\n\nThe constant SURROGATE_PAIR should just be renamed SURROGATE (since its a char and not an int).\nThe change to HHMMSegmenter,getCharTypes() to walk codepoints seems confusing, because it means the returned array would have some slots uninitialized (and CharType 0 = DELIMITER). I don't think this method needs to walk codepoints, it can just call getCharType() on every char like before. ",
