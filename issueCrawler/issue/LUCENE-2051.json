    "description": "Some analyzers in contrib provide setters for stopword / stem exclusion sets / hashtables etc. Those setters should be deprecated as they yield unexpected behaviour. The way they work is they set the reusable token stream instance to null in a thread local cache which only affects the tokenstream in the current thread. Analyzers itself should be immutable except of the threadlocal. \n\nwill attach a patch soon.",

Any one analyzer should really just serve as an example of how to put tokenstreams together.\nThey shouldn't try to meet all users needs, but instead be very simple and easy for the user to customize.\n\nThis complexity caused by setters was painful when implementing reusableTokenStream, these setters require special handling and code complexity.\nand there might even still be some bug I introduced in this process, we try our best but these setters make life very complex.\n\nI would like to see these setters deprecated for 3.0 so that code will be simpler in the future.

I want to have all sets in analyzers to be unmodifiable and an instance of ChararraySet. Further they shoud be a real copy as otherwise they could be modified by the caller of the Analyzer ctor. Thats why I introduced this helper as such code was duplicated all over the place.\n\nnothing to do with your issue, but maybe while we are here cleaning up these ctors we should fix the fact that a lot of these never call super() ?\n\nJava guarantees that the default super ctor is called implicitly. I would not add all this noise (calling it explicitly)  just for the sake of typing super() 20 times.\n\nThoughts? ",
