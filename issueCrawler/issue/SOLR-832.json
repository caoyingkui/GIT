    "description": "The rows parameter is not honored in non-debug mode.\n\tDuring debug mode, the rows parameter for a new request resets the old value. Therefore, the import will abort immediately, if rows is not specified on a subsequent request and if the original value for rows was greater than the default (10).\n\n\n\nThe first one is an enhancement and the second is a major bug. The fix for both is very related and it is best to handle both in the same issue.",
