            "content": "This smells like a caching related bug ... but i have no idea why/where.\n\nThe test does multiple iterations where in each iteration it builds an index of a random number of documents, each containing an incremented value for \"id\" and \"val_i\" \u2013 the number of documents can range from 1 to 21, with the id and val_i fields starting at \"0\".  Then it generates a bunch of random requests consisting of random q and fq params.\n\nThis is what the failing request looks like...\n\n\nq  = {!frange v=val_i l=0 u=1 cost=139 tag=t}\nfq = {!frange v=val_i l=0 u=1}\nfq = {! cost=92}-_query_:\"{!frange v=val_i l=1 u=1}\" \nfq = {!frange v=val_i l=0 u=1 cache=true tag=t}\nfq = {! cache=true tag=t}-_query_:\"{!frange v=val_i l=1 u=1}\"\n\n\n\nSo basically: it will only ever match docs which have val_i==0 \u2013 which given how the index is built means it should always match exactly 1 document: the 0th doc \u2013 but in the failure message we can see that it doens't match any docs.\n\n(FWIW: adding some debugging indicates that in the iteration where this fails, the index only has 2 documents in it \u2013 doc#0 and doc#1)\n\nIn this patch i'm attaching, I hacked the test to explicitly attempt the above query in every iteration, regardless of the num docs in the index, immediately after building the index \u2013 and that new assertion never fails.  but then after it passes, it continues on with the existing logic, to generating a bunch of random requests and executing them \u2013 and when it randomly generates the same query as above (that already succeeded in matching 1 doc against the current index) that query then fails to match any docs.\n\nwhich smells to me like some sort of filter caching glitch .. right?

I'll investigate a bit more later today \u2013 starting with trying to simplify the params to the barest case that still fails.\n "

I tried applying this patch to trunk, 4x, 4.6.0, 4.5.0, and 4.4.0 \u2013 all of them failed except 4.4, leading me to the working hypothesis that the changes in SOLR-5057 caused this problem.\n\nWhen i reverted r1516299 on my trunk checkout, both my new test and the original failing test (with the above mentioned reproduce line) started to pass.\n\n\n\nSo it seems pretty clear to me that something related to SOLR-5057 is causing false cache hits \u2013 what isn't entirely clear to me yet is if the functionality added in r1516299 is fundamentally flawed (and should be reverted), or if it's just exposing some less obvious problem with the hashCode/equals methods of these specific query types.\n\nI'll keep digging - but if anyone can lend a pair of eyes to the logic in r1516299 and chime in if you spot any fallacies it would be appreciated.
