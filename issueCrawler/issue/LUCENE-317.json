The reason is that\nthe attempt to call writeLock.release() fails because writeLock is null.\nTo correct this, just check for this case before releasing. A (trivial) patch is\nattached.",

If you have a look at the\nimplementation of IndexWriter, the writeLock member is created and assigned\nwithin the constructor.\n\nLock writeLock = directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.WRITE_LOCK_NAME);\nif (!writeLock.obtain(WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT)) // obtain write lock\n   throw new IOException(\"Index locked for write: \" + writeLock);\nthis.writeLock = writeLock;   \n\nSo the only possible chance that it isn't assigned and has a null value, is when\nthe IOException is thrown.\n\nthanks\nBernhard ",

Sorry for causing\nunnecessary effort, I should have looked into the issue more thoroughly. Anyway,\nIMHO closing a Writer more than once should do no harm, so the patch may still\nbe considered as enhancement. ",
