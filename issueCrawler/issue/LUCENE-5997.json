            "content": "Surely \"affects version 4.10\" is just a mistake: take a look at what the code does in 4.10.\n\nI agree: nuke it for 5.0, but the reason it has been \"doing nothing\" for years is because its not \"doing nothing\", but presumably still supporting backwards compatibility for 5-year-old indexes (3.0.x).\n\nCurrently, both indexes and analysis chains from 3.0 have to be supported all the way up to 5.0, which leaves a good deal of backwards compat cruft around for years and years and years.
