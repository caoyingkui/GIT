    "description": "Today, unless the version name contains '-SNAPSHOT', the documentation will generate javadocs with external links, e.g. http://lucene.apache.org/core/.\n\nFor the same reasons given in SOLR-8353 (for jar checksums), it would be nice to support specifying a regex to support internal links for versions that do not contain '-SNAPSHOT'.  An example from SOLR-8353:\n\nsome of us have a fork of the build that has to deal with changing dependencies. Our build systems all get to work according to their needs - which is a good thing.",
