            "content": "Here's the provider implementation with tests. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CurrencyField for documentation. Highlights:\n\n\n\tUses open, free exchange rates REST API\n\tPlugs into CurrencyField in schema.xml\n\tCan load rates json from any URL or through ResourceLoader\n\tConfigurable refresh of rates, enforces max every 60 min (since that's the update rate of the API)\n\n\n\nThis patch also changes the ExchangeRateProvider interface slightly:\n\n\tInstead of listCurrencies() returning FROM,TO pairs (which would be 25.000 lines for all available pairs for this provider, it takes an argument, so that listCurrencies(false) returns a list of supported currencies, while listCurrencies(true) returns list of pairs\n\n\n\nKnown limitations/questions:\n\n\tThe reflection for the providerClass param uses Class.forName() to instantiate the provider. But then the solr.MyClass alias does not work. How to solve this?\n\tIs the correct location o.a.s.schema for these providers or should we make a new package somewhere else?\n\n "
