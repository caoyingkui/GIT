I believe under SolrCloud... perhaps further under \"How SolrCloud Works\" since this document is an overview of how TRAs work.  So I need to do that still.\n\nWith the addition of this page, I think I should trim down some of the explanatory details in collections-api.adoc#CREATEALIAS that has a paragraph on how TRAs work, and instead have that part refer to this page.

Goal mostly was to make it so someone skipping around in the docs and not reading linearly from start to end would be better able to consume the parts and also I decided to use the term \"segment\" to refer to the time interval represented by a collection in the TRA, which I thought added some clarity by relating things to \"slices\" of time without using the term \"slice\" which has meaning/usage in other contexts already.
