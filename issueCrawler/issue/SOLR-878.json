    "description": "Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke/) is a great tool to help debug understand what is happening in lucene.  \n\nAlthough luke has a nice webstart app, since solr uses various snapshot builds of lucene, it is sometimes difficult to keep the versions consistent.  \n\nI propose we add an ant task that will download and run luke with the proper jars/classpath.",
