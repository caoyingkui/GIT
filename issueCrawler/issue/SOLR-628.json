    "description": "didn't get any reply to this in email, filing as bug to make sure it's dealt with before 1.3 release (either by fixing documentation, or by fixing bug \u2013 still not sure what the problem is)\n\n\nDate: Fri, 13 Jun 2008 11:41:26 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Chris Hostetter\nTo: solr-user\nSubject: QueryElevationComponent and forceElevation=true ?\n\n\nI don't know much about QueryElevationComponent but perusing the wiki docs and trying\nit out with teh example configs i noticed that this URL didn't produce the output i\nexpected...\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/elevate?q=ipod&fl=id,price&sort=price+asc&forceElevation=true&enableElevation=true&debugQuery=true\n\n..as far as i can tell, the forceElevation=true should cause \"MA147LL/A\" to always\napear at the top, regardless of the sort \u2013 but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAm I reading the docs wrong, or is this a bug?",
