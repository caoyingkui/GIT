According to Core Discovery (4.4 and beyond) a property instanceDir is available to set the instance directory for the configured core.\nOn start up of SOLR instanceDir is always set to the parent directory of core.properties.\nSetting a complete path to schema.xml and solrconfig.xml via schema and config properties won't help as every relative path is resolved against the wrong (unconfigurable) instanceDir and not against schema.xml.",

For the time being you'll have to copy the data to each discovered core.\n "
