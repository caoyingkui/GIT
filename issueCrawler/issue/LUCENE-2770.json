    "description": "This is a spin-off from LUCENE-2769:\n\nCurrently SegmentMerger has some optimizations when it merges segments that are SegmentReaders (e.g. when doing normal indexing or optimizing). But when you do IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader...) the listed IndexReaders may not really be per-segment. SegmentMerger should track down all passed in reads down to the lowest level (Segment)Reader (or other atomic readers like SlowMultiReaderWrapper) and then merge. We can then remove most MultiFields usage (except term merging itsself) and clean up the code.\n\nThis especially saves lots of memory for merging norms, as no longer the duplicate norms arrays are created when MultiReaders are used!",

Further optimizations here could also work per segment. For now we have to keep them \"atomic\".\n\nAs a side note: Why is contrib/misc's IndexSorter missing in trunk? ",

But I add it here, because for consistency we need it.\n\nThis patch also removes the useless closeReaders() method in SegmentMerger. This was used by tests only (incorrectly) and should never be called from production code. ",
