However, the implementation is pretty brittle and difficult to extend.\n\nIt is conceivable that any implementation of DirectoryFactory might have MInfoBeans that it would like to expose, so we should explicitly accommodate that instead of relying on a side effect of the SolrResourceLoader's behaviour.",
