    "description": "If you group by a field, the response may look like this:\n<lst name=\"grouped\">\n<lst name=\"series\">\n<int name=\"matches\">138</int>\n<int name=\"ngroups\">1</int>\n<result name=\"doclist\" numFound=\"138\" start=\"0\">\n<doc>\n<int name=\"id\">267038365</int>\n<str name=\"name\">\nLarry's Grand Ole Garage Country Dance - Pure Country\n</str>\n</doc>\n</result>\n</lst>\n</lst>\n\nand if you specify group.main then the doclist becomes the result and you lose all context of the number of groups. If you want to keep your response format backwards compatible with clients (i.e. clients who don't know about the grouped format), setting group.main=true solves this BUT the numFound is the number of raw matches instead of the number of groups. This may have downstream consequences.\n\nI'd like to propose that if the user specifies ngroups=true then when creating the returning DocSlice, set the numFound to be the number of groups instead of the number of raw matches to keep the response consistent with what the user would expect.",

Not a result of the 4310 patch nor pertinent to 4310's purpose, just something we discovered.\n\nOn a single core with group.limit > 1 and group.main, setting rows=10 will return 10 documents. A distributed setup with the same params will return 10 groups. A commented-out failing testcase is included in the patch. If others can confirm it, we can open a new JIRA ticket for it. "
