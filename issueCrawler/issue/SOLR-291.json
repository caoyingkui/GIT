    "description": "WHAT:\nA flag \"noCacheIfLarger\" is added to <queryResultWindowSize/> tag, i.e. <queryResultWindowSize noCacheIfLarger=\"true\">50</queryResultWindowSize>. The flag can be omitted and the default is false.\n\nIf this flag is set to true and user requires more results (in this case, start>=50), SolrIndexSearcher doesn't put the docList into queryResultCache.\n\nWHY(USE CASE):\nThe Solr administrator can calculate max memory consumption for filterCache and documentCache as follows:\n\nfilterCache: BitDocSet size * max size (cache entries)\ndocumentCache: average document size * max size (cache entries)\n\nhowever, the memory consumtion for queryResultCache is unpredictable.\n\nWith this patch, if the administrator wants to control memory consumtion more strict, he can set queryResultWindowSize with noCacheIfLarger=\"true\".",
