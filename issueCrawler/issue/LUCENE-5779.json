    "description": "GeoPortal's area overlap algorithm didn't consider lines and points; they end up turning the score 0.  I've thought about this for a bit and I've come up with an alternative scoring algorithm.  (already coded and tested and documented):\nNew Javadocs:\n\n/**\n * The algorithm is implemented as envelope on envelope overlays rather than\n * complex polygon on complex polygon overlays.\n * <p/>\n * <p/>\n * Spatial relevance scoring algorithm:\n * <DL>\n *   <DT>queryArea</DT> <DD>the area of the input query envelope</DD>\n *   <DT>targetArea</DT> <DD>the area of the target envelope (per Lucene document)</DD>\n *   <DT>intersectionArea</DT> <DD>the area of the intersection between the query and target envelopes</DD>\n *   <DT>queryTargetProportion</DT> <DD>A 0-1 factor that divides the score proportion between query and target.\n *   0.5 is evenly.</DD>\n *\n *   <DT>queryRatio</DT> <DD>intersectionArea / queryArea; (see note)</DD>\n *   <DT>targetRatio</DT> <DD>intersectionArea / targetArea; (see note)</DD>\n *   <DT>queryFactor</DT> <DD>queryRatio * queryTargetProportion;</DD>\n *   <DT>targetFactor</DT> <DD>targetRatio * (1 - queryTargetProportion);</DD>\n *   <DT>score</DT> <DD>queryFactor + targetFactor;</DD>\n * </DL>\n * Note: The actual computation of queryRatio and targetRatio is more complicated so that it considers\n * points and lines. Lines have the ratio of overlap, and points are either 1.0 or 0.0 depending on wether\n * it intersects or not.\n * <p />\n * Based on Geoportal's\n * <a href=\"http://geoportal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geoportal/Geoportal/trunk/src/com/esri/gpt/catalog/lucene/SpatialRankingValueSource.java\">\n *   SpatialRankingValueSource</a> but modified. GeoPortal's algorithm will yield a score of 0\n * if either a line or point is compared, and it's doesn't output a 0-1 normalized score (it multiplies the factors).\n *\n * @lucene.experimental\n */",
