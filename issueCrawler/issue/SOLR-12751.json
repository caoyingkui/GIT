I am not getting the results related to multi words on the page.\n\nFor example: I am not seeing the results like [Terminals &\u00a0Schedules\u00a0|\u00a0Intermodal\u00a0| Shipping Options ...\u00a0page on starting and getting random results and the\u00a0\u00a0[Terminals &\u00a0Schedules\u00a0|\u00a0Intermodal\u00a0| Shipping Options\u00a0...\u00a0page displaying after the 40 results.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere is the query on browser URL:\n\nhttp://test-servername/content/nscorp/en/search-results.html?start=0&q=Intermodal+Schedule\n\n\u00a0\n\nI am using solr version 7.4",
