    "description": "In the case when \"Set<String> words\" is large, constructing a KeepWordFilter at query time is very costly because of the construction (copy) of the set, e.g.:\n\n    this.words = new CharArraySet(words, ignoreCase);\n\nThis call does an addAll on the set, and is done for each query, and is the same work.\n\nSuggestion: overload the constructor and expose the CharArraySet, e.g.:\n\n  public KeepWordFilter(TokenStream in, CharArraySet words ) \n{\n    super(in);\n    this.words = words;\n    this.termAtt = (TermAttribute)addAttribute(TermAttribute.class);\n  }\n\nThis allows the ability to have CharArraySet to be constructed once staticly for the application instead at query time.",
