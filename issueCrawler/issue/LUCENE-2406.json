    "description": "Currently, the IndexSearcher lets you limit the number of hits that a search returns. Ironically, that option works against you if the limit is set to a very large number. In particular, during the initialization of the search process, the hit queue attempts to allocate as many document scores as the hit limit. Needless to say, this is bound to lead to out of memory issues in the event the hit limit passed by the user is very large.\n\nThis issue can be verified by setting the hit limit to the maximum integer value (please see test case attached herein.) Note that the test fails in the PriorityQueue#initialize method as it tries to increase the hit limit by one (to make room for a sentinel object), which causes an integer overflow (please see the stack trace attached herein.)\n\nThe root cause of this issue lies not in the priority queue, but in the index searcher itself. Ideally, it should ensure that the hit limit does not exceed it's maxDoc count, which typically is the maximum number of documents held in the underlying index reader. A patch that implements the above sanity check has been attached herein.",
