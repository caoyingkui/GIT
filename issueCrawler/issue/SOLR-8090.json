    "description": "The CSS for the admin UI in 5.3.1 has the following definition which affects help text in a variety of places:\n\n#core-selector #has-no-cores span\n{\n  color: #c0c0c0;\n  display: block;\n}\n\nThis is displayed on a white background, making the text with colour #c0c0c0 next to impossible to read. This fails WCAG accessability guidelines and can be checked using this Contract Checker: http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\n\nPlease adjust the CSS for the admin UI to display text in a more highly contrasted colour. Thanks.",

I changed it to #8D8D8D on the logging screen in SOLR-11895, but reviewing that choice in the context of this test, it's only a marginally better choice than what exists today.\n\nUsing #4D4D4D would be dark enough to pass the test but still be lighter than #000 to achieve the original goal of de-emphasizing some text. That said, there are some things that we just shouldn't de-emphasize at all (like the Collection/Core menus in the left drop-down), so I would propose just not trying to do it in those places.\n\nI'll put a patch up for this in a day or so, with some before/after screenshots.

I darkened the Collections menu items (and made the selected text white), and changed the Args list on the Dashboard to highlight the background of the rows instead of lightening the color.\n\nTODO: I realized as I was uploading the patch that there are some places that use #bbb as the color, which is also too light; I'll standardize those with #4D4D4D also as appropriate (the Core menu is one example of this).
