    "description": "on the mailing list, Charles Sanders noted that the [explain] transformer wasn't working in Solr 5(.5.1) - showing a sample query that indicated he was using SolrCloud.\n\nIn 6.0 and on master this works fine, so whatever bug affects 5.x was fixed at some point \u2013 but we don't appear to have any cloud based tests that invoke [explain], so we should add something akin to TestPseudoReturnFields to ensure no regressions in the future.",

            "content": "work in progress patch...\n\nTestPseudoReturnFields has some asserts that claim they \"also check real-time-get from transaction log\" \u2013 but the test setup is going out of it's way to disable the updateLog (blaming schema12.xml for not suppporting _version_)\n\nWhen i tried to fix this to do a true RTG against uncommitted data, I encountered what appears to be a legitimate bug using a psuedo-fields in that situtation \u2013 so as i've been making my way building up a new \"TestCloudPseudoReturnFields\" i've been keeping an eye out for opportunities to add more RTG equivilences of the existing search+asserts as well (in both single node and cloud mode situations) and it looks like there's more then one bug in each situation.\n\n(You can see the problematic assertions in the patch, but the tests due currently pass due to strategically placed  Assume calls to prevent the problematic assertions from running \u2013 that way new failures jump out at me easier as i beef up the test(s)) ",
