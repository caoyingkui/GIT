Seems like an awkward decision.\n\n\nfrom solrconfig.xml\n...\n      For the purposes of the tutorial, JSON responses are written as\n      plain text so that they are easy to read in *any* browser.\n      If you expect a MIME type of \"application/json\" just remove this override.\n...\n\n\n\nresolving issue as \"not a problem\" "
