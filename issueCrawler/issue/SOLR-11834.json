So, did a little digging into the code\nIn case of standalone/single sharded, subquery response would be added as result Context and Response Writer handle writing result context(here, subquery's fl is available)\nIn case of multi-sharded, first pass is similar to standalone/single sharded. In case of a sharded request, all shard responses would be collected then the final response would be formed (as per my understanding, please correct if I'm wrong).\nIn the final response, subquery's response would SolrDocumentList.
