If they only get stored in Zookeeper then how can they be backed up in case of a Zookeeper failure where all the config needs to be reloaded back into Zookeeper? Would I just have to recreate all of the aliases?\n\nAs far as I know, they are indeed only in zookeeper.  You can see them in the Admin UI by clicking the Cloud tab, then Tree, then /aliases.json in the tree view.  You should maintain documentation on how you built your SolrCloud and Zookeeper configs so you can recreate them if you lose them entirely.\n\nA fully redundant zookeeper ensemble with three or more hosts should keep you from encountering a situation where you have to entirely reconstruct the ZK database, but but you do bring up a good point - it is always a good idea to have actual backups in case of severe bugs, human error, or malicious intent.\n\nHere's some information at the zookeeper level on maintenance and data file management:\n\nhttp://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_maintenance\nhttp://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_dataFileManagement\n\nI found these URLs in a Stack Overflow question about backing up zookeeper:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6394140/how-do-you-backup-zookeeper "
