    "description": "1.) The default implementation fo 'ps' in Solaris can't handle \"ps auxww\".\nFortunatly you can call \"/use/ucb/ps auxww\" instead. Maybe one can add something like ...\n> PS=ps\n> if [ \"$THIS_OS\" == \"SunOS\" ]; then\n>   PS=/usr/ucb/ps\n> fi\nand replace all \"ps aux\" with \"$PS aux\" \n\n2.) Some implementations of 'sleep' support integers only. The function 'spinner()' is using 0.5 as parameter. A delay of one second does not look that nice, but would be more portable.",
