(\"oh, ok .. so this type doesn't require a precisionStep which is a thing that isn't explained anywhere else??? .. so then why are you bringing it up???\")\n\nMaybe they should all just have the structure...\n\n\nFoo field (xx-bit signed foo). This class encodes foo values using a \"Dimensional Points\" based data structure that allows for very efficient searches for specific values, or ranges of values. ...\n\n\nWDYT?\n\n(All the of the changes in your commits look reasonable ... i'll try to take a look at the other pages/sections you mentioned soon.  Note that this jira query should identify all known caveats to using point fields \u2013 or at least the ones i know of, unless someone else added new issues since i created that label and didn't tag them) ",
