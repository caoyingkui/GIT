I need purely integers in the column.\n\nShould the timeseries() have output values for all functions even if there are no documents in the bucket?\u00a0Or is there something similar to the select() expression that can take a stream of tuples not originating directly\u00a0from search() and replace values? Or is there perhaps a function that can loop through the column produced by col()\u00a0and replace non-numeric values with 0?",
