Perhaps it should have been removed earlier in LUCENE-7664 which was the removal of GeoPointField which was essentially why the module existed.  Better late than never.",

            "content": "Hi everyone.  I was brought here by YETUS-645.  Since there were questions about what went wrong, I re-triggered the test run to see why it was blowing up since the log files had rolled off.\n\nFirst, the good news: The patch applied fine.   Yetus definitely supports 0-level patches such as generated by IntelliJ; special handling is there to try to determine what the appropriate patch level should be.  If Yetus couldn't apply the patch, it would have reported the fact explicitly. That's clearly not the case here.  \n\nNow, the bad news: As Steve Rowe speculated, Yetus definitely stumbles a bit when modules are moved or deleted in a patch.  It has been a known issue for a while (YETUS-14 !).  I think it's been a low priority to fix since it doesn't happen that often in a lot of code bases.  If you folks need to make sure that works, let me know and I'll try to prioritize fixing it.\n\nBut the badder news:  the patch appears to have introduced 4 new javac warnings in lucene_spatial-extras. Don't let them get lost in that sea of red. \n\n ",
