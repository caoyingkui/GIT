    "description": "Spatial4j 0.6 was released the 26th of February and I want to upgrade to it.  The most impactful change is that the package moves from com.spatial4j.core to org.locationtech.spatial4j.  For that reason, it would be ideal to do this for Lucene 6.0\n\nhttps://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/blob/master/CHANGES.md",

            "content": "Here's the patch.  It passes pre-commit and tests pass.  Of note it includes an updated Spatial4j NOTICE.txt file.  And it also removes the @AwaitsFix annotations added in LUCENE-6867 since it's a non-issue now.\n\nNicholas Knize as this is not a feature and it changes some package statements, I think it should ideally go into the 6.0 release.  Cool? "
