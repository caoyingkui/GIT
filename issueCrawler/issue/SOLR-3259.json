            "content": "+1 to the general idea of lifting the first-time experience of Solr. I like all your proposals except...\n\nI'm not sure if we gain much by moving the example to a \"server\" folder. I think it's a Good Thing\u2122 that we make it clear that what's provided is just an example, not for production. Another name for the example folder could be \"jetty\", because that's what it really is - which many are confused by today, they think that the \"lib\" and \"etc\" folders below \"example\" belong to Solr...\n\nIf anything I'd vote for making the distro closer to what people would want in production. You could then have a pure \"solr/jetty\" folder with ONLY jetty, a \"solr/example-home\" folder which holds todays \"example/solr\" making it more obvious what folder is actually the SOLR_HOME, and finally a start script on top level, start-solr.[cmd|sh], which copies the war from dist to jetty/webapps, sets -Dsolr.solr.home and starts Jetty. By default start-solr.sh would log to stdout, but a param could have it log to file. "

Most people end up using the example as there base anyhow - I doubt it has much benefit in pointing people to trim down their configs. This whole idea of providing a webapp and then an example setup is just old and ugly. We should care about one containter, the one we ship with, and our default shipping configs should be a good enough starting point that we don't have to call the folder \"please_you_must_edit_configs_and_not_start_me_out_of_the_box\"\n\njetty\n\nNot a fan - I think non Java guys should be able to open the package and quickly see the folder they need to move to. jetty is not great here - server is better.

Of course if we moved just the essential parts to \"server\", then \"multicore\", \"example-DIH\" and \"exampledocs\" would all be left behind in \"example\", as they should be.\n\nonce upon a time, i argued heavily that we should renamed \"example\" to \"examples\" and have many more of them (\"minimal\", \"tech-products-from-the-90s\", \"books\", \"kitchen-sink\", \"multicore\", \"dih\", etc...) .. and the only reason i never pushed harder for this was because that kind of directory structure would have made running the \"main\" example (whatever we might have called it) much harder then \"java -jar start.jar\" because it would have required specifying solr.solr.home.\n\nThinking about it some more now that you've brought this issue up, it occurs to me that in that intervening time, multicore solr setups have been come the norm, not the exception ... so i'm now much more on board the idea of having a single example setup \u2013 even calling it \"server\" if people think that's a good idea \u2013 provided we move all of the various examples we have into that example setup as multiple cores.\n\nthey don't have to all be enabled, they don't even have to be commented out in solr.xml, it would just be nice if they lived in the same directory and could easily be added as new cores with a simple CREATE commands a relative paths.\n\nSo by default if you did \"cd server && java -jar start.jar\" you might only get one collection (or maybe two if we also want to show off a \"minimal\" collection) but the docs for features like DIH might say \"to see an example of this, hit the following URL to create a new collection using the DIH configs: http://localhost...CREATE\"\n\nIf anything I'd vote for making the distro closer to what people would want in production.
