An idea to solve that would be something like a symlink (not possible with subversion) or a .htaccess file that rewrites the URL to the one at the autogen-place.\n\nAuto-updating is not a problem, as the ASF guidelines state that the older keys (after a key-change) should still be kept in the Apache LDAP, so if one person have multiple keys (e.g. outdated ones), all of them are kept in the KEYS file.

do echo match_$keys; for id in $(cat *-ids.txt|sort|uniq); do echo \"Looking for id $(cat *-keys.txt |sort|uniq| grep $id)\"; grep -E \"$id|$(echo $id|echo $id|awk -e '{print substr($_,0,4)\" \"substr($_,5,4);}')\" $keys ;

do echo \"Exporting id $id - $(grep $id lucene-solr-keys.txt)\"; gpg --fingerprint $id >> KEYS_NEW; gpg --export -a $id >> KEYS ; done\n\n\n\nAnd then one of the responsibilities of new RMs is to add their key to this one KEYS file.

So in general never ever delete a key from Apache's id.apache.org system, unless you want to re-sign all artifacts you have published.\nIf we can ensure this, I am fine with deleting the per-version files.\n\nMaybe we should do some crosscheck: Collect all key IDs from all files on dist.apache.org and calculate a union of it. After that check that all keys are also present in the global file. If not, ask the committers to re-upload the old/outdated public keys from the old keys file to their id.apache.org accounts.\n\nUwe ",
