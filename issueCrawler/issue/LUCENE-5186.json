    "description": "There are a couple of use cases I can think of where being able to get the underlying filter out of CachingWrapperFilter would be useful:\n1. You might want to introspect the filter to figure out what's in it (the use case we hit.)\n2. You might want to serialise the filter since Lucene no longer supports that itself.\n\nWe currently work around this by subclassing, keeping another copy of the underlying filter reference and implementing a trivial getter, which is an easy workaround, but the trap is that a junior developer could unknowingly create a CachingWrapperFilter without knowing that the BetterCachingWrapperFilter exists, introducing a filter which cannot be introspected.",
