    "description": "In few days ago ours machine (with solr) was crashed.\nWe rebooted machine and solr, The solr looks like validly behavior.\nBut, The solr is not valid because following : \n\n\tExists Solr core.\n\tExists /tmp/solr directory and /tmp/solr/data/solr_core directory.\n\tExists /tmp/solr/solr.xml and exists solr/cores/core tag.\n\tWe can start Solr Server without exception.\n\t\"$ curl http://localhost:8983/solr/solr_core/select?\" returns 404 Not Found.\n\n\n\nAnd I found the file of '/tmp/solr/data/solr_core/index/segments.gen' is empty file.\nSo, I think there is no (or weak) fault tolerance about Solr.\n\nI hope the solr grow up crash-free server.\nFor example, File handling is atomically as much as possible.",
