    "description": "The interactive debug mode for DIH is really useful, in that you can see what's going to happen without immediately committing your changes, but it would be even more useful if it was possible automatically to rollback changes that are queued by debug mode so that one can conduct repeatable experiments. This is especially true when testing the delta import because this writes the import.properties file even if it has only processed 10 rows out of 1000 in debug mode, making further testing impossible without manually rewriting the import.properties file.",
