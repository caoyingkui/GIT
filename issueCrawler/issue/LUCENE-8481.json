            "content": "I looked at it quickly. The code in overview is out of sync with the actual TestDemo and it doesn't seem to be generated (as the note there implies). RAMDirectory is also used in \n\nlucene\\analysis\\common\\src\\java\\org\\apache\\lucene\\collation\\package-info.java\nlucene\\analysis\\icu\\src\\java\\overview.html \n\n\n\nI didn't check Solr's folder at all, but I bet there are refs there as well. I can replace those occurrences with ByteBuffersDirectory, although I think it'd be better to use FSDirectory in those examples in the spirit of what we truly encourage people to use. A terminating IOUtils.rm(indexLocation) would be required to clean up the temporary folder (and I'd use a real call to Files.createTemporaryDirectory or whatever it's called in NIO). ",

I'm a bit more nervous about removing the index location in the end, as I'm afraid of what could happen with copy-pasting. ",

            "content": "I agree we should fix javadocs too, they're stale. As for removal at the end: it's really an arbitrary decision. I though we could introduce a real temp dir (and a local variable) so that the example would work on Windows and other systems; then the IOUtils.rm(indexLocation) would actually refer to the variable (not hardcoded path), so chances of copy-pasting and doing an rm -rf / are slim and you don't leave unused stuff in the temp folder. Having an rm at the end seems cleaner to me and if you really copy-paste so badly as to introduce a wrong path there... then you deserve the consequences? ",

            "content": "I honestly don't know if this patch should be applied at all; it clearly shows that those snippets of code in the documentation go out of sync with the codebase very quickly. Perhaps we should use some kind of snippet injection or linking to keep the code \"real\" and not rely on manual updates.\n\nThat \"TestDemo\" class is not just out of sync with package documentation, it's also odd and uses test randomization infrastructure, which is way beyond the scope of a simple introductory example. There is also the \"demo\" module which contains another \"TestDemo\", which only adds to the confusion. ",
