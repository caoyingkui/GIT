You can find source code in https://github.com/rmescandon/solr-snap.\nIncludes:\n\n\tSolr 6.4.0 release as a daemon\n\tHook creating a core for nextant by default, when installed\n\n\n\nObviously this is an initial idea and can be modified or complete with whatever you consider needed or better.\n\nYou can clone source code and try it:\n\n\tgit clone git@github.com:rmescandon/solr-snap.git\n\tsnapcraft\n\tsnap install <package> --dangerous",

Have we made some kind of mistake in that script that you're trying to correct?\n\nThe config seems to be limiting the download to a single Apache mirror in Madrid.  That's will probably be less than ideal for anyone outside of Europe, and if enough people use it, will result in that mirror server's Internet connection getting overloaded.  Also, the tarball you've referenced is going to disappear from that mirror server as soon as 6.4.1 or 6.5.0 is released. ",

Once built, the .snap can be hosted anywhere, but ideally it would at least be in the Snap Store hosted by Canonical, because that's used by default. New snaps can be built that use 6.4.1 or 6.5.0 once those are released (or even before, and published to the 'edge' and 'beta' release channels in the store) ",

Is that correct, Roberto Mier?\n\nTherefore I'll close this here as Won't do. Please re-open if there is actually a need for some code/config changes in solr core to ease the creation of a Snap package.\n\nI will encourage those who want to help with the snap package development to head over to the GitHub linked in the issue description and join the discussion there.
