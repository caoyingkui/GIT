    "description": "The attached patch is a GWT generic client for solr. It is currently standalone, meaning that once built, one can open the generated HTML file in a browser and communicate with any deployed solr. It is configured with it's own configuration file, where one can configure the solr instance/core to connect to. Since it's currently standalone and completely client side based, it uses JSON with padding (cross-side scripting) to connect to remote solr servers. Some of the supported features:\n\n\n\tSimple query search\n\tSorting - one can dynamically define new sort criterias\n\tSearch results are rendered very much like Google search results are rendered. It is also possible to view all stored field values for every hit.\n\tCustom hit rendering - It is possible to show thumbnails (images) per hit and also customize a view for a hit based on html templates\n\tFaceting - one can dynamically define field and query facets via the UI. it is also possible to pre-configure these facets in the configuration file.\n\tHighlighting - you can dynamically configure highlighting. it can also be pre-configured in the configuration file\n\tSpellchecking - you can dynamically configure spell checking. Can also be done in the configuration file. Supports collation. It is also possible to send \"build\" and \"reload\" commands.\n\tData import handler - if used, it is possible to send a \"full-import\" and \"status\" command (\"delta-import\" is not implemented yet, but it's easy to add)\n\tConsole - For development time, there's a small console which can help to better understand what's going on behind the scenes. One can use it to:\n\t\n\t\tview the client logs\n\t\tbrowse the solr scheme\n\t\tView a break down of the current search context\n\t\tView a break down of the query URL that is sent to solr\n\t\tView the raw JSON response returning from Solr\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nThis client is actually a platform that can be greatly extended for more things. The goal is to have a client where the explorer part is just one view of it. Other future views include: Monitoring, Administration, Query Builder, DataImportHandler configuration, and more...\n\nTo get a better view of what's currently possible. We've set up a public version of this client at: http://search.jteam.nl/explorer. This client is configured with one solr instance where crawled YouTube movies where indexed. You can also check out a screencast for this deployed client: http://search.jteam.nl/help\n\nThe patch created a new folder in the contrib. directory. Since the patch doesn't contain binaries, an additional zip file is provides that needs to be extract to add all the required graphics. This module is maven2 based and is configured in such a way that all GWT related tools/libraries are automatically downloaded when the modules is compiled. One of the artifacts of the build is a war file which can be deployed in any servlet container.\n\nNOTE: this client works best on WebKit based browsers (for performance reason) but also works on firefox and ie 7+. That said, it should be taken into account that it is still under development.",

I know this project, but from my experience some of their widgets don't perform really well. Personally, when it comes to data visualization I think flash is the best technology we have at the moment and it's quite easy to interact with it via Javascript and GWT (that's how Google does for most of their applications/services: analytics, finances, etc..)

            "content": "Hi Kaoul,\n\nThe solr explorer is a maven project. This patch adds a new folder in the contrib director. Once patched, you can go to the contrib/solrexplorer directory and build the maven project (ie. mvn clean package). One of the artifacts of the build is the directory where the application sits in. \n\nIt's a stand-alone application that runs in the browser. As such, to run the application all you need to do is to open the SolrExplorer.html file in your browser. \n\nTo configure the application you can customize the solr-explorer.xml which sits in the same directory. \n\nThe main reason I made this patch is to contribute this whole code base to the Solr project and hopefully make it an integral part of Solr. If you want to use this tool without concerning yourself with the patch, you can also download it from:\n\nhttp://www.jteam.nl/news/solrexplorer\n\nI'm still working on the user documentation there, but it's a working version nonetheless.

            "content": "working on a new improved patch for the explorer. But I'm at a bit of a dilemma here regarding exactly it should integrate with Solr. There are basically 3 options:\n\n1. Tight integration, where the explorer will be bound to each core and there will be a dedicated URL for it (say /corename/explorer). This is nice as the user gets this functionality out of the box, but on the other hand, I'm not sure users want it to be there out of the box (most of the time, if not always, the explorer will not be used as the final UI, but more of a temporary one, just to have something up and running... in production I can imagine users will not need it). This tight integration also means quite a lot of changes to the current configuration, well, first the dispatch filter will need to change a bit, but also a default request handler will need to be defined for all cores.\n\n2. The other option is to keep the explorer as an external tool. The idea is to have it as a separate war file which can be deployed in the same servlet container as solr. I'm working on removing the current xml configuration and make it more dynamic. So when the user enters the application, she can configure a core by following a wizard-like process... this wizard will create a configuration which will be saved on the server for future \"logins\". \n\n3. Well, the third option is just to leave things as they are now. That is, there is on configuration file which defines all the solr cores the explorer can communicate with. This configuration file is loaded when the web page is loaded. Like option 2, this is also a standalone mode.\n\nany comments? "

In the current version there's a 5 seconds timeout on this connection attempt (this will change to be configurable in the upcoming version). Since you're using the example directory and the index is small, assuming you're running on localhost, the only reason I can think of for this timeout is simple bad configuration. The solr-explorer.xml defines the core and the base solr URL to connect to it... make sure this URL is indeed correct. \n\nLogging is current available, but not at connection time. Once you're logged in, solr explorer has a \"firebug-like\" console with a logging tab (which gives you an insight at what's going on).\n\nCheers,\nUri "
