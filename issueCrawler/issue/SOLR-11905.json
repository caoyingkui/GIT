Alternatively it could be a separate checkbox for \"JSON facet\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe text box should be several lines high to facilitate easy copy/paste of JSON.",

It would be sweet to have a whole separate JSON QUERY tab in the left hand menu that allows you to freely express JSON QUERY & FACET in a huge text box, with context-sensitive help and all. Or there could be two tabs in the existing Query tab to switch between legacy and JSON QUERY style input? ",
