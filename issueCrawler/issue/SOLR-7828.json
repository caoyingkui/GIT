    "description": "The facet functions and analytics working great, especially with json API !\n\nAs a developer, I would like a facet function to get a field value from one record from a group, please see this facet query:\n\n{\n    \"schema\": {\n        \"slide_id\": \n{\n            \"type\": \"long\"\n        }\n,\n        \"slide_name\": \n{\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n,\n        \"slide_create_time\": \n{\n            \"type\": \"timestamp\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"facet.query\": {\n        \"slide_viewed\": {\n            \"type\": \"terms\",\n            \"field\": \"slide_id\",\n            \"facet\": {\n                \"avg_viewed_time\": \"avg(slide_viewed_time)\",\n                \"created_time\": \"max(slide_create_time)\",\n                \"slide_name\": \"ANY_FIRST_LAST_OR_FILTER(slide_name)\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"total\": {\n            \"type\": \"query\",\n            \"q\": \":\",\n            \"facet\": \n{\n                \"slide_num\": \"unique(slide_id)\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nwhen grouping by slide_id, I would love to have the a function that can pick a slide name from each group of slides with the same slide_id.\n\nI know I can get the name by using sub facet, but it will be in one level deep, and I can't sort by it, it would be great to be in one flat level, so they can be sorted.\n\nthanks!",
