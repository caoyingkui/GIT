    "description": "The DIH webapp by default has the \"clean\" checkbox enabled.   Clean is very dangerous because you delete all the data first, and then load the data.   \n\nA previous ticket, SOLR-11933 had some suggestions on how best to solve this problem, specifically:\n\nI think the default of the 'clean' checkbox in the UI should change depending on the type of import selected. This is what happens when using the API directly and the clean parameter is not present.\n\nIf full-import is selected, it should be on, if delta-import is selected, it should be off. (with the option for the user to change the setting, of course)\n\nThis patch applies this logic change.",
