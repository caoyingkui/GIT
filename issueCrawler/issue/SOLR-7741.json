If not, happy to open a JIRA and provide the one-line patch.\n\nChristine Poerschke wrote:\n\nFollow-on question, also re: SolrIndexConfig's toMap method. The constructor reads \"/mergedSegmentWarmer\" and \"/infoStream\" and \"/infoStream/@file\" elements but the toMap method does not write them.\n\nWould that be intended or is it maybe an unintended omission? If intended would be great to have a comment in toMap to clarify why/which elements are skipped, so that if/when a new element is added its easier to determine if toMap should write the new element also.",
