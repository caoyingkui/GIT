    "description": "A scenario which could happen at least before the addition of LeaderInitiatedRecoveryThread I think. Also this can happen only if one is using a non cloud aware client ( which might be quite a few users ) given that we have only SolrJ\n\nEvents are in chronological order -\nLeader -> Lost Connection with ZK\nReplica -> Became leader\nLeader -> add document is successful. Forwards it to the replica\nReplica -> add document is unsuccessful as it is the leader and the request says it is coming from a leader\n\nSo as of now the the Replica(new leader) won't have the doc but the leader(old leader) will have the document.",
