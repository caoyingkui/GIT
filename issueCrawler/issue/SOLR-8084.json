    "description": "On the \"Plugins/Stats\" page, there is a \"Refresh Values\" link.\n\nA user on the mailing list was having problems with this link going to the dashboard.\n\nMy testing on Windows 10 with 5.3.0 on the current UI showed Firefox working properly, but Chrome and Microsoft browsers have problems.  Edge and Chrome return to the dashboard as the user noticed.  IE11 throws up an error that says \"404 Not Found get\".  When that popup is dismissed, the right pane of the window is empty except for a constant spinning icon saying \"Loading ...\".\n\nThe Angular UI shows no problems in all four browsers.  I did not test with any others.",
