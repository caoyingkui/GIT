    "description": "FilterIndexReader does not override all of IndexReader methods. We've hit an error in LUCENE-3573 (and fixed it). So I thought to write a simple test which asserts that FIR overrides all methods of IR (and we can filter our methods that we don't think that it should override). The test is very simple (attached), and it currently fails over these methods:\n\ngetRefCount\nincRef\ntryIncRef\ndecRef\nreopen\nreopen\nreopen\nreopen\nclone\nnumDeletedDocs\ndocument\nsetNorm\nsetNorm\ntermPositions\ndeleteDocument\ndeleteDocuments\nundeleteAll\ngetIndexCommit\ngetUniqueTermCount\ngetTermInfosIndexDivisor\n\n\n\nI didn't yet fix anything in FIR \u2013 if you spot a method that you think we should not override and delegate, please comment.",

Because reopen/openIfChanged must return a new instance of the current IndexReader (which extends FilterIndexReader). By simply delegating it would violate this.\n\nJust a comment to your previous mail: If you call super.reopen() you would confuse the backwards layer (using VirtualMethod) for the transition to doOpenIfChanged, so please don't do it. Just leave it unimplemented.\n\nI would extends the test to add the \"wanted\" methods in a HashSet so it will not check them.\n\n\n\treopen(), doOpenIfChanged(), clone(): see above\n\tnumDeletedDocs should be final in IndexReader\n\tdeleteDocument & similar may be delegated (but i am not sure)\n\n ",

So FIR should reflect this behaviour. We already have some FIRs that explicitely do not support reopen (like SlowMultiReaderWrapper).\n\nI agree with making all those methods final you mentioned above. ",
