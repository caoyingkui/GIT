            "content": "What do you think about this alternative approach:\n\n\n\tSegmentReader, MultiSegmentReader and MultiReader all extend IndexReader\n\tIndexReader.open() always returns a MultiSegmentReader instance, even\nif the index has only one segment. We can make some optimizations, so that\ne. g. MultiSegmentReader.termDocs() returns a SegmentTermDocs in case \nthere's only one underlying SegmentReader.\n\tAll write lock and transaction logic goes into MultiSegmentReader, as\nit is the only reader that has to obtain a write lock.\n\n\n\nThe advantage here is that only one class (MultiSegmentReader) is\nresponsible for acquiring the write lock. It would also make \nIndexReader.open() simpler,  because it can then return a \nMultiSegmentReader instance in all cases. The logic of opening the \ndifferent segments could move from IndexReader.open() to the constructor\nof MultiSegmentReader. Also LUCENE-743 (IndexReader.reopen()) would\nbecome simpler.\nThe disadvantage of this approach is apparently that always using\na MultiSegmentReader would add some overhead when reading optimized \nindexes, but actually I don't think that this overhead would really be\nsignificant.\n\nIf we go the DirectoryIndexReader way (where SegmentReader and \nMultiSegmentReader both extend DirectoryIndexReader), then we still need\nan ownDirectory variable that tells SegmentReader if it has to acquire a\nwrite lock or not, depending on whether it is a subreader of \nMultiSegmentReader or not. And of course we add another layer to the\nIndexReader hierachy. \n\nSo I'm not sure which approach is the better one. I'm hoping to get some\nopionions here! Hoss? Others? ",

Subclasses must implement it if they require \na write lock (so does DirectoryIndexReader now).\n\nIndexReader is very abstract now and almost all logic moved into\nthe subclasses. The methods isOptimized(), isCurrent(), and \ngetVersion() all throw an UnsupportedOperationException (UOE). I \nfurther deprecated the IndexReader constructor that takes a\nDirectory as argument. As soon as we remove this ctr the method\nIndexReader.getDirectory() should throw an UOE as well. I added\na TODO comment as a reminder.\n\nAll unit tests pass with this patch. ",
