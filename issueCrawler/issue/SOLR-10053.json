    "description": "The TestSolrCloudWithDelegationTokens tests fail often at Jenkins. I have been so far unable to reproduce them using the failing seeds. However, beasting these tests seem to cause failures (once after about 10-12 runs).\n\nLatest Jenkins failure: https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-NightlyTests-6.4/12/\n\nIt wasn't apparent what caused these failures. To cut down the noise on Jenkins, I propose that we disable the test with @AwaitsFix (or bad apple) annotation and continue to debug and fix this test.\n\nWDYT, Mark Miller?",

Since we are using WARN logging level for hadoop classes, we don't have enough information for troubleshooting. I suggest that we enable debug logging for delegation token auth related classes and keep the test enabled. Once we get relevant logs, I can spend some more time on this. ",
