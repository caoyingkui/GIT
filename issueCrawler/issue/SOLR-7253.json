    "description": "Solr 5.0 added stats to its pivot facet component, so that this query \n\n\nfacet=true&stats=true&stats.field={!tag=t1}income&facet.pivot={!stats=t1}tags&facet.prefix=university\n\n\n\nreturns stats for each facet with a tag that starts with \"university\".  Very fast.\nIt returns these stats:  min,max,count,missing,sum,sumOfSquares,mean,stddev\n\nThe issue is that it returns these stats for ALL facets matching the query criteria.  No ability to limit or sort, e.g. to return the top 20 earning universities.\n\nIf this functionality can be added, then Solr could deliver on a more complete ability for analytics, rivaling more complex SQL aggregate queries.",
