(<checksum> has a \"format\" attribute now, but that wasn't added until ~Dec2006, so I think it requires ant 1.7)\n\nthe way we solved the problem was with the <solr-checksum> macro added to our build.xml in this commit...\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/solr/trunk/build.xml?r1=483882&r2=484780\n\nbackground...\nhttp://www.nabble.com/%22correct%22-format-for-the-md5-files--tf2779495.html#a7754724 ",
