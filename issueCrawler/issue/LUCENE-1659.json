    "description": "Most apps don't need writable IndexReader, and, a readOnly IndexReader\nhas better concurrent performance.\n\nI'd love to simply default readOnly to true, and you'd have to specify\n\"false\" if you want a read/write reader (I think that's the natural\ndefault), but that'd likely break too many back-compat cases.\n\nSo the workaround is to make the parameter explicit, in 2.9.\n\nI think even for IndexSearcher's methods that open an IndexReader\nunder the hood, we should also make the parameter explicit.",
