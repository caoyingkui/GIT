    "description": "I was updating Solr's web site with the 3.4.0 release, but suddenly\ndiscovered that the javadocs for the test-framework and solrj (linked\nunder the Documentation tab on the left) are missing from\napache-solr-3.4.0.tgz.\n\nIe, when I \"tar xzf\" that, then:\n\n\nfind . -name index.html\n./docs/index.html\n./docs/api/index.html\n\n\n\n(3.3.0's tgz does include them)\n\nI think this is just a packaging problem (maybe from the recent\nrenaming?); I see their javadocs under solr/build/solr-solrj/docs/api\nand solr/build/solr-test-framework/docs/api.\n\nI also see seprate javadocs for all solr contribs... are these\nsupposed to be published on the web site?\n\nFor now I've just copied up the solrj and test-framework jdocs, built\nfrom the 3.4 branch, to the site.  But we should fix this for\n3.5.0....",
