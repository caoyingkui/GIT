This then meant\nthat we incRef'd one set of files on opening the reader, but then\ndecRef'd a different set of files when closing it, causing over-decRef\nof the _N.si and _N_upgraded.si files.\n\nIt's \"normally\" safe to not deep-clone the SI because it \"normally\"\ndoesn't change after it's created, but in this one case (upgrading a\n3.x SegmentInfo on commit), it does (we call SI.addFile(..)).\n\nThe fix was to make it an option to also clone the SI instances.\n\nHowever, we can't do this always (whenever SIS.clone is invoked)\nbecause in other places where we SIS.clone we rely on the SI not being\ncloned (I added a separate test case showing this).
