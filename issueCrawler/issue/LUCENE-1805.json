    "description": "CloseableThreadLocal does not allow null Objects in its get() method, but does nothing to prevent them in set(Object). The comment in get() before assert v != null is irrelevant - the application might have passed null.\n\nNull is an important value for Analyzers. Since tokenStreams (a ThreadLocal private member in Analyzer) is not accessible by extending classes, the only way for an Analyzer to reset the tokenStreams is by calling setPreviousTokenStream(null).\n\nI will post a patch w/ a test",

            "content": "Remove assert v != null and added a test case.\n\nFunny, but it's as if CTL itself could cause this bug. If you call ctl.get() w/o setting anything first, it creates a WeakReference and set the initValue(), which is ... null !. The first call to get() will return null, the second would fail. \n\nBTW, TestCloseableThreadLocal is under o.a.l.index. Shouldn't it be under o.a.l.util? Can whoever assigns this to himself move it?

Else it doesn't call set?  (So calling get() twice in a row not having called set shouldn't hit an exception).  I think? ",
