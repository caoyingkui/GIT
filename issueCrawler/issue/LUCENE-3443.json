    "description": "[Spinoff from LUCENE-3390]\n\nI think the approach in 3.x for handling un-valued docs, and making it\npossible to specify how such docs are sorted, is better than the\nsolution we have in trunk.\n\nI like that FC has a dedicated method to get the Bits for docs with field\n\u2013 easy for apps to directly use.  And I like that the\nbits have their own entry in the FC.\n\nOne downside is that it's 2 passes to get values and valid bits, but\nI think we can fix this by passing optional bool to FC.getXXX methods\nindicating you want the bits, and the populate the FC entry for the\nmissing bits as well.  (We can do that for 3.x and trunk). Then it's\nsingle pass.",
