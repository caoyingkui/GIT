    "description": "When you click on a core in the web gui, you get a URL like the following in the browser URL bar:\n\nhttp://server:port/solr/#/corename\n\nThere have been some instances on the mailing list where users try to use this URL in an API like SolrJ.  If the main core page were to display the proper URL, there would be less confusion.  Unless we make it so that accessing the proper base URL gives a helpful message in the browser, it should not be a link.  I'll file another feature request for that helpful message.",
