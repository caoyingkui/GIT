    "description": "This is from LUCENE-1515\n\nI propose that all stemming TokenFilters have an 'exclusion set' that bypasses any stemming for words in this set.\nSome stemming tokenfilters have this, some do not.\n\nThis would be one way for Karl to implement his new swedish stemmer (as a text file of ignore words).\nAdditionally, it would remove duplication between lucene and solr, as they reimplement snowballfilter since it does not have this functionality.\nFinally, I think this is a pretty common use case, where people want to ignore things like proper nouns in the stemming.\n\nAs an alternative design I considered a case where we generalized this to CharArrayMap (and ignoring words would mean mapping them to themselves), which would also provide a mechanism to override the stemming algorithm. But I think this is too expert, could be its own filter, and the only example of this i can find is in the Dutch stemmer.\n\nSo I think we should just provide ignore with CharArraySet, but if you feel otherwise please comment.",

            "content": "So I think we should just provide ignore with CharArraySet, but if you feel otherwise please comment.\nWhile I read your proposal a possibly more flexible design came to my mind. We could introduce a StemAttribute that has a method public boolean stem() used by every stemmer to decide if a token should be stemmed. That way we decouple the decision if a token should be stemmed from the stemming algorithm. This also enables custom filters to set the values based on other reasons aside from a term being in a set. \nThe default value for sure it true but can be set on any condition. inside an analyzer we can add a filter right before the stemmer based on a CharArraySet. Yet if the set is empty or null we simply leave the filter out. \n ",

When I started implementing this attribute I had FlagAttribute in mind but I didn't choose it because users can randomly choose a bit of the word which might lead to unexpected behavior. \n\nAnother solution I had in mind is to introduce another Attribute (or extend FlagAttribute) holding a Lucene private (not the java visibility keyword) Enum that can be extended in the future.

Cloning an Attribute using the following code is much slower than invoking clone() [please note, not because of the reflections, it there to show how it should be implemented):\n\n\nAttributeImpl clone = this.getClass().newInstance();\nthis.copyTo(clone);\nreturn clone;\n\n\n\nMichi Busch and me are currently investigating fast Attribute Proxies (needed for flex MultiEnums) and also fast capturing of states using CGLIB.

So it does not matter if you have a separate attribute or the FlagsAttribute for cloning in this issue. Only in the case that having multiple boolean attributes in the same stream, there is additional cost. But this is really seldom, so type safety is more important and helps preventing bugs.\n\nAnd by the way, you can combine all attributes using a special AttributeFactory into the same AttributeImpl if you need speed (e.g. Token). Then you can have lots of boolean attributes with getters/setters, but all use the same AttributeImpl with the same bitset. If we have more than one boolean attribute in lucene in future, we can extend DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_FACTORY to support this. ",

Token bundles multiple attributes together w/o loss of type safety, right?\n\nWith \"type safety\" I mean, not attributes in general (they are type safe withy any impl). FlagAttribute itsself is not type safe, because everybody can store/update any bit in this integer. If you have two different filters updating the same bit but mean something other with the bit, it gets broken. Maybe other Filters just update the flags using no bit operations (because we have no support for these in the API).\n\nIf we have more than one boolean attribute in lucene in future, we can extend DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_FACTORY to support this.\n\nMy idea is to have a default AttributeImpl for boolean attributes that support things like set/get of a bit (like BitSet). You subclass it e.g. to generate a combined impl for 4 boolean interfaces we may have in futrure in Lucene core. In the ctor you pass the bitmasks and the impl of all boolean get/setters delegate to the generic BitSet-like methods. Clone and copyTo it then simple, as it only copies the word if the target AttributeImpl is the same class (like Token.copyTo). ",
