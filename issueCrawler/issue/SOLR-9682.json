    "description": "Currently, \"filter\" only supports query strings (examples at http://yonik.com/solr-json-request-api/ )\n\nIt would be nice to be able to reference a param that would be parsed as a lucene/solr query.  Multi-valued parameters should be supported.\n\nWe should keep in mind (and leave room for) a future \"JSON Query Syntax\" and chose labels appropriately.",

So think of \"queryParam\" as the type of the query.  The value is retrieved from \"params\" and parsed as a lucene/solr query.  paramToSolrQuery would be more exact/descriptive, but too long and awkward to remember exactly.\n\"deref\" or \"dereference\" ?

I'll probably separate that out to it's own issue. ",

So for maximum consistency, one would then want to change lucene/solr syntax to accept \"$myFilterParam\" as well.\nIf not, one would then need to escape queries differently depending on if they will be used in something like \"fq\" vs \"filter\".
