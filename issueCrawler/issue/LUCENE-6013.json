    "description": "Like LUCENE-6006, here's another pre-cursor for LUCENE-6005\n... because I think it's important to nail down Lucene's low-schema\n(FieldType/FieldInfos) semantics before adding a high-schema.\n\nIndexableFieldType.indexed() is redundant with\nIndexableFieldType.indexOptions() != null, so we should remove it,\ncodecs shouldn't have to write/read it, high-schema should not configure it, etc.\n\nSimilarly, the FieldInfo.indexed bit is redundant, so I removed it, but I\nleft the sugar API (FieldInfo.isIndexed) and implement it as just\nchecking IndexOptions != null.",
