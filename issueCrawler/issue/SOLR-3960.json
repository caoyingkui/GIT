    "description": "When specifying the cloud options (-DzkRun -DnumShards=n) in solr startup parameters, solr search does not consider any PostFilters.\nFor example, I have implemented a PostFilter and wrapped that in my QParserPlugin sub class. Then in the solr query I am using fq to apply post filtering by specifying fq=\n{!pf1}\n where pf1 is the name of my QParserPlugin. This all works well in solr and not in solr cloud. \nI debugged and figured out that org.apache.solr.search.Grouping.execute() method is called by the non cloud instance. This considers pf.PostFilter which is the collection of all PostFilters whereas org.apache.solr.search.grouping.CommandHandler.execute() which is called by the solr cloud instance ignores the pf.PostFilter.",

            "content": "Nathan: just to clarify, you said...\n\nWhen specifying the cloud options (-DzkRun -DnumShards=n) in solr startup parameters, solr search does not consider any PostFilters.\n\nbut then you go on to say...\n\nI debugged and figured out that org.apache.solr.search.Grouping.execute() method is called by the non cloud instance. This considers pf.PostFilter which is the collection of all PostFilters whereas org.apache.solr.search.grouping.CommandHandler.execute() \n\nwhich makes it sound like this problem is specific to using the grouping features combined with distributed search (ie: solr cloud) and not a general problem with all distributed search.\n\ncan you please confirm/clarify that? when you do a regular search, w/o using grouping, then do you see your postfilter used in solrcloud?\n\nIt would also help if you could provide a simple example of the problem you are seeing that didn't require using your custom component QParserPlugin \u2013 so we can rule out that there isn't anything odd in how your custom code.  a JUnit test would be ideal, but even providing an example URL using the example configs that are included with solr showing the problem would be helpful. (eg: the frange qparser can be used as a PostFilter)\n\n\n "

The confusion earlier happened because I had some default grouping enabled for all the queries in the solrconfig select handler.\nUpdated the title accordingly. "
