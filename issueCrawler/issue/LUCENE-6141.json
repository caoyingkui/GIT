    "description": "The current logic checks that the same chunksize and compression algorithm were used, but this is obselete as it no longer iterates chunks.\n\nWe only need to check that the format version is the same.\n\nThis also allows for bulk merging across compression algorithms. A good use case is BEST_SPEED -> BEST_COMPRESSION for archiving.",
