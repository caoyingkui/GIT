I think it should just depend on ant itself for now? this is how the other modules are done.\n\nits also confusing lucene/test-framework doesnt just depend on its own lib/ but instead junit-path + ant-path (which add up to that, but i dont like it). These paths are separately needed for e.g. running tests and other things, but shouldnt be used here. ",
