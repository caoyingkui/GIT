            "content": "I like it, although I'm not sure if IOUtils.close(...) is the right method name. I had to look at it a few times to understand what it does... it's not really \"closing\" anything, it just applies the consumer predicate to all arguments, suppressing any exceptions except the first one... Wouldn't it be better to call it something like \"applyToAll\" (other name suggestions welcome) and provide a better explanation of how exceptions are handled in the javadoc?\n\nNot a blocker at all, but I think it'd make it easier to understand (since IOConsumer is not even closeable).
