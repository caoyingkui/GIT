    "description": "Lucene classification module's flexibility and capabilities may be improved with the following:\n\n\tmake it possible to use them \"online\" (or provide an online version of them) so that if the underlying index(reader) is updated the classifier doesn't need to be trained again to take into account newly added docs\n\teventually pass a different Analyzer together with the text to be classified (or directly a TokenStream) to specify custom tokenization/filtering.\n\tnormalize score calculations of existing classifiers\n\tprovide publicly available dataset based accuracy and speed tests\n\tmore Lucene based classification algorithms\n\n\n\nSpecific subtasks for each of the above topics should be created to discuss each of them in depth.",
