And we want to do this for 2.9, since local lucene is not yet released and we have the freedom to make such an otherwise drastic change to the index format.\n\nI'll update this issue to reflect it's new goal.

I wonder if it would make sense to do some cleanup in the code (final vars and args etc.) and if we should remove this logging code. It makes sense to use logging but afaik there is no ultimate logging api in lucene so i would rather go for removing the logging code before we release. Is that worth a new issue?!\n\nsimon ",

The best is, that you can now use the double FieldCache which should speed up the LocalLucene queries and needs less memory.\n\nBy the way: I was also tending to add these convenience methods to NumericUtils  For completeness, shoudl we also add them for the ones with the shift value at the end? an char[]? I was reluctant to do this.\n\nI think the easy conversion methods to/from String withou shift would be enough. ",
