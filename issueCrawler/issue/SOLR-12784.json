We moved everything to Git a couple years ago and this link never got fixed apparently. The correct link today is https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucene-solr.git;a=blob;f=solr/core/src/test-files/solr/collection1/conf/stemdict.txt.\n\nInstead of pointing to the file like we do today, I'll see if I can do something better like dynamically pull it from the repo into the page itself when we build the page.

But if we need one, it will be included. \n\nIt will be fixed in 7.6, however (or 8.0, whichever comes first). ",
