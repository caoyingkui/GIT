    "description": "I'm seeing NPE's in DebugComponent with debugQuery=true when just ID & score are requested, which enables the single-pass distributed search optimization from SOLR-1880.\n\nThe NPE originates on this line in DebugComponent.finishStage():\n\n\nint idx = sdoc.positionInResponse;\n\n\n\nindicating an ID that is in the explain but missing in the resultIds.\n\nI'm afraid I haven't been able to reproduce this in DistributedQueryComponentOptimizationTest, but wanted to open this ticket in any case.",
