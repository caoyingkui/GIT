    "description": "Something to look into....\n\ntests that use JettySolrRunner frequently fail with stack traces like this...\n\njava.net.BindException: Address already in use\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketBind(Native Method)\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.bind(PlainSocketImpl.java:359)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.bind(ServerSocket.java:319)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.<init>(ServerSocket.java:185)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.<init>(ServerSocket.java:141)\n\tat org.mortbay.jetty.bio.SocketConnector.newServerSocket(SocketConnector.java:78)\n\tat org.mortbay.jetty.bio.SocketConnector.open(SocketConnector.java:72)\n\tat org.mortbay.jetty.AbstractConnector.doStart(AbstractConnector.java:252)\n\tat org.mortbay.jetty.bio.SocketConnector.doStart(SocketConnector.java:145)\n\tat org.mortbay.component.AbstractLifeCycle.start(AbstractLifeCycle.java:40)\n\tat org.mortbay.jetty.Server.doStart(Server.java:221)\n\tat org.mortbay.component.AbstractLifeCycle.start(AbstractLifeCycle.java:40)\n\tat org.apache.solr.client.solrj.embedded.JettySolrRunner.start(JettySolrRunner.java:89)\n\n\n\n...because they have a hardcoded port number in them.  it occurred to me tonight that java.net.ServerSocket will pick a port for you automaticly if you specify a port of \"0\", the real port can then be accessed by getLocalPort().\n\nwe should see if passing 0 to Jetty's \"Server\" class works, and if in doing so we can then add a method to JettySolrRunner to introspect the actual port after starting the server (from the Jetty javadocs this seems possible by calling jettyServer.getConnectors()[0].getLocalPort() ... with some error checking of course).\n\nthen we could change all the relevant tests so that instead of a hardcoded port number, setUp assigns a value to port after the Jetty Server is started.",
