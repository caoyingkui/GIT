    "description": "Expose Lucene's SpanFirst capability in Solr's extended Dismax query parser. This issue adds the SF-parameter (SpanFirst) and takes a FIELD~DISTANCE^BOOST formatted value.\n\nFor example, sf=title~5^2 will give a boost of 2 if one of the normal clauses, originally generated for automatic phrase queries, is located within five positions from the field's start.\n\nUnit test is included and all tests pass.",

Is there another way to do boost by position?\n\n\n "

I haven't yet uploaded the patch that doesn't throw an error if it is not configured and haven't come to passing it through the analyzer yet or ignoring special characters. I'm not yet sure if we want to strip parens, i think it's the job of the analyzer.\n\nIt is not included in a nightly build because it is not committed, for good reasons  "
