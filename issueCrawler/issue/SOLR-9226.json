It should be moved to overseer to ensure that we don't run multiple such commands in parallel.\n\tThe command should make the best effort to identify a leader and should assign a leader if at least one node is live in the shard\n\tWhen a shard has lost the leader, it is very likely that thousands of such requests will be fired and they would clog the work queue. This command should ensure that duplicate requests for FORCELEADER are consumed up from the work-queue",
