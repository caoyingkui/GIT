    "description": "When using a standalone (non-clustered, non-ZK'd) Solr instance, enabling TLS was a chore for a few reasons. One of them was that `bin/post` doesn't provide a way to specify the client's trust store.\n\nThis is easy to remedy: add a parameter to the `java` invocation in the script to include options set in the shell.",
