    "description": "Hi Solr Team,\n\nAs part of Solr project the installation setup and instances(including clustered solr, zk services and indexing jobs schedulers) is available in Windows 'E:\\ ' drive in production environment. As business needs to remove the E:\\ drive, going forward D:\\  drive will be used and operational.\n\nIs there any possible solution/steps for the moving existing solr installation setup from 'E' drive to 'D' Drive(New Drive) without any impact to the existing application(it should not create re indexing again)\n\nPlease let us know your suggestions/solutions.\n\nYour earliest help will be appreciated!!\n\nThanks,\nSrinivas",
