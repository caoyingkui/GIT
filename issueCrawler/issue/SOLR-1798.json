Following line of code from FastLRUCache.init looks incorrect.\n\n\n    cache.setAlive(false);\n\n\n\nBecause of the above line, all the cache instances created from FastLRUCache are not maintaining any Stats info.\nIf this is correct, I dont understand why are we maintaining a list of stats containing zero values.\n\nOr did I miss something important here?
