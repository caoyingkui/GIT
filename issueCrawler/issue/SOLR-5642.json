    "description": "Solr depends on a lot of parameters to perform queries. These parameters have one- or two-character names like \"q\" and \"fq\" and \"fl\" and \"df\". It would be extremely easy and extremely helpful to users to use tooltips in the web UI that could explain what these parameters actually mean, and it would be further helpful to link directly to the documentation for each. Right now I have no idea what they mean and since there's several versions of the documentation I'm not even sure how to find the best place to look.\n\nAlso, the word \"Dataimport\" on the left should be two words: \"Data Import\" both because \"dataimport\" is not a word in any language and because the \"Schema Browser\" appears as two proper words.",

            "content": "The existing labels are a bit cryptic, but the admin ui is not really meant for non developers either. It seems to me that the labels could be more helpful for new developers however, and having labels like Query (&q=) would have a somewhat tutorial effect. Mouse over's are not helpful until people know they are there, and even then they are painfully slow UI (imho).\u00a0 a \u00a0symbol that links to docs would also be good, but gets slightly complicated since, as the OP notes there are lots of versions, and several locations, and infrastructure gets reorganized from time to time potentially breaking such links. I think to make it sane, the html docs would need to be packaged and installed locally, and served by our jetty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 "
