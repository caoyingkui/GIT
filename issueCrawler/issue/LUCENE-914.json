The bug at LUCENE-413 was probably fixed\nby the changes to SpanScorer then.\n\nDropping these lines also makes DisjunctionSumScorer advance (effectively use next())\nwhen skipTo(target) is called, even when target <= doc().\n\nAlso, I'm changing my opinion on what to do when target <= doc(). I think a DocIdSetIterator\n(and any Scorer) should always advance in that case, just like the javadocs of TermDocs.\n\nWhen Scorers/DocIdSetIterators are combined, for example in disjunctions or conjunctions\nor in the more complex cases of BooleanScorer2, the test for target <= doc() can simply\nbe done before calling skipTo() on any of the combined Scorers/DocIdSetIterators.\n\nNow, if such a change surfaces some bugs like LUCENE-413, so be it. It's better to have\nclearly defined semantics than to have lingering bugs due to explicitly undefined semantics\nin the case of target <= doc().\n\nBtw. there is a small bug in SpanScorer, the (freq != 0) test there should\nbe replaced by a boolean check for actual matches. See SpanScorer.setFreqCurrentDoc().\nThe bug would only surface when the Similarity used in SpanScorer returns 0 for sloppyFreq(). ",
