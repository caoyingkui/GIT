    "description": "Solr uses ZkCredentialsProvider / ZkCredentialProvider in inconsistent ways.\n\nFor example, in the configs it's referred to as zkCredentialProvider\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/6dd0103c8130e6207151fa5c2f9ccfcfe9500c59/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/core/ConfigSolrXml.java#L168\n\nbut the cloud scripts show it as zkCredentialsProvider (wrong):\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/6dd0103c8130e6207151fa5c2f9ccfcfe9500c59/solr/cloud-dev/solrcloud-start.sh#L7\n\nThe implementations refer to ZkCredentialsProvider, i.e.:\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/6dd0103c8130e6207151fa5c2f9ccfcfe9500c59/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/cloud/ZkCredentialsProvider.java\n\nit would be good to be consistent here.  I don't have a preference for which name to use.  Unless we want to put in some code to handle old versions, it seems like we need to break compatibility (i.e. either rename the config names or the names of the implementing classes).",

I really should have marked the API's as experimental for a release or two, but we are generally fairly lenient on java API backcompat currently anyway. As long as we have a good fail message, I think it's fine. ",
