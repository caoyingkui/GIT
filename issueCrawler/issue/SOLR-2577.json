    "description": "Currently, if using \"spellcheck.collateExtendedResults\" in conjunction with \"group=true\", the spelling collation report always gives # of hits as # of documents.  It would be useful to give users the option to get # of groups back instead (or possibly in addition).  This cannot happen, however, until Solr's group function can return the total # of groups.  This functionality is indicated in SOLR-2564.",
