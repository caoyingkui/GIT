            "content": "An open question: we can create solr.jvm metrics for each accessible FileStore, but that may be a lot of metrics, and some of them are of very limited value (eg. procfs, tmpfs, devpts and similar), so it looks like we should at least leave out some common less-than-useful filesystem types.\n\nExample result of FileSystems.getDefault().getFileStores():\n\n/ (/dev/root)\n/dev (devtmpfs)\n/sys (sysfs)\n/proc (proc)\n/dev/shm (tmpfs)\n/dev/pts (devpts)\n/run (tmpfs)\n/run/lock (tmpfs)\n/sys/fs/cgroup (tmpfs)\n/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd (cgroup)\n/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct (cgroup)\n/sys/fs/cgroup/blkio (cgroup)\n/sys/fs/cgroup/memory (cgroup)\n/sys/fs/cgroup/devices (cgroup)\n/sys/fs/cgroup/freezer (cgroup)\n/sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls (cgroup)\n/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc (systemd-1)\n/dev/mqueue (mqueue)\n/sys/kernel/debug (debugfs)\n/sys/kernel/config (configfs)\n/sys/fs/fuse/connections (fusectl)\n/boot (/dev/mmcblk0p6)\n/run/user/1000 (tmpfs)\n/run/user/1000/gvfs (gvfsd-fuse)\n\n\n\nAnother option is to report just the filesystem where dataDir is located, for each SolrCore.
