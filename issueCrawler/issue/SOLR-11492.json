    "description": "Most of the scripts in solr/cloud-dev do things like start using java -jar and other similarly ancient techniques. I recently decided I really didn't like that it was a pain to setup a cloud to test a patch/feature and that often one winds up needing to blow away existing testing so working on more than one thing at a time is irritating... so here's a script I wrote, if folks like it I'd be happy for it to be included in solr/cloud-dev",

When I tried to move to a new repo for commit work I realized I had been relying on a bunch of commands before and after this script on the bash history line, and those lines tended to have directory names baked in that made it hard to easily do things like have a cluster for just testing one issue.\n\nIf others think they would use the new version,\u00a0 I'll be happy to check it into either of /solr/cloud-dev or /dev-tools/scripts ",
