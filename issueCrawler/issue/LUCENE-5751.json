    "description": "This one has fallen behind...\nIt picks TABLE/GCD even when it won't actually save space or help, writes with BlockpackedWriter even when it won't save space, etc.\n\nInstead of comparing PackedInts.bitsRequired, factor in acceptableOverheadRatio too to determine \"will save space\". Check if blocking will save space along the same lines (otherwise use regular packed ints).\n\nFix a similar bug in Lucene49 codec along these same lines (comparing PackedInts.bitsRequired instead of what would actually be written)",
