They are supplied as a strings expression, which is handled by ValueSourceParser or so.\nProblem\u00a0\n\nPassing complex expression as a comma separated list of arguments are problematic, it leads to the verbose naming scheme or puzzling name overload convention with optional arguments. see\u00a0SOLR-12711,\u00a0SOLR-12325. For example, StreamingExpressions\u00a0use name value syntax that's more powerful.\u00a0\nSuggesition\n\nEither introduce JSON syntax for subfacet aggregations, or if nested facets are able to aggregate enclosing buckets, introduce a expandable parsers (plugin point) for JSON.Facet.",
