            "content": "This patch includes support for specifying what term vector information we want to retrieve (tf, df, tf_idf, positions, offsets, all) and specifying term vector fields. A new class called TermVectorInfo is added, containing the returned TermVector information (returned in QueryResponse).  (Not really sure if this is a good name, so feel free to change or give feedback.) The patch also includes a test in SolrQuery for setting/getting parameters, and a test in SolrExampleTests for testing the SolrResponse. One note: I intended to use TermVectorComponent.COMPONENT_NAME in SolrQuery, but ant would not compile because it complained about not being able to find the package:\n package org.apache.solr.handler.component does not exist\nSo temporarily until i figure out why this happens i use \"tv\" for now.. Sorry about that.\nI hope my code makes sense and that it might be useful for others. "

The package you wanted to use is not in solrj's compile classpath. "
