This method does not acquire a write lock in each input Directory, so it is up to the caller to enforce this. \n\nThis method should be acquiring locks: its copying RAW FILES. Otherwise we should remove it. If someone doesnt like that, or is mad because its 10ns slower, they can use NoLockFactory.",

            "content": "The problem is with Directories that don't support locking, e.g. on HDFS. But I guess NoLockFactory is a reasonable solution for them. I don't think there's any performance concern here because addIndexes(Directory...) is doing so much work (depending on the index size of course), that acquiring a lock on each Directory seems negligible.\n\nLet's do that? And also change the jdoc so explicitly state that and the NoLockFactory solution for Directories that cannot support locking? ",
