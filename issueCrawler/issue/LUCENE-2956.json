            "content": "An idea from Mike how to fix this problem:\n\n\nTo avoid the full-stop, I think during the flush we can have two global delete pools. We carefully sweep all DWPTs and flush each, in succession. Any DWPT not yet flushed is free to continue indexing as normal, putting deletes into the first global pool, flushing as normal. But, a DWPT that has been flushed by the \"sweeper\" must instead put deletes for an updateDocument carefully into the 2nd pool, and not buffer the delete into DWPTs not yet flushed. ",

This patch uses a entirely non-blocking approach to deletes based on a specialized linked list that only uses CAS operations.\n\nSince this issue is quiet complex I tried to add as many useful comments as possible inline in the patch to make reviewing easier. So for details check out the patch.\n\nAll test on realtime branch pass with this patch. (once in a while I have a failure in the healthiness test but the assumptions in that test seem to be too strict and I need to fix that separately)\n\nReviews are very very much appreciated!\n ",

            "content": "I think I have an idea, however can you explain the ticketQueue?\n\nSure, since with DWPT the flush process is concurrent and several DWPT could flush at the same time we must maintain the order of the flushes before we can apply the flushed segment and the frozen global\ndeletes it is buffering. The reason for this is that the global deletes mark a certain point in time where we took a DWPT out of rotation and freeze the global deletes.\n\nExample: A DWPT 'A' starts flushing and freezes the global deletes, then DWPT 'B' starts flushing and freezes all deletes occurred since 'A' has started. if 'B' finishes before 'A' we need to wait until 'A' is done otherwise the deletes frozen by 'B' are not applied to 'A' and we might miss to deletes documents in 'A'.\n\nThe Ticket queue simply ensures that we push the frozen deletes and the new created segment in the same order as the corresponding DWPT have started flushing. If a DWPT finishes flushing we update its Ticket and then check the head of the queue if we can remove / publish the ticket. if so we continue publishing until the head of the queue can not be published yet or the queue is empty.

Its been very complex making all the tests pass and figuring out all the little nifty cornercases here. A different, somewhat simpler approach would be great. Eventually for Searchable Ram Buffers we might need to switch to seq. ids anyway but I think for landing DWPT on trunk we can go with the current approach. \nI will update the latest patch and commit it to the branch and merge with trunk again. Once that is done I will setup a hudson build for RT so we give it a little exercise while we prepare moving to trunk.\n\n ",

I remember now that our main concern was the memory usage of using a short[] (for the seq ids) if the total number of documents is numerous (eg, 10s of millions).  Also at some point we'd have double the memory usage when we roll over to the next set, until the previous readers are closed.\n\nI think we should freeze the branch now and only allow merging, bug fixes, tests and documentation fixes until we land on trunk\n\nMaybe once LUCENE-2312 sequence ids work for deletes, we can look at creating a separate branch that implements seq id deletes for all segments, and compare with the BV approach.
