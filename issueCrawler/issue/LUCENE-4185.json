    "description": "Debugging one of my test cases, I found that a TokenStream from an Analyzer constructed by Solr contains the configured chain of CharFilters twice.\n\nWhile I may be mistaken, the fix for LUCENE-4142 appears to make the fix for LUCENE-3721 unnecessary, and the combination of the fixes results in the repeated application of the CharFilters.\n\nI came across this with a test case involving an HTMLStripCharFilter, where the input string contains \"&lt;h1>\". After passing through one HTMLStripCharFilter, it becomes \"<h1>\", and then the HTML is removed by the second filter.",
