I see a couple of other issues that talk about using a regular IndexWriter with a MemoryCodec.\n\nI myself am also looking for a way to do Prospective Search \u2014 I'd like to push documents into both Apache Solr (general search) and something like MemoryIndex (for alerting a large number of users instantly.) I've implemented it to the point where I have a Solr IndexSchema to provide me with the same Analyzers as the ones the Apache Solr instance has, but now I'm running into the issue that MemoryIndex does not support multiple fields and only supports String-valued elements (less of an issue than the lack of multiple-field support) .. Should I make an effort to try and add multiple-field support to MemoryIndex or should I look towards another way of achieving the same?  ",
