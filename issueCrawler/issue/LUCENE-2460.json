    "description": "This package makes it possible to filter results returned from a query based on the results of a bitwise operation on an integer field in the documents returned from the pre-constructed query.\n\nYou can perform three basic types of operations on these integer fields\n\n\n\tBitwiseOperation.BITWISE_AND (bitwise AND)\n\tBitwiseOperation.BITWISE_OR (bitwise inclusive OR)\n\tBitwiseOperation.BITWISE_XOR (bitwise exclusive OR)\n\n\n\nYou can also negate the results of these operations.\n\nFor example, imagine there is an integer field in the index named \"flags\" with the a value 8 (1000 in binary). The following results will be expected :\n\n   1. A source value of 8 will match during a BitwiseOperation.BITWISE_AND operation, with negate set to false.\n   2. A source value of 4 will match during a BitwiseOperation.BITWISE_AND operation, with negate set to true.\n\nThe BitwiseFilter constructor accepts the following values\n\n\n\tThe name of the integer field (A string)\n\tThe BitwiseOperation object. Example BitwiseOperation.BITWISE_XOR\n\tThe source value (an integer)\n\tA boolean value indicating whether or not to negate the results of the operation\n\tA pre-constructed org.apache.lucene.search.Query",
