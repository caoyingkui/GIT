    "description": "I am looking into collectDelta method in DocBuilder.java and I noticed that\nto determine the deltaRemoveSet it currently loops through the whole\ndeltaSet for each deleted row.\n\nDoes anyone else agree with the fact that this is quite inefficient?\n\nFor delta-imports with a large deltaSet and deletedSet I found a\nconsiderable improvement in speed if we just save all deleted keys in a set.\nThen we just have to loop through the deltaSet once to determine which rows\nshould be removed by checking if the deleted key set contains the delta row\nkey.",
