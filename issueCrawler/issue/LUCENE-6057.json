So I thought sorting algorithm lucene use, is not stable (like heap sort, selection sort etc.).  But it looks like thats not the case? When default sort is used (sort by score/relevancy) internal lucene ids are used to break tie. And those ids cange during segment merge etc. Is it wrong to say that lucene uses a non-stable sort? "

I haven't noticed that unstable behaviour because I only needed custom sorting in extremely complicated cases yet and I have always sorted outside of Lucene because of some awkward constraints of legacy sorting code.\n\nMichael McCandless: Maybe that info should be added to the SortField Documentation as well (or at least a hint), because that's the main entry point for users that provide their own sorting.
