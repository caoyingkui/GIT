    "description": "The new code submitted yesterday was lacking a fail safe to close any opened \nindex in the event the tag exited abnormally. Also updated the tag descriptor \nto make the criteria attribute required. I had change the tld during testing \nand not change it back before I submitted the changes. NOTE: the CollectionTag \nis not a player in the current taglib but if anyone wants to figure out a way \nto get the information from that tag into the runtime of the SearchTag either \nduring doInitBody or doAfterBody methods, I am open to suggestion.",
