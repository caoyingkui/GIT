    "description": "Let's say today if the leader sends a message to the replica and it takes more than 10s ( the default TTL timeout ) then PKIAuthenticationPlugin will not pass the principal and RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin will notice this and throw a 401\n\nPKIAuthenticationPlugin.java\n    if ((receivedTime - decipher.timestamp) > MAX_VALIDITY) {\n        log.error(\"Invalid key request timestamp: {} , received timestamp: {} , TTL: {}\", decipher.timestamp, receivedTime, MAX_VALIDITY);\n        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n\n\nRuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin.java\nif (principal == null) {\n        log.info(\"request has come without principal. failed permission {} \",permission);\n        //this resource needs a principal but the request has come without\n        //any credential.\n        return MatchStatus.USER_REQUIRED;\n      }\n\n\n\nI was trying to verify this with PKIAuthenticationIntegrationTest but I noticed that since this test uses MockAuthorizationPlugin where no principal is treated as a 200 the test won't fail.\n\nSo we should enhance MockAuthorizationPlugin to treat no principal as a 401 and add a test in PKIAuthenticationIntegrationTest to verify the behaviour",
