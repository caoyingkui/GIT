    "description": "This query today uses an approximation+confirm approach, but it all happens when you call scorer(), in a termsEnum loop.\n\nThis causes several problems (even after https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-7018) because it can do too much work, if queries have multiple values since the doc can be \"confirmed\" more than once.\n\nI think it would be better to delay this confirmation as much as possible, so that other parts of the query (e.g. other filters, conjunctions, etc) can eliminate checks as well.",

            "content": "Here's an initial patch, the tests seem happy.\n\nIn order to keep the optimization where we only verify edges, we have to use an additional SparseBitSet.\n\nI didn't do any benchmarking yet: i expect that if you benchmark the query in isolation, it can only be very slightly slower (since it needs to set another bit for those edge terms). But I think it should be much better if e.g. AND'd with a termquery or similar. "

            "content": "updated patch that eliminates more checks for e.g. multi-valued cases (by inverting the logic to \"preapproved\" docs).\n\nsince here we talk about docs not terms, there is no reason to assume edge cases are \"abnormal\", so it basically just flips the logic.\n\nalso rather than hardcoding sparse bitset, i added a crude heuristic to use a sparse impl only when the field is sparse, to try to reduce the overhead of this change.
