    "description": "On the admin page for replication, on a slave host, there used to be 3 lines of information about the master:\nLIne 1: master url, i.e. http://foo.bar:8983/solr/core0/replication\nLine 2: Information about the master, i.e. \"Latest Index Version 123456, Generation: 16\nLine 3: More master inro, i.e. \"Replicatable Index Version 123456, Generation: 16\n\nBut now only Line 1 is displaying. There is a block of code in ...replication/index.jsp where this is displayed that never seems to drop into:\n\n<%\n    if (nl != null) {         \n      nl = (NamedList) nl.get(\"master\");\n      if(nl != null){      \n  %>\n<tr>  \n  <td>\n  </td>\n  <td>Latest Index Version:<%=nl.get(\"indexVersion\")%>, Generation: <%=nl.get(\"generation\")%>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td></td>\n  <td>Replicatable Index Version:<%=nl.get(\"replicatableIndexVersion\")%>, Generation: <%=nl.get(\"replicatableGeneration\")%>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<%\n}\n}%>\n\nThose bits of information were quite useful when comparing the slave versions to the master.",
