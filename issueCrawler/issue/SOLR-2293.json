Common partitioning strategies include has-based, date-based and \"custom\".\n\nSolr should have the capability of accepting a document update on any of the nodes in a cluster, and perform partitioning and distribution of updates to correct shard, based on current ZK config. The ShardDistributionPolicy should be pluggable, with the most common provided out of the box.",
