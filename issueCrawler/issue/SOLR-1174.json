If I submit the form using multicore, it goes to /solr/admin/logging (not the right path).\n\nI'm guessing this is because of the path trickery in SolrDispathFilter but I can't follow what the best procedure is to fix it.\n\nThe simplest thing to do is to not use request.getRequestURI() because a form with no action submits to itself.",
