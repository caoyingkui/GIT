It should throw a CloneNotSupportedException if that's the case.\n\n\n\n\n\tPart of the code reads:\n\n\n\n    TermVectorsReader clone = null;\n    try \n{\n      clone = (TermVectorsReader) super.clone();\n    }\n catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {}\n\n    clone.tvx = (IndexInput) tvx.clone();\n\nIf a CloneNotSupportedException is caught then \"clone\" will be null and the assignment to clone.tvx will fail with a null pointer exception.",
