    "description": "the new analysis view is missing the highlighting for matches. screenshots appended to show the difference.\n\nthis was reported by user mloeb on #solr yesterday. initially he asked about highlighting in general - questioning a few things has gotten us to the analysis view for debugging purposes. not seeing any highlights given the index/query data - i've asked him to try the very same in the old admin ui where it worked.\n\ni haven't dived in the code yet, probably Upayavira can give a hint where / at what to look?",

            "content": "You'd probably have to check the code, but here's how I understand this feature:\n\nI believe it's done completely in the admin UI client code.  Every term from the final step of the query analysis is gathered, and at each step of the index analysis, if any of the terms match something in the gathered list, they get highlighted.\n\nAs far as I know, the page doesn't try to verify that the term and the relative position match, which would be a very useful addition.  There are two ways that I can see that working out (probably need a new issue):\n\n\n\tHave a checkbox option to only highlight when both term and relative position match.\n\tHighlight with one color when just the term matches, and another color when both match.  It would probably be a good idea to check to make sure the two colors can be distinguished by people with various forms of color blindness.  I like this option better.\n\n ",
