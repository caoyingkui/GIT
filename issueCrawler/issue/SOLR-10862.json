Since SOLR-9450 removed the javadocs from the Solr package, there is only 1 file in the docs/ directory, effectively breaking that example.\n\nThere are a couple options:\n\n\n\trework the example. Perhaps use the basic crawling capability of bin/post instead? Is that too advanced for new users at this early stage?\n\tremove or replace the example. The later querying examples assume the javadocs are in the index, so those would also need to be reworked.",
