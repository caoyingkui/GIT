    "description": "If things go wrong based on merges with concurrentmergescheduler in tests, its always more difficult to reproduce.\n\nBut we make it worse, CMS can base its behavior on:\n\n\tnumber of cpus.\n\twhether drives are SSDs.\n\n\n\nWe should just allow a (undocumented, for testing) sysprop backdoor to override both of these. This way, it can be set to values completely based on the random seed in LuceneTestCase init, and its not a reproducibility trap.\n\nIts true we try to set explicit values for LuceneTestCase.newIndexWriterConfig() and so forth. But not all tests use randomized IW configs.",
