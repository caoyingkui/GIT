    "description": "In SOLR-350, we added support for multiple cores.  To access each core, you send a request to:\nhttp://host:port/context/@core0/handlerpath - uses core0\nhttp://host:port/context/@core1/handlerpath - uses core1\n\nThis is fine unless a hander is registered to the a name that starts with '@'\n\nI think we should make a rule that the 1st character has to be a letter or digit.  This will give us room to treat other leading punctuation as a key token.  \n\nPerhaps it is not fair to add this restriction after 1.2, but it is (hopefully) a rare case so not a big deal.  I guess we could add a configurable flag to not check this condition...",

This way a client can point to the same location and an admin can change the content with:\n ?action=SETASDEFAULT&core=core1\n ?action=SETASDEFAULT&core=core2\n\n> \n> the only restriction in this case being that core names can't contain \"/\" ... but request handler names can be anything you want (like they are today).\n> \n>   * doesn't impact existing (single core) users\n\nFor backwards compatibility, this could check that MultCore is enabled before squawking over /@ or /\n{not letter or digit}\n \n\n>   * simpler urls for multicore users\n\nhow?  you are just saying that the core name should be required?
