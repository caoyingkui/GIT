    "description": "Some improvements to the Changes.html generated by the changes2html.pl script via the 'changes-to-html' ant task:\n\n\n\tSimplified the Simple stylesheet (removed monospace font specification) and made it the default.  The Fancy stylesheet is really hard for me to look at (yellow text on light blue background may provide high contrast with low eye strain, but IMHO it's ugly).\n\tMoved the monospace style from the Simple stylesheet to a new stylesheet named \"Fixed Width\"\n\tFixed syntax errors in the Fancy stylesheet, so that it displays as intended.\n\tAdded <span style=\"attrib\">  to change attributions.\n\tIn the Fancy and Simple stylesheets, change attributions are colored dark green.\n\tNow properly handling change attributions in CHANGES.txt that have trailing periods.\n\tClicking on an anchor to expand its children now changes the document location to show the children.\n\tHovering over anchors now causes a tooltip to be displayed - either \"Click to expand\" or \"Click to collapse\" - the tooltip changes appropriately after a collapse or expansion.",

For example, the following text:\n\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions (patch #9110); \n\nbecomes:\n\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions (patch #9110 [LUCENE-35]);  ",

This version of the patch renumbers this item to #4, like all previous versions, but it no longer includes a '1' at the beginning of the item's text, as all previous versions did.\n\nShould hierarchical change item formatting be supported?  AFAICT, the above-described item #3.1 is the only occurrence of this phenomenon currently in CHANGES.txt. ",

Attaching a new patch that contains a couple of small changes from your version:\n\n\n\tI found a way to fix the bad IE6 behavior with the dynamic Expand All/Collapse All buttons, so I removed your static <input> tags and put the button creation back in the <head><SCRIPT> tag.  I prefer this way, because the buttons will not appear at all if javascript is disabled.\n\tRemoved an extra copy of styles in ChangesFixedWidthStyle.css\n\tRemoved the alternative stylesheets <link> to the Fancy stylesheet (not necessary since it's the default stylesheet)\n\n ",
