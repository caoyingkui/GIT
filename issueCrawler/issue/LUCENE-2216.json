    "description": "OpenBitSet uses an internal buffer of long variables to store set bits and an additional 'wlen' index that points \nto the highest used component inside \n{@link #bits}\n buffer.\n\nUnlike in JDK, the wlen field is not continuously maintained (on clearing bits, for example). This leads to a situation when wlen may point\nfar beyond the last set bit. \n\nThe hashCode implementation iterates over all long components of the bits buffer, rotating the hash even for empty components. This is against the contract of hashCode-equals. The following test case illustrates this:\n\n\n// initialize two bitsets with different capacity (bits length).\nBitSet bs1 = new BitSet(200);\nBitSet bs2 = new BitSet(64);\n// set the same bit.\nbs1.set(3);\nbs2.set(3);\n        \n// equals returns true (passes).\nassertEquals(bs1, bs2);\n// hashCode returns false (against contract).\nassertEquals(bs1.hashCode(), bs2.hashCode());\n\n\n\nFix and test case attached.",

I just don't see the point in not updating wlen since you're scanning through memory anyway... The implementation of OpenBitSet is different in this regard to java.util.BitSet, which always maintains the last non-empty index. I've been thinking about it a bit and there are pros and cons to both implementations, but lazily moving wlen when memory is scanned anyway seems like a better alternative than keeping wlen unnecessarily large (which affects ORs, ANDs and other set operations).\n\nTo me this implementation cannot be used in a multi-threaded application anyway, am I wrong here?\n\nD.

I had some thoughts about it \u2013 this particular mutation seems to be \"safe\" even from multi-threaded point of view. If another thread sees a stale value of wlen, then the only thing that is going to happen is it will scan more memory; for ands, ors and other types of operations this will have no effect. So assuming hashCode/equals is the ONLY method you're calling concurrently, it shouldn't break things. A similar kind of trickery goes on in String#hashCode (caching to a non-volatile field), although that object is immutable, so it's a slightly different scenario.\n\nTo be honest, my preference for this would be to either maintain the wlen field during all operations (like java.util.BitSet) or at least to clearly state (JavaDoc?) that trimTrailingZeros() should be invoked prior to publishing the object for other threads for increased performance (in case you fiddle with bits and clear the tail). In the second options, your patch does a fine job of not mutating the object and correcting the bug.\n\nThanks for an interesting discussion. ",

If all threads only called hashCode and equals, then you might be right... it's very specific to the implementation of trimTrailingZeros()\n\n   public void trimTrailingZeros() {\n    int idx = wlen-1;\n    while (idx>=0 && bits[idx]==0) idx--;\n    wlen = idx+1;\n  }\n\n\nWhat could make that work is the fact that wlen is an integer, is never directly used as the loop counter, or as an index into the array.\n\nBut the other big questions: are other read operations tolerant of wlen changing out from under them?  My guess would be no.\nLook at xorCount for example:\n\n    if (a.wlen < b.wlen) {\n      tot += BitUtil.pop_array(b.bits, a.wlen, b.wlen-a.wlen);\n\n\nhashCode and equals changing wlen could cause a negative value to be passed to pop_array.\n\nedit: deleted second example, which isn't different from the first (the issue is safety with other read ops).
