    "description": "This means the user can configure a decimal value in replica\n\nexample :\n\n{\"replica\": 1.638, \"node\":\"#ANY\"}\n\n\nThis means a few things. The no:of of replicas in a node can be either 2 or 1. This also means that violations are calculated as follows\n\n\tIf the replica count is 1 or 2 there are no violations\u00a0\n\tIf the replica count is 3, there is a violation and the delta is 3-1.638 = 1.362\n\tif the replica count is 0, there is a violation and the delta is 1.638 - 0 = 1.638\n\tThis also means that the node with zero replicas has a more serious violation and the system would try to rectify that first before it address the node with 3 replicas",
