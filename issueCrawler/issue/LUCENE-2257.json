Checkindex worked with an index with 2.49 billion terms.\nI added commas to the output below:\n test: terms, freq, prox...OK [2,487,224,745 terms; 23,573,976,855 terms/docs pairs; 97,223,318,067 tokens]\n\nWe are working on determining how to test it with Solr.  The ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception appears in the logs about for about 1 in every 100 queries.   We haven't been able to determine which queries trigger the problem.\n\nWe are using an older version of Solr with lucene 2.9-dev 779312 - 2009-05-27 17:19:55 .  I'm not sure if we can just drop in a later version of lucene with the patch or if I need to patch the older 2.9 dev lucene version that came with our Solr.   What do you suggest?\n\nWhat I'm thinking of is to run 10,000 queries against our dev server pointing at one of the large segment indexes  with and without the patch.\n\nTom\n\n ",

I'd recommend checking out that exact revision of Lucene (svn co -r779312 ...), applying this patch, building a JAR, and replacing Solr's Lucene JAR with this one.\n\nIt's only queries that contain terms above the 2.1B mark (your last ~390 M terms) that will hit the exception.  Once you find such a query it should always hit the exception on this large segment. ",

(I discovered that queries containing Korean characters would consistently trigger the bug).   With the patch, we don't see any ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exceptions.  We are going to do a bit more testing before we put this into production. (We rolled back our production indexes temporarily to indexes that split the terms over 2 segments and therefore didn't trigger the bug).\n\nOther than walking though the code in the debugger, is there some systematic way of looking for any other places where an int is used that might also have problems when we have over 2.1x billion terms?\n\nTom ",

And the results look correct?\n\nOther than walking though the code in the debugger, is there some systematic way of looking for any other places where an int is used that might also have problems when we have over 2.1x billion terms?\n\nNot that I know of!  The code that handles the term dict lookup is\nfairly contained, in TermInfosReader and SegmentTermEnum.  I think\nscrutinizing the code and testing (as you're doing) is the only way.\n\nI just looked again \u2013 there are a few places where int is still being used.\n\nFirst is two methods (get(int position) and scanEnum), in\nTermInfosReader, that are actually dead code (package private &\nunused).  Second is int SegmentTermEnum.scanTo, but this is fine\nbecause it's never asked to can more than termIndexInterval terms.\n\nI'll attach patch that additionally just removes that dead code. ",
