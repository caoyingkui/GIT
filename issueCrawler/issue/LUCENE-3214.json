    "description": "This is a hacked up prototype!  It works but I'm not sure how to get this to a committable point.\n\nThe patch invokes mlock() (tested only on Linux), locking pages from the terms dictionary file that hold terms for a specified field.  You can only do this with MMapDirectory.\n\nI used this to lock pages for the \"id\" field in the NRT stress test; it's an alternative to MemoryCodec.  But, it requires you set up the OS to allow the app/user to lock pages in RAM.\n\nIt works very well in reducing the NRT reopen latency even when large merges are running...",
