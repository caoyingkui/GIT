If you mean the SolrHttpRequestRetryHandler then it is on by default unless someone disables it. The HttpClientUtil has the following in the setupBuilder method:\n\n    if (config.getBool(HttpClientUtil.PROP_USE_RETRY, true)) {\n      retBuilder = retBuilder.setRetryHandler(new SolrHttpRequestRetryHandler(3));\n\n    } else {\n      retBuilder = retBuilder.setRetryHandler(NO_RETRY);\n    }\n\n\n\nIn any case, I'll remove the explicit enabling of retry in UpdateShardHandler and commit the patch. Please open an issue if you think there is still a problem. ",
