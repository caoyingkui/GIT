    "description": "We have an solrcloud environment with 28 solr shards in \"compositeId\" mode. We found an issue that facet.limit impact the facet results when group.facet=true\n\nIn our query, when facet.limit=50, the facet result count will return not grouped count even we add group.facet=true. Please see attached \"picture1\" which is in distrib query, the facet.query field return correct grouped count (8), while the facet results return un-grouped count (233).\n\nWhile If I add \"distrib=false\", which mean searching for the single shard that contains the documents in that same shard, the results are correct, please see attached \"picture2\".\n\nIn additional, if I increase the facet.limit to 1000 with the same query even in distrib mode (distrib=true), I could also get the correct grouped facet results.\n\nJiaJun",
