    "description": "Currently this throws an exception, but I think it should unpack any pom templates it needs from the artifacts themselves.\n\n\n\tits nice to be able to generate and test RC's without having an official branch yet. I am currently doing this just to\n  move us closer to release (just trying to find bugs etc). Also anyone should be able to just toss up an RC at any time.\n\tits better to test the artifacts themselves rather than anything in SVN. At the least the -src jars have an svn export\n  so this should work... if it doesn't, then there is a packaging bug.",
