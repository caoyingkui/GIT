    "description": "Saw this on the user list and thought it might be a nice feature to add. I\nwasn't sure if there would be an objection to modifying Hits to extend\nAbstractList, so I implemented it both as a separate wrapper class and by making\nthe current Hits object extend AbstractList.\n\nThere is a separate patch for each. Only one should be applied, I'll leave it to\nthe more experienced folks to vote on which one should be used (if it should be\nused at all). My preference is for the modification to the Hits object.\n\nEric\n\ncopied from Tatu's message on the Lucene user list...\n\nOn Monday 06 October 2003 08:35, Lars Hammer wrote:\n...\n> to iterate the Hits.
