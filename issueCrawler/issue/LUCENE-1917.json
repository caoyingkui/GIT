    "description": "By default ShingleFilter creates shingles (i.e. combines tokens\ninto a single token) from all tokens. For the purposes of for\nexample, indexing stop words as shingles, however not creating\nshingles out of every word, we can supply an include words\nCharArraySet to ShingleFilter that determines the tokens to\nshingle. \n\nThis is similar to Nutch CommonGrams and SOLR-908. SOLR-908\ndoes not utilize the new token attribute API, and I figured this\nfunctionality is more suitable being a part of Lucene.",
