We should add BlockJoinChildQParser and BlockJoinParentQParser. \n\nAlso we should add an example on how to index childDocs in XML to make use of BlockJoin in Solr.",

Thanks so much for putting this together.\n\nYour document is clear, but I have one question. Could I use any field to indicate a parent document? For example, your example uses 'content_type' with a string value, but could it just as easily be a boolean? If I use a different field than your example, that is the field I would use in the <allParents> part of the syntax example, correct?\n\nThe only additional thing that should be added is if there are any concerns for performance, or other limitations, that users of this feature should be aware of.
