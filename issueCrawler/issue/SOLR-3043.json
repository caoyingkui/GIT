    "description": "When running Solr 3.5 with Tomcat6 on Fedora 15 in a basic multicore configuration with this solrconfig.xml (from the Drupal project): \n\nhttp://drupalcode.org/project/apachesolr.git/blob/b824140370ee69efcd105efd5fc510c1f17febcb:/solr-conf/solrconfig-solr3x.xml\n\nI get a NullPointerException:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/25c12d74d1b1f0e43625\n\nIt may be that there is bunk in that config, but it works fine in the same system with a vanilla single-core setup. Also, it doesn't seem like a config change should result in that kind of fatal error.\n\nI can try and provide more info, but am sadly not a Java developer.",
