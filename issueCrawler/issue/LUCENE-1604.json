One turns off norms to avoid huge arrays getting allocated, in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a break in back compatibility, though I think in 3.0 this change would be OK.  Perhaps, we could commit it today, w/ a deprecated method exposed in IndexReader to \"allow null to be returned by getNorms()\", which defaults to off (ie the current trunk behavior).  Then, in 3.0, we remove that method and hardwire to true.\n\nThere is also a [presumably smallish] performance hit by adding the \"norms != null\" check inside TermScorer, for every hit, but I think that's an OK tradeoff.

We could leverage this by not checking for null, but catch a null pointer exception, though I believe the extra overhead of a try/catch block would be more expensive than just checking.\n\nThe performance hit is likely only in the case where it isn't equal null - in the equal null case you end up saving a multiply plus a memory reference that is likely going to cause many CPU cache faults over the coarse of a search long enough to matter, which together probably add up to more than the cost of the check.\n\nAn alternate approach that would eliminate this overhead is to subclass the scorers that use norms and create an appropriate scorer that doesn't require the check. The drawback of this approach would be that it is harder to maintain.\n ",

Guys at MG4J generate a custom indexReader for each possible combination of index settings. So the idea of separate scorers might be valid, if we're going optimization-freak way.

I haven't found a single write to the map outside of initialize().\n\nYou mean the SegmentReader.Norm class?  It's so only one thread attempts to load norms at once.  And because cloned SegmentReaders share norms (incRef/decRef).  Also, the reader can change norms (setNorm) which requires copy-on-write if more than one clone is sharing the norms.  We'll need similar care for CSFs once they accept live changes, too.\n\nSomebody recently raised a topic on specialized Lucene\n\nRight, that's LUCENE-1594.  I'll fold the norms/nonorms code gen into there....\n\nSource code specialization gives sizable search performance gains w/ Lucene, but it'll be quite a while before it's committable.  Hopefully as we pull some of the optimizations there back into core (eg using random-access API to filter: LUCENE-1536), that gap shrinks.\n\nLet's proceed for now with the null check in single-source scorer.  I'll run some perf tests on it vs trunk, with the \"norms present\" case, to see where we stand. ",
