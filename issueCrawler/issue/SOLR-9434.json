    "description": "All the search requests are failing during the window spellcheck index is built while using AnalyzingInfixSuggester\n\nObserved in Solr 4.6.1\n\nReproducible steps:\n1. Initialized spellcheck component with AnalyzingInfixLookupFactory\n2. Consider the collection \"test_suggest\" (if not create one)\n3. Lets have a dictionary file 'dictionary_a.txt' with size in MBs (~10MB). Each line contains a word (max 20char).\n4. Now, do the following two things parallel,\n\n\tbuild the index : GET http://<solrhost>:<port>/solr/test_suggest/suggest_handler?spellcheck.build=true\n\tdo the search : GET http://<solrhost>:<port>/solr/test_suggest/suggest_handler?q=dr\nResponse : All the search requests are failing during the window spellcheck index is built.\n\n\n\nSample Configuration: \n<searchComponent name=\"suggest\" class=\"solr.SpellCheckComponent\">\n  <lst name=\"spellchecker\">\n    <str name=\"name\">suggest_a</str>\n    <str name=\"lookupImpl\">org.apache.solr.spelling.suggest.fst.AnalyzingInfixLookupFactory</str>\n    <str name=\"indexPath\">./index/analyzingSuggesterIndex_a</str>\n    <str name=\"suggestAnalyzerFieldType\">text_general</str>\n    <str name=\"sourceLocation\">./dictionaries/dictionary_a.txt</str> \n  </lst>\n</searchComponent>\n<requestHandler name=\"/suggest_handler\" class=\"org.apache.solr.handler.component.SearchHandler\">\n  <lst name=\"defaults\">\n    <str name=\"spellcheck\">true</str>\n    <str name=\"spellcheck.dictionary\">suggest</str>\n    <str name=\"spellcheck.count\">30</str>\n    <str name=\"spellcheck.onlyMorePopular\">true</str>\n  </lst>\n  <arr name=\"components\">\n    <str>suggest</str>\n  </arr>\n</requestHandler>",
