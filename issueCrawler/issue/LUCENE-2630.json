    "description": "as part of improved testing, i thought it would be a good idea to make the build (ant test) more friendly\nto working under apache harmony.\n\ni'm not suggesting we de-optimize code for sun jvms or anything crazy like that, only use it as a tool.\n\nfor example:\n\n\tbugs in tests/code: for example i found a test that expected ArrayIOOBE\n  when really the javadoc contract for the method is just IOOBE... it just happens to\n  pass always on sun jvm because thats the implementation it always throws.\n\tbetter reproduction of bugs: for example 2 months out of the year\n  it seems TestQueryParser fails with thai locale in a difficult-to-reproduce way.\n  but i always get similar failures like this with harmony for this test class.\n\tbetter stability and portability: we should try (if reasonable) to avoid depending\n  upon internal details. the same kinds of things that fail in harmony might suddenly\n  fail in a future sun jdk. because its such a different impl, it brings out a lot of interesting stuff.\n\n\n\nat the moment there are currently a lot of failures, I think a lot might be caused by this: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.harmony.devel/39484",
