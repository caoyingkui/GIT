    "description": "The Token class should be more friendly to classes not in it's package:\n  1) add setTermText()\n  2) remove final from class and toString()\n  3) add clone()\n\nSupport for (1):\n  TokenFilters in the same package as Token are able to do things like \n   \"t.termText = t.termText.toLowerCase();\" which is more efficient, but more importantly less error prone.  Without the ability to change only the term text, a new Token must be created, and one must remember to set all the properties correctly.  This exact issue caused this bug:\nhttp://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-437\n\nSupport for (2):\n  Removing final allows one to subclass Token.  I didn't see any performance impact after removing final.\nI can go into more detail on why I want to subclass Token if anyone is interested.\n\nSupport for (3):\n\n\tsupport for a synonym TokenFilter, where one needs to make two tokens from one (same args that support (1), and esp important if instance is a subclass of Token).",

            "content": "Mostly to convey information across TokenFilters, and the single type string isn't sufficient.\nFor exampe, I'd like to have an int or long that can be used as 32 or 64 independent flags.\n\nIn general, having attributes you can dynamically attach to tokens allows to you decompose token filters to more basic functions and thus gives greater power to filter chains.\n\nSome use cases I can think of:\n\n\tconditionals... mark tokens in one filter and conditionally act on them in another.\n\n\n\n\n\tdecouple the marking of tokens from the transformation of tokens... one could have a\n  TokenMatcherFilter that would tag certain tokens that matched a regex, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\tprotected tokens: mark certain words as \"do not change\", \"do not stem\", \"do not lowercase\" for instance.\n\n\n\n\n\tmark tokens that are split from a larger token (for example when a camelCase filter splits \"fooBar\" into \"foo Bar\") so they may be treated differently by other filters\n\n\n\n\n\tperformance (hey it comes for free).  You can do things like StandardTokenFilter, which checks the type of the token and doesn't have to re-parse every single token.\n\n\n\nI've already had to implement TokenFilter functionality (protected tokens, token splitting and combining)  where I've had to stuff more functionallity than I'd like into a single filter because of then inability of one filter to provide more info to another.\n\nSo I think there's a strong case for being able to dynamically add attributes (set bit flags) on a token.  I planned on subclassing Token to achieve that.  But because I don't know what other people may need/want in the future, making it so one can provide extensions to Token via inheritance seems like a good thing.\n ",

There is no reason not to make it non-final if there isn't a performance impact.\n\nIn my general experience with recent hotspot JVMs, final on classes almost never make a difference.  \"final\" applied to variables, however, can still make a big difference.  I think the JVMs can tell if there are any loaded subclasses, and if not, treat it as final.\n\nIn the context of indexing, I couldn't detect any difference in speed.  I'll try and isolate it more.
