    "description": "Before SOLR-7166, users could create a MiniSolrCloudCluster with extra filters by specifying their own SortedMap and comparator (since Class<? extends Filter> is not comparable).  JettyConfigs allow you to specify filter classes to add, but they don't work because JettyConfigs manages its own filter map using TreeMap.  Thus, there is no way to specify a comparator and it fails at runtime with \"Class cannot be cast to java.lang.comparable.\"",
