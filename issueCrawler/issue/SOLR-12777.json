    "description": "When starting solr, an optional -d parameter can be provided.\u00a0 This specifies the \"Solr server directory\" which needs to be the server directory from the raw distribution.\u00a0 This clearly contains the program files, so as per common practice should not be writable by the user running the program.\u00a0 However, when specified,\u00a0an error results because it tries to create a log directory within the program directory!  This is really really bad practice.  One should be able to specify a directory for the runtime files and log files on the command line.  It would be even better if the defaults conformed to the filesystem hierarchy standard when run on a Linux system.  I understand that you want to make it easy for developers to use your software, but when deploying on actual production systems, these things are really important.  It's also important to understand that the people deploying your software to production are different to the ones who develop with your software, and a deep understanding of your software shouldn't be necessary for the former to be able to deploy it.\n\nA wholly-unsatisfactory workaround is to set the pid and log directories by environment variable before starting the server:\n\n$ export SOLR_PID_DIR=/var/lib/celum-search\n$ export SOLR_LOGS_DIR=/var/log/celum-search\n\nThis can also be done in /etc/default/solr.in.sh.",

All of this is works as documented in https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_4/taking-solr-to-production.html\u00a0and thus do not classify as a bug. The linux installer configures these\u00a0and gives you a R/O server directory by default.\n\nI'm not completely sure what you are proposing with this JIRA?

            "content": "Hi Jan H\u00f8ydahl, thanks for the response and apologies in advance for this rambling reply.\n\nSo, documented or not, I think it's a really strange default to put the pid file and logs alongside the program files.  This might very well be normal on Windows, but in the Linux world, it's really not normal at all, especially in production systems.\n\nLike most serious sysadmins, I won't run installers on prod systems since they can install files all over the system in an untracked way, which might be fine for developers, but is not tenable on well-maintained production systems.  We generally use system packages (i.e. .deb and .rpm files) which track the files they install and are checked by the distribution teams to ensure they put the files in the correct places.  We also use puppet for any configuration of those packages, or for software that doesn't have packages available.  This allows us to be systematic about what software is installed on which machines.  These days, this is part of what is called \"DevOps\", but is historically just considered good practice.  Software that makes it hard to adhere to good practice is in my mind buggy and should be fixed.\n\nMy suggestion would be indeed firstly to add command-line options to specify the location of the logs and pids (that overrode the env vars).  One can specify other locations on the command line, so why not these too?\n\nMy second suggestion would be to work more with the distribution package maintainers to keep the versions of solr in the distros more up to date.  They will also likely have other great suggestions that will make solr more usable for non-distro users too, since they need to make the packages conform to standards like the FHS.  The distros can be quite strict with what they allow in, but that just adds exponentially to user trust. ",

I changed the issue to \"Improvement\" and the title to your primary suggestion \"Add bin/solr args for specifying PID and LOGS dirs\".\n\nI agree that it would be great to have deb and rpm packages but until now the project has delegated that to be produced downstream by the wider ecosystem. You could always suggest that the project should own the release process of such packages too (as we do with zip, tgz, maven) but for that to work there will have to be committers available with both knowledge and interest of doing that work. There are already volunteers\u00a0maintaining \"brew\" packages for macOS and \"chocolatey\" packages for Windows. ",

The rest of the install directory is owned by root.  The \"var dir\" and all its contents are owned by the service user.\n\nThe pidfile ends up in the \"var dir\" with the service installer, which defaults to /var/solr if not changed.\n\nWhen Solr is started without installing it, chances are good that all the files will be owned by the user that starts it, but this is completely outside our ability to control.
