    "description": "This introduces a new BBoxField configured like so:\n\n    <fieldType name=\"bbox\" class=\"solr.BBoxField\"\n               numberType=\"tdouble\" units=\"degrees\"/>\n\n\nIt's a field type based on the same backing as the other Solr 4 spatial field types (namely RPT) and thus it inherits the same way to use it, plus what is unique to this field.  Ideally, the numberType would point to double based field type configured with docValues=true but that is not required.  Only TrieDouble no float yet.\n\nThis strategy only accepts indexed rectangles and querying by a rectangle.  Indexing a rectangle requires WKT:\nENVELOPE(-10, 20, 15, 10) which is minX, maxX, maxY, minY (yeah, that 'y' order is wacky but it's not my spec).  This year I hope to add indexing ['lat,lon' TO 'lat,lon'] but it's not in there yet.\n\nTo query using it's special area overlap ranking, you have to use the special 'score' local-param with a new value like so:\nq={!field f=bbox score=overlapRatio queryTargetProportion=0.25}Intersects(ENVELOPE(10,25,12,10))\n\nThe queryTargetProportion defaults to 0.25 to be roughly what GeoPortal uses (although GeoPortal actually has a different formula).  This default weights 1 part query factor to 3 parts target factor.\n\nAdd debug=results to see useful \"explain\" info.",

Still limited to doubles though.\n\tNew score=area & score=area2D options to return the area of the indexed shape. It's generally computed geodetically, but area2D uses simple & fast math (simply width * height) which is usually plenty good enough.\n\tscore=overlapRatio is the new name for the former areaOverlap (or whatever I called it) algorithm.  And it has a new minSideLength local-param option.\n\n "

Tests were working because in 5x Solr uninverts automatically in the absence of DocValues.  On 4x, DocValues is a requirement for any distance/overlap/area related relevancy.  I'm not interested in adding complexity to switch between FieldCache vs DocValues APIs.  On trunk DocValues is recommended but not necessary.\n\nTODO: Documentation in the ref guide. "
