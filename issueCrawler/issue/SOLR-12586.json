    "description": "We're using Joda Time, a dependency in a couple places. \u00a0Now that we are on Java 8, we ought to drop the dependency, using the equivalent java.time package instead. \u00a0As I understand it, Joda time more or less was incorporated to Java as java.time with some fairly minor differences.\n\nUsages:\n\n\tConfigSetService\n\tParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory\n\n\n\nAnd some related tests.\n\n\nNote this is a fairly impactful change due to a change in the pattern language.  Here are the \"upgrade notes\" in changes.txt:\nThe date format patterns used by ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory (present in \"schemaless mode\")\n  are now interpreted by Java 8's java.time.DateTimeFormatter instead of Joda Time.  The pattern language is very\n  similar but not the same.  Typically, simply update the pattern by changing an uppercase 'Z' to lowercase 'z' and\n  that's it.  For the current recommended set of patterns in schemaless mode, see \"Schemaless Mode\" in the ref guide.",
