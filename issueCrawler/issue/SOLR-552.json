    "description": "This is related to, but not exactly the same as SOLR-544 and SOLR-470.\n\nWhen DateMath was introduced in Solr 1.2 a SimpleDateFormat was introduced for formating Date objects as \"internal\" String values that (erroneously) include trailing zeros in milliseconds when the number of millis is divisible by 10.  (ie: \"2008-04-27T23:38:22.120\" instead of \"2008-04-27T23:38:22.12\"\n\nthis makes it incorrect when doing lexigraphical comparisons with dates provided as strings by clients that follow the spec correctly (see SOLR-544)",
