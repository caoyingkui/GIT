            "content": "I wouldn't expect to see any progress here any time soon.  The underlying problem is that the FieldCache architecture is single-valued. Lucene needs a solution to rectify that. From what I hear, grand plans to rectify this FieldCache limitation in the past have failed (I don't know why).  But even if this hurdle was resolved, it'd only be half the battle. geodist() & geofilt() code is built around the notion of multiple fields supplying the lat & lon (VectorValueSource or something like that), not around it coming from a single field.  This limitation is at the core of these functions.\n\nBy comparison, I've found working on the \"Lucene-Spatial-Playground\" (temporary name) a breath of fresh air. Multi-valued fields is not in the FieldCache; we have a spatial substitute for that. And we don't use geodist() & geofilt() at all. "

            "content": "I re-labelled this issue to focus on geodist().  \n{!geofilt}\n, as of v4.2 works with the multi-valued capable field: SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType (RPT for short).\n\nWhat I previously commented on, regarding a multiValued FieldCache was implemented already in Lucene 4.2 but making geodist() work for RPT as well as LatLonType isn't so much related to that actually.\n\nIt'd be a real hack to make geodist() work with RPT, as geodist() internally has very different expectations about how points are obtained per-document, between how LatLonType works and how the Lucene spatial Strategy abstraction works (what's underneath RPT).  However, I'm increasingly inclined to think the hack would be worth it from a developer ease-of-use point of view.  I'll keep this issue on my TODO-list radar. "
