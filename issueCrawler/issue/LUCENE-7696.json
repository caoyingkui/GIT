Tika already have such a link, and hadoop already has a complete set of artifacts in their main repo.",

So it is only those that dig for archived versions inside dist/lucene that will ever land here, no route from the TLP sites...\n\nThe Hadoop TLP issue is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-1477\nThe Mahout TLP issue is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2643\nThe Tika TLP issue is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2692 but it does not mention archives\nThe Nutch TLP issue is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2693, no discussion about archives\n\nSuggest I start by sending an email to dev@tika (DONE), then see what they say before we tackle the other projects.

For the archive I'll follow-up with Nutch to ask if they want to write a few words on their download site about the oldest releases being found in the lucene area.\n\nI'll rewrite the issue description to focus on the dist area and the mirrors that people normally see, e.g. http://www.apache.org/dist/lucene/\nHere, hadoop is no longer there, but mahout, nutch and tika folders are .htaccess redirects. Assuming these are no longer needed, I plan to remove them. ",
