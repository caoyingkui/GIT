    "description": "Idea is to allow Solr-Cell to \"calculate\" the human content-type from the extracted content-type and map it to a field in the schema. \n\nSo the user can search on \"media: image\" or \"media:video\"\n\nIdea :\n1) Hardcode a hashmap in somewhere in extraction classes and get human content-type from extracted content-type. I Think to SolrContentHandler.java\n2) Write an xml file where we can put a mapping like in tika-config.xml for parsers\n3) Use tika-config.xml to get all supported mime-types",
