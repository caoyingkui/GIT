I have not fully tested to make sure the default behavior is the same as it was before, but a quick look at the example seems reasonable.\n\nThis changed:\n  log.finest  -> log.trace\n  log.fine -> log.debug\n  log.warning -> log.warn\n  log.severe -> log.error\n  (info stays the same)\n\nThe only bit I was not sure how to translate is in SolrRequestParsers.java:\n\n  log.throwing(getClass().getName(), \"getTransformer\", tce);\n\n\n\nfor now, i just used:\n\n log.error( getClass().getName() + \" getTransformer\", tce );\n\n\n\nAdditionally, wherever I noticed it, I used slf4j style \"formatters\":\nhttp://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance\nbut we may want to make a more through review  "

It might be desirable to change the log level names in the log level selector to match the names in SLF4J however.\n\nFrom the SLF4J FAQ:\n\"SLF4J is only a facade, meaning that it does not provide a complete logging solution. Operations such as [...] setting logging levels cannot be performed with SLF4J.\" "

So I did a replace-all regexp on all the source to unexpand these down to just $Id$ and then I could apply the patch. "
