    "description": "I have been checking the effect of the testPoint on GeoComplexPolygon and it seems performance can change quite a bit depending on the choice.\u00a0\n\nThe results with random polygons with 20k points shows that a good choice is to ue the center of mass of the shape. On the worst case the performance is similar to what we have now and the best case is twice as fast for\u00a0within() and\u00a0getRelationship() methods.\n\nTherefore I would like to propose to use that point whenever possible.",
