            "content": "I do see one issue here. First let me say I'm all for removing stopwords (+1, just to see if it's only a plus sign in the leading position that seems to get stripped lately). For that matter I'm also in favor of removing all the extra languages etc and super-especially the things like elevate that break startup.... OK, enough ranting.\n\nI usually recommend to clients when they upgrade that they take the configs from the new version and copy/paste their changes over from their old configuration rather than just carry their old ones forward to a new version, especially when they're moving to a new major version.\n\nThis is going to bite them a bit as it's likely they'll overlook something like removing stopwords for the fields they use \"as is\", which many do (text_en comes to mind).\n\nThat said bout the max I'd advocate is a comment in the configs or maybe the upgrade notes in CHANGES.txt to the effect of \"compare your schema definitions carefully since stopwords have been removed\". Well, something better than that but you get the idea. I suppose it's one more incentive to re-index. ",
