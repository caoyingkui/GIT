    "description": "Influential observations are outliers that have a large effect on the slope of a regression line. It is very useful to be able to automatically remove influential observations prior to running a simple regression.\n\nSyntax:\n\nregress(colA, colB, 10)\n\n\n\nThe function above regresses colA and colB after removing the top 10 influential observations from the data set.\n\nThe approach taken will be to remove each observation one and at a time and re-run the regression on the data set minus the observation. After each run the difference in model fit will be recorded. After completing the regression runs, N observations that had the highest difference of fit will be removed from the data set. The final regression will be run without those observations.",
