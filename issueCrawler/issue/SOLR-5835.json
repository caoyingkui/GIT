    "description": "We recently made how the Overseer processes state updates more efficient by removing a poll sleep - now, if updates come in faster than one every 100ms, the Overseer will just rip through them in a batch - but it won't update the clusterstate until done. We should only batch up to a certain number of updates or for a certain length of time before we publish the updated state so that tons of updates in the queue don't delay update visibility an unknown amount of time.",
