    "description": "The situation is this the following:\n\n1. SolrCloud with one shard and two Solr instances.\n2. Indexation via SolrJ with CloudServer and a custom BinaryLBHttpSolrServer that uses BinaryRequestWriter to execute correctly atomic updates. Check JIRA-4080.\n3. An asynchronous proccess updates partially some document fields. After that operation I automatically execute a commit, so the index must be reloaded.\n\nWhat I have checked is that both using atomic updates or complete document reindexations random documents are not updated even if I saw debugging how the add() and commit() operations were executed correctly and without errors. In other words, something strange happens when you both index and update documents asynchronously at the same time.\n\nAlso, if I debug line  by line (blocking other indexation/update proccesses) and I check with my own eyes when an index operation is done, I confirm that the document itself updates correctly.\n\nWhat I think is that there is some critical problem with both SolrCloud and CloudSolrServer interface that has something to do with index blocking while writing and forwarding document updates to replicas.\n\nIf I\u00b4m right, and considering also JIRA-4080, I would not recommend SolrCloud in production at the moment.",
