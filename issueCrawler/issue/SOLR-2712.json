    "description": "SOLR-2657 points out that all fields show up when you request score and something becides a 'normal' field.  To support the strange behavior and avoid it when uncenessary we have this:\n\n    if( fields.size() == 1 && _wantsScore && augmenters.size() == 1 && globs.isEmpty() ) {\n      _wantsAllFields = true;\n    }\n\n\n\nI suggest we advertise in 3.x that expecting fl=score to return all fields is deprecated, and remove this bit of crazy code from 4.x",
