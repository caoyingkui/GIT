When a core fails to load, the admin UI puts up a big red error box with messages like \"core collection_shard1_replica1 failed to load\"\n\nThen at the bottom something like:\nlook at the log file for additional information.\n\nThe trouble is that the operations folks who have to respond to this aren't always the ones who, say, configured the log file location in log4j. Printing the path to the log file directory would help.",
