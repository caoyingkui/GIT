The consensus is that the way sortMissingFirst is done in 3x is superior to 4x and when that is done (see LUCENE-3443) then the sortMissingFirst code should be incorporated into both.\n\nAs of now, however, the Trie fields in 4.0 support sortMissingFirst but not yet in 3.x",

The insanity reported at http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/lucene-dev?date=2011-11-11#l208 looks correct (and should be allowed), but maybe there is something else still using the StringIndex cache.

            "content": "I think this is ready to commit if we clear one thing up. Look at the tests and you'll see that default sorting for dates is a special case. The sorting behavior for dates is, indeed, different from longs when sortMissingFirst/Last are not specified. The behavior is consistent with 3.3 (it was handy to test 3.3 rather than 3.4) however, so neither LUCENE-3443 nor this patch change sorting in this case.\n\nI'd like to commit this tomorrow (Sunday). Since the reconciliation process is a bit \"interesting\" between Mike's and my changes, I think that a patch for each is preferable, but we know I'm \"merge challenged\".\n\nNote also that Mike, as part of 3441, made the parallel set of changes for 4.x already. That said, I'm going to create a small 4.x patch that changes the example schema.xml and incorporates the date test from this patch. I'll attach that file to SOLR-2134 "
