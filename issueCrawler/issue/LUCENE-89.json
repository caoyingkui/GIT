    "description": "I've found that fuzzy search terms are case sensitive. For example, \"Adagio\" is calculated as having a levenshtein distance of 1 from \"adagio\". Of course, \"ADAGIO\" has a distance of 6, and would not get returned as a search result if searching for 'adagio~'.\n\nthe patch is trivial and I have it here:\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tlucene-1.2\\src\\java\\org\\apache\\lucene\\search\\FuzzyTermEnum.java\tSun Jun 09 13:47:54 2002\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tpatched\\src\\java\\org\\apache\\lucene\\search\\FuzzyTermEnum.java\tFri Mar 14 11:37:20 2003\n***************\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t77,83 ****\n          super(reader, term);\n          searchTerm = term;\n          field = searchTerm.field();\n!         text = searchTerm.text();\n          textlen = text.length();\n          setEnum(reader.terms(new Term(searchTerm.field(), \"\")));\n      }\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t77,83 ----\n          super(reader, term);\n          searchTerm = term;\n          field = searchTerm.field();\n!         text = searchTerm.text().toLowerCase();\n          textlen = text.length();\n          setEnum(reader.terms(new Term(searchTerm.field(), \"\")));\n      }\n***************\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t88,94 ****\n       */\n      final protected boolean termCompare(Term term) {\n          if (field == term.field()) {\n!

However, I am wondering if\nFuzzy Queries really ought to be case-sensitive.  They are supposed to be\n'fuzzy' after all.\nI think I'll apply your diff int he next few days, unless somebody disagrees\nbefore that.\n\nNow that I think about it, the same change should maybe be applied to Prefix and\nWildcard queries.  We still don't want those queries to go through the Analyzer\nfor the reasons indicated in the FAQ entry above, but a person searching for\nDogs* probably wants to see documents with dogs* terms as well.

            "content": "All queries are case sensitive, as is indexing.  Application code can, and\nusually does, lowercase tokens by using an analyzer that includes a lowercase\nfilter.  Similarly, strings in queries should usually be lowercased before being\npassed to query constructors.  This is usually done by a query parser.\n\nWe could change query constuctors to lowercase by default, and add new\nconstructors which take a flag indicating whether or not to lowercase.  But this\nwould break compatibility.  Somewhere there are no doubt developers who depend\non the default case sensitivity who would be distressed by this change. ",
