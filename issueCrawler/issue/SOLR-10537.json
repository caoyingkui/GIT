    "description": "SolrParams ought to have a toLocalParamsString method.  I needed such a thing while working on SOLR-10526 but I thought it deserved it's own issue.  In addition, this method needs to call QueryParsing.encodeLocalParamVal but that's in Solr core (not SolrJ) so I think it can be refactored/moved to ClientUtils.  I've wanted to call such a method before in client code and there was none.  Surprisingly it's only used by FacetComponent within Solr.",
