            "content": "One simple way to fix this would be to have IW disregard the MergePolicy if ever it asks to do a single-segment merge of a segment that had already been produced by merging for the current optimize call.\n\nBut... I don't really like this, as it could be some unusual MergePolicy out there sometimes wants to do such merging.\n\nSo I think a better solution, but API breaking to the MergePolicy, which is OK because it's @experimental, is to change the segmentsToOptimize argument; currently it's just a set recording which segments need to be optimized away.  I think we should change it to a Map<String,Boolean>, where the Boolean indicates whether this segment had been created by a merge in the current optimize session.  Then I'll fix our MPs to not cascade in such a case. ",

The alternative is that optimize is dangerous in the presence of index updates (i.e. applications should discontinue updates if they call optimize). ",

            "content": "Right, this has been the intended semantics of a background optimize for some time, ie, when it returns it only ensures that whatever was not optimized as of when it was called has been merged away.\n\nThis already works correctly for newly added docs, meaning if you continue adding docs / flushing new segments while the optimize runs, it knows that the newly flushed segments do not have to be merged away.\n\nBut for new deletions we are not handling it correctly, which leads to the forever running merges.
