For SOLR this means integrating\nIndexWriter.getReader and adding a way to replicate newly\ncreated segments that may not exist on the file system to other\nSOLR servers in an efficient way. \n\nI don't think replicating documents as is would be optimal as it\nrequires re-analyzing on the slaves which we should seek to\navoid.\n\nIssues:\n\n\n\tReplicate using the existing Java based non-script system that\nuses HTTP or create a protocol that uses sockets?\n\n\n\n\n\tLucene needs a more efficient way of adding these segments\n(LUCENE-1738)",
