    "description": "In the TransactionLog I see that there's some metadata for the document \u2013 it's ID and a version (a long).  Should the _version_ in the document be the same as this metadata (which gets there via UpdateCommand.getVersion ?  Sometimes the doc doesn't have a version field so lets assume it's 0 (same as UpdateCommand's default).  I added an assertion on write() that checks they are consistent and I found one test that failed (metadata=0, doc=1615316737550450688)  org.apache.solr.cloud.MigrateRouteKeyTest#multipleShardMigrateTest\n\n\n\tSo should they always be consistent?  If so...\n\tWe should assert this (I'll attach a quick 'n dirty patch of this)\n\tDocument UpdateCommand.getVersion\n\torg.apache.solr.handler.component.RealTimeGetComponent#getInputDocumentFromTlog is too complicated in taking AtomicLong as an \"out\" parameter.  If the caller wants the version, they should get it themselves from the document like any normal field.",
