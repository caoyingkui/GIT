    "description": "If an idiot such as myself tries to specify a filter or such that lives in a parent classloader, such as the system classloader of a servlet container, Solr will fail to load it. The JVM is prone to create an exception that mentions some Solr interface as being missing instead of the filter itself. It would be less confusing for the miscreant if Solr were to try/catch ClassNotFound and NoClassDefError and throw its own exception with the name of the thing specified in the schema included in the message.",
