            "content": "This patch fixes the issue.\n\nIn fact the whole check was wrong and really to fragile. The new approach is 100% safe:\n\n\tSeparately lookup the class before doing anything. If this throws any exception, then the component is really missing\n\tThen do the same checks as before (to actually check that instantiation works), but don't check the message. Its easier. The newInstance method throws IAE, which wraps a NoSuchMethodException -> so just check IAE#getCause()\n\n\n\nI will commit this fix to all three branches. ",
