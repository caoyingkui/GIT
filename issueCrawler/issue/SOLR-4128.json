    "description": "With a schema that includes a dynamic field that matches 'score' (e.g. s* or even just *) text response writers (json, python, etc...) will return score as an array, e.g.:\n\"score\": [\n17.522964\n]\n\nFor now, a workaround (courtesy of hoss) is adding a non-indexed, non-stored, non-multivalued 'score' field to schema.xml, e.g.:\n<field name=\"score\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"false\" stored=\"false\" multiValued=\"false\"/>\n\nNote that this will happen for anybody following the current (or older) example schema.xml where \"*\" was used to ignore undesired fields (from: SOLR-217):\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/example/solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml#L214",
