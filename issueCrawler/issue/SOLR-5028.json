    "description": "It seems to me that there are two bugs in the ShardHandlerFactoryCreation that cancel each other and it seems to be working with the old style solr.xml, but not with the \"new style\". ConfigSolrOldXml seems to be expecting the shardHandlerFactory with the xpath:\nsolr/shardHandlerFactory/@class\nInstead of solr/cores/shardHandlerFactory/@class as it used to be. This is never caught because in the CoreContainer the ShardHandlerFactory is initialized using \"configSolr.getConfig().getNode(\"solr/cores/shardHandlerFactory\", false);\" instead of \"configSolr.get(CfgProp.SOLR_SHARDHANDLERFACTORY_CLASS, null);\" or something like that. However, if you use the \"new style\" xml, the CoreContainer will still try to initialize the factory like that, and won't find the  SHF.",

I don't understand why the test I had for SolrProperties was not ported over to the \"new\" xml when the former was removed (added back here).\n\nBut there are still more problems.  Persistence right now assumes a flat hierarchy (the addAttrib function takes a single String->String map to fill).  This looks like SolrProperties stuff all over again.  shardHandlerFactory is a plugin, and it has arbitrary children.  Persistence should be getting the Node for shardHandlerFactory and copying it.  There should be no need to look for specific children like connTimeout or socketTimeout. "

Those enums are just for use as key values in the map, not for the paths so I think they should stay.\nYes, I know, but what I'm saying is that as the SHF receives an unknown set of parameters (because it's a plugin) you can't generate enum keys for everything. Instead of that, when someone needs to get information about the SHF configuration it'll need to get the Node (or the PluginInfo with Alan's patch). \"connTimeout\" and \"socketTimeout\" are arguments specific to the HttpShardHandlerFactory that other SHF implementations may or may not use. Also, HttpShardHandlerFactory accepts lots of other arguments and we are not providing keys for all of them. So it gets confusing, some arbitrary init params can be get using cfg.get(...) and some can't. \n\nRyan, Tom\u00e1s, could you try this out? Will work on a persistence patch next.\nI haven't tested it yet, but +1 on the changes you did. ConfigSolrXmlOld still populates the map with the wrong paths though.  "
