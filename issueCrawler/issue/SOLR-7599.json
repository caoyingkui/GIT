    "description": "I see many tests which blindly have distribSetUp and distribTearDown methods setting a variety of options and system properties that aren't required anymore. \n\nThis is because some base test classes have been refactored such that these options are redundant. In other cases, people have copied the structure of tests blindly instead of understanding what each parameter does.\n\nLet's try to remove the unnecessary config params from such tests.",

Only a few tests really need it.\n\tSetting system properties such as System.setProperty(\"numShards\", Integer.toString(sliceCount));\n\tcheckCreatedVsState \u2013 looks like it is always false across all tests.\n\n ",

There is no apparent link between this test and AbstractZkTestCase.SOLRHOME until I found that this property is used to setup ZK by the parent base test and that the auto-detected value of AbstractZkTestCase.SOLRHOME applies only to core tests and not solrj tests. I have put in this explanation as a comment in that method but we should try to un-entangle such things in another issue. ",

Better not to mix unrelated tests together in test class.\n\nI also noticed that DeleteLastCustomShardedReplicaTest is ignored on trunk but not on branch_5x. Since I haven't seen this test failing on branch_5x, I will re-enable this test on trunk and investigate if it fails again. ",
