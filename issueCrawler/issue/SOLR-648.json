Therefore,\nwhen the index is reloaded, but not built after starting solr, issuing a\nquery with the spellcheck.q parameter will cause a NullPointerException to\nbe thrown (SpellCheckComponent.java:158). Moving the analyzer logic to the\nconstructor seems to fix the problem.\"",

The changes are:\n\n\tThe signature of the init method is changed to init(NamedList, SolrCore)\n\tAll analyzer defining code is moved to AbstractLuceneSpellChecker#init from the build methods in IndexBasedSpellChecker and FileBasedSpellChecker.\n\n\n\nI'll add a test and then give another patch shortly.

It contains minor API change so you'll need to revisit the custom SolrSpellChecker implementation you had. I'd like to commit this asap so that I can continue with SOLR-622.\n\nAn alternate way would have been to change the signature of the SolrSpellChecker.reload method to take in atleast the SolrCore or the same params as the build method.
