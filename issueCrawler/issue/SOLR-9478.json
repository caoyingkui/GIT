    "description": "hello guys,\nI met a problem when i using the solrcloud mode. When the solr instance run delta-import, it may take \nsome time to be finished( my data source is mysql database). So during this time, the new added documents\nwill loss, the deltaQuery, i use SUBDATE(${dih.last_index_time}, INTERVAL 2 MINUTE), \nlet it run the delta-import 2 mins earlier than the last_index_time, if the delta-import's duration is 5 mins, it will loss the records at the first 3 mins.\n    Our servers doesn't use solr cloud mode before, we deal with this issue is tring to rewrite dataimport.properties file, \nquery the max(sys_time_stamp), which will help to record the max time stamp, and let the solr can run delta import standing \nby the time found in the file, of course, it will never miss docuements. \n   But now, we use solrcloud, the dataimport.properties is on the zookeeper, and we may have multiple collections for the \nsame core.how can i update the dataimport.properties file now in colleciton now? Do you have any solution to help record\n the max(sys_time_stamp) in dataimport.properties, rather than using the time of delta-import start to run?\n\nCheers",

            "content": "Yeah, we got the  same problem. We have two solr instance running on the same shard. ( actually we just have only one shard).\n\nWe are not using dataimport.properties which stored in zookeeper. Since it is difficult to figure out which collection we are using when use collection alias.\n\nWe are using cronjob to run delta import every single minute, but when a delta import running on solr instance. another delta import must wait for it until server free. Just for example , Sometimes it may takes about 3 minutes to finish delta import. So the data changed during this period are lost.\n\nIs there any better solutions to do delta import when solr running on cloud mode ?\n\nThanks\nMu\u1e25ammad T Jack ",
