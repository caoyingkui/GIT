    "description": "See the discussion at SOLR-12286 for a lot of background, but the short form is that logging calls of the form\n\nlog.info(\"somehting\" + \"something\");\nand\nlog.info(\"soemthing {}\", object.toString());\n\ngenerate useless garbage even when logging at a more restrictive level (say WARN), whereas\n\nlog.info(\"somehting {}\", \"something\");\nand\nlog.infl(\"soemthing {}\", object);\n\ndo not. The first form is something of a relic, and there are even some uses of the second.\n\nSo, let's tackle subsets of the source code as subordinate JIRAs",
