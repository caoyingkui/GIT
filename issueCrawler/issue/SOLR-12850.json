    "description": "If a SOLR node gets a corrupted checksum in its index, it will still report as \"healthy\" but all writes routing to that node will fail. Thus leading to a total write outage\u00a0 which is totally silent server side.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI think this behavior should report within the cluster status. I think \"Down\" is appropriate, and then that should lead to a recovery triggering. Perhaps though a new category of \"CorruptIndex\" or something is more appropriate. However it happens, I believe the right response is (a) release leader lock if held (b) once new leader is elected, copy that leader's index",
