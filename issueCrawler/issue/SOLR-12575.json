Please raise this question on the user's list at solr-user@lucene.apache.org, see: (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc) there are a lot more people watching that list who may be able to help and you'll probably get responses much more quickly.\n\nIf it's determined that this really is a code issue or enhancement to Solr and not a configuration/usage problem, we can raise a new JIRA or reopen this one.
