    "description": "Currently there are a number places that map function names to Streaming API classes.\n\nThe test cases, the StreamHandler and GraphHandler each selectively map functions. \n\nThis approach is unwieldy and leads to bugs like SOLR-9919.\n\nThis ticket will refactor this code so that function mappings are done in one place and the test cases will fail if a function is not mapped.",
