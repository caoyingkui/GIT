    "description": "We migrated from a perfectly healthy Solr 6.2.0 installation to Solr 6.4.1 and when switching Solr 6.4.1 into production, load-average and CPU trash - compare Solr6.4.1.png (which shows that CPU and load-average spike) with Solr6.2.0.png (very stable, predictable utilisation).\n\nMigration changes:\n\n\tChanged luceneMatchVersion from 6.2.0 to 6.4.1 and rebuild index\n\tChanged solr.SynonymFilterFactory to solr.SynonymFilterFactory\n\tRemoved defaultSearchField and replaced with df in solrconfig.xml\n\tRemoved solrQueryParser defaultOperator and replaced with q.op in solrconfig.xml\n\tIncreased heap from 3G to 4G via \"SOLR_JAVA_MEM=\"-Xms4G -Xmx4G\"\"\n\tOur GC tune remains unchanged:\n\nGC_TUNE=\"-XX:NewRatio=3 \\\n-XX:SurvivorRatio=4 \\\n-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=90 \\\n-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=8 \\\n-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC \\\n-XX:+UseParNewGC \\\n-XX:ConcGCThreads=4 -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 \\\n-XX:+CMSScavengeBeforeRemark \\\n-XX:PretenureSizeThreshold=64m \\\n-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly \\\n-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=50 \\\n-XX:CMSMaxAbortablePrecleanTime=6000 \\\n-XX:+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled \\\n-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled\"\n\n\n\tI noticed in jetty.xml new additions of \"InstrumentedQueuedThreadPool\" and \"InstrumentedHandler\" - unsure if this would affect CPU overloading?\n\n\n\nSince our production load is fairly static with regards to the index size (see Solr6.4.1-info-*.pngs) and since our current Solr 6.2.0 runs perfectly fine on the same version of CentOS and JDK I can only think that a change in Jetty or Solr/Lucene causes the trashing of CPU.\n\nI would like to assist with isolating/resolving the issue but am not sure what other diagnostic information is needed (nor have I seen similar reports elsewhere).",
