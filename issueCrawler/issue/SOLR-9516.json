Ishan's initial report was against 6.2, so it's not just the latest; IMO we can assume it's all 6.x releases, and maybe even 5.5.2 per another reporter.\n\nThere's a workaround for now - use the old UI - but if the old UI is removed, users with Kerberos auth will be unable to use the Admin UI.

Each browser supports this differently, and some (like Chrome) do not support it at all. If you see 401 errors when trying to access the Solr Admin UI after enabling Kerberos authentication, it's likely your browser has not been configured properly to know how or where to negotiate the authentication request.\n\nDetailed information on how to set up your browser is beyond the scope of this documentation; please see your system administrators for Kerberos for details on how to configure your browser.\n\nAre we - absolutely - sure that the exact same setup works with the old UI? Could we get full browser/network traces for a request made from old UI and from New UI? Preferably while the backend is actually running with full TRACE log. ",

Excluding them from authentication makes sense due to performance reasons, but this is just a workaround to some other potential problem with SDF/Kerberos.\n\nIf you're sure that other parts of UI also work fine (collections/core admin command buttons, zk/file tree etc.), then lets just commit the patch now and worry later as to why authentication wasn't working for /solr/lib endpoints (there could be some other problem with the way SDF works in certain cases).
