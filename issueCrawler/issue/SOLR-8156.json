    "description": "Bad user requests (eg syntax errors in queries) fill up solr logs with stacktraces, which makes tracking down actual errors much more difficult.\n\nError logging is handled in both RequestHandlerBase and HttpSolrCall at the moment.  HttpSolrCall tries to be a bit cleverer about it, only logging stacktraces for server errors.  I suggest we just remove the logging from RHB entirely.  This should also clear up some cases where errors get logged twice.",
