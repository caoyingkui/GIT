    "description": "It would be very handy if the CSV loader could handle a literal field mapping, like the extracting request handler does.  For example, in a scenario where you have multiple datasources (some data from a DB, some from file crawls, and some from CSV) it is nice to add a field to every document that specifies the data source.  This is easily done with DIH with a template transformer, and Solr Cell with ext.literal.datasource=, but impossible currently with CSV.",

I think for the sake of this feature, it's best to stick with the established Solr Cell convention.  Perhaps in another issue we can take up refactoring parameter naming for this capability.\n\nThoughts?  Objections?   I'll commit this to trunk once I hear Simon's signoff. "
