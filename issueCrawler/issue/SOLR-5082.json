This was discussed in SOLR-4265 and SOLR-4283.\n\nChanging the default charset is a bad idea because distributed search (SolrCloud) relies on UTF-8.",

The slowest part in the whole code is MultiMapSolrParams#add, because it reallocates arrays all the time on duplicate keys... "

If you made that change, I think ArrayList would perform better for this buffer than LinkedList. "
