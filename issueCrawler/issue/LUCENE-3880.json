            "content": "RFC 2368 describes URLs employing the mailto: scheme; this RFC has been obsoleted by RFC 6068, which describes the mailto: URI scheme.\n\nmailto: URIs can contain multiple email addresses, and fielded information including CC, BCC, Subject, and Body - in short, the entire contents of an email message.\n\nHowever, a significant proportion of (probably most) mailto: URIs in the wild contain just a single email address.  Short of handling all aspects of the mailto: scheme (out of scope for this issue), I think it would be useful to employ a trick similar to the charFilter hack described by Kai G\u00fclzau: explicitly split \"mailto:\" off from a following email address, allowing the email address to be recognized as such.
