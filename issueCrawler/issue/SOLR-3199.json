            "content": "Thanks Dawid - in this case it looks like the ZkControllerTest was setting the bootstrap_confdir sys prop and not clearing (it cleaned a couple other props, but missed that one). This caused an extra set of configuration files to be uploaded in a later test which counted on a feature where we auto choose the conf set for a collection if there is only one. There was two though.\n\nI've committed a fix. "
