    "description": "This issue occurs only when the data directory is deleted manually on the master instance.\n\nHere are the steps that I used to replicate the issue:\n\nMaster - Shutdown\nMaster - Delete Data Directory\nSlave - Replication triggers, but no connection to master, replicaiton fails\nMaster - Start Up\nMaster - Index all docs\nMaster - Shutdown\nMaster - Start Up\n\nExpected: Slave - Replication triggers, connected to master, new index replications, master & slave in sync\n\nActual:  Slave - Replication triggers, connected to master, error seen in the logs: \"SEVERE: No files to download for index generation: 2\"\n\n\n\tNothing will replicate even if master generation > slave generation\n\n\n\nWorkaround:\n\n\n\tMust trigger another commit on master after the restart\n\tReplicates even if master generation < slave generation (and gets the generations in sync)\n\tReplicates when master generation > slave generation",
