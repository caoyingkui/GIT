            "content": "As a result, discountOverlap is not initialized to true, and the default behavior is that multiple terms on the same position DO affect the fieldNorm. this is not the intended default.\n\nGrr... that really sucks \u2013 and seems easily confusing.\n\nMy concern about making this change as written in Isaac's patch is that it could cause some very weird inconsistencies for people who upgrade.\n\nMy suggestion would be to do the following...\n\n1) in DefaultSimilarityFactory, change the declaration of the discountOverlaps variable to default to true for cnsistency (seems like a good idea in general, even if we do fix the lifecycle to ensure init() gets called)\n2) in IndexSchema.java, where Isaac's patch currently fixes the hadcoded construction of a default instance of DefaultSimilarityFactory to always call init with empty SolrParams, make the params pased to the init param contingent on the value of the luceneMatchVersion \u2013 if it's less then 4.7, pass discountOverlaps=false to the init method for backcompat, and if it's 4.7 or greater pass an empty set of params (so the factories defaults are used correctly)\n3) write some tests using trivial solrconfig.xml+schema.xml files with hardcoded version match params to verify that the correct behavior is being implemented.\n\nthoughts?
