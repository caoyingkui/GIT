    "description": "Found this bug over on LUCENE-3969, but I'm currently tracking a ton of bugs, so\nI figure I would open an issue and see if this one is obvious to anyone:\n\nConsider this input string: \"gzw f quaxot\" (length = 12) with a WhitespaceTokenizer.\nIf i have mapping rules like this, then it works!:\n\n\"t\" => \"\"\n\n\n\nBut if I have mapping rules like this:\n\n\"t\" => \"\"\n\"tmakdbl\" => \"c\"\n\n\n\nThen it will compute final offset wrong:\n\n    [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: finalOffset  expected:<12> but was:<11>\n\n\n\nLooks like some logic/recursion bug in the correctOffset method? The second rule is not even \"used\" for this string,\nit just happens to also start with 't'",
