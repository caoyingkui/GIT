    "description": "The recently created bumpVersion.py attempts to create a new backcompat index if the default codec has changed.  However, we now want to create a backcompat index for every released version, instead of just when there is a change to the default codec.\n\nWe should have a separate script which creates the backcompat indexes.  It can even work directly on the released artifacts (by pulling down from mirrors once released), so that there is no possibility for generating the index from an incorrect svn/git checkout.",

            "content": "This patch does the following:\n\n\tRemoves CreateBackwardsCompatibilityIndex class, which was just to avoid tests from running the index creation methods.  Instead, it uses assumeTrue methods, and requires passing -Dtests.bwcdir when creating backcompat indexes.\n\tRenames all backcompat index files to contain the exact toString of their version, instead of a squash/minified variant.  This allows using Version parsing and comparison for checking all versions have a test (and for future tests, if needed as was in the past when older codecs did not support certain features).\n\tAdds addBackcompatIndexes.py script, which was extracted from bumpVersion.py\n\tTweaks TestBackwardsCompatibility.testAllVersionsTested to allow a single \"missing\" test, which could be when we are in the middle of releasing a new version (so tests don't break as soon as a new constant is added to Version)\n\n ",
