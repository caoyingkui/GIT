    "description": "When I tried to use the JiebaTokenizerFactory to index Chinese characters in Solr, it works fine with the segmentation when I'm using the Analysis function on the Solr Admin UI.\n\nHowever, when I tried to do the highlighting in Solr, it is not highlighting in the correct place. For example, when I search of \u81ea\u7136\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u672c\u8eab, it highlight \u8ba4<em>\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u73af</em><em>\u5883</em><em>\u4e0e\u4f01</em><em>\u4e1a\u672c</em>\u8eab\u7684\nEven when I search for English character like  responsibility, it highlight  <em> responsibilit<em>y.\n\nBasically, the highlighting goes off by 1 character/space consistently.\nThis problem only happens in content field, and not in any other fields.\n\nI've made some minor modification in the code under JiebaSegmenter.java, and the highlighting seems to be fine now.\n\nBasically, I created another int called offset2 under process() method.\nint offset2 = 0; \nAfter which, I modified the offset to offset2 for this part of the code under process() method. \nThe changes are in the attachment below.",
