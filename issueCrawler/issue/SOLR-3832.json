    "description": "The problem is that fields that point to classes go and collect the size recursively. On IBM a class object contains LOTS of references so it goes up to megabytes for a single enumset.\n\nAnother issue is that we count the same objects multiple times if they show up again referenced from different fields \u2013 we should be counting them once only.\n\nA temporary fix is to exclude enumsets from being counted.",
