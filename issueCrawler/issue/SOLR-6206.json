We only need to do the following:\n\n\n       try {\n         deleteCollection(new ZkNodeProps(props), results);\n+        clusterState = zkStateReader.getClusterState();\n       } catch (Exception e) {\n         log.warn(\"Unable to clean up existing temporary collection: \" + tempSourceCollectionName, e);\n       }\n\n\n\nWe just need to refresh the cluster state object after deleting the collection for re-tries to work. I'll commit this change. "
