    "description": "Hi,\n\nWe are trying to index documents of different types. Document have different fields. fields are known at indexing time. We run a query on a database and we index what comes using query variables as field names in solr. Our current solution: we use dynamic fields with prefix, for example feature_i_*, the issue with that\n1)  we need to define the type of the dynamic field and to be able to cover the type of discovered fields we define the following\n feature_i_* for integers, feature_t_* for string, feature_d_* for double, ....\n1.a) this means we need to check the type of the discovered field and then put in the corresponding dynamic field\n2) at search time, we need to know the right prefix\n\nWe are looking for help to find away to ignore the prefix and check of the type",
