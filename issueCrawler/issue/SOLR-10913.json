    "description": "Hey, I was trying to simulate gt function on old version of solr (5.5.0) using sub and max\n(afaik, gt is not available on 5.5.0)\n\nI found strange inconsistency for function queries (reproducible on 6.4.1 as well)\n\nFor simplest usecase, have at least 1 doc in solr collection and provide addition fl parameter:\nfl=*,max(0, 0.9), if(0, 1, 0), if(0.9, 1, 0), if(max(0, 0.9), 1, 0), if(max(0, 1.1), 1, 0)\n\nThe output is following:\n\n\"max(0, 0.9)\":0.9,\n\"if(0, 1, 0)\":0,\n\"if(0.9, 1, 0)\":1,\n\"if(max(0, 0.9), 1, 0)\":0,\n\"if(max(0, 1.1), 1, 0)\":1\n\n4th usecase seems strange to me and inconsistent to previous expressions as well.\nCould you clarify if it's a bug or I am doing something wrong.",
