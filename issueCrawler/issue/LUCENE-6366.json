    "description": "As noted by Eduard Moraru on the solr-user mailing list, the sample fieldtypes Solr provides for dealing with the Czech use \"cz\" as a fieldType, dynamicField, and stopwords file naming convention \u2013 but \"cz\" isn't the language code for Czech \u2013 the correct langauge code is \"cs\".\n\nSolr's naming convention here comes directly from the lucene analysis package name for the Czech analysis classes: org.apache.lucene.analysis.cz; so before making any changes in the Solr sample configs (SOLR-7267), we should probably clarify if/why the lucene package name is like this.",
