    "description": "I'm developing an application on android and I'm using lucene for indexing and searching. When I try to use AnalyzingSuggester (even the Fuzzy version) I got an Exception the BufferedOutputStream is already closed.\nI tracked the problem and it seems that in\norg.apache.lucene.search.suggest.Sort\nand in org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.analyzing.AnalyzingSuggester\nthe outputstream is closed twice hence the exception on android. \nThe same code on windows runs without a problem.\nIt seems that the Android jvm does some additional checks. I attach two patche files, the classes close the output stream once. (check for writerClosed in the code to see what I did)",

            "content": "This is not a bug in Lucene. The Java Closeable interface is idempotent, as its documentation states in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Closeable.html#close():\n\nCloses this stream and releases any system resources associated with it. If the stream is already closed then invoking this method has no effect.\n\nIf the implementation on Android does not implement this correctly, it is not a problem of Lucene.\n\nJust to check if there is no other problem: Can you post the exact stack trace of the Exception on Android?\n\nP.S.: Please note: Android is not Java compatible, so Lucene does not gurantee that it work correctly with Android. We also don't test on Android. Lucene 4.8 will require Java 7, so it is unlikely that it will work on Android anymore. ",
