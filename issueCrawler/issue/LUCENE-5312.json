As far as the future, I am worried about the API \n\nI think we should decide if the central class should be DocComparator or Sorter and adjust our APIs appropriately: e.g. with the patch its not easy to just sort on a NDV field with block joins, but I feel like it should be.\n\nBut as a start, lets do this first and see if we can reorganize.
