    "description": "This is my first issue here, so excuse me if anything is wrong.\n\nWhen recovering a core backup according to the API, the process goes normally restoring all the files except the biggest (.fdt file). If you restart SoLR then that core is not loaded.\nSome other times I've found that the .fdt file is copied partially, so restarting has the same effect. The log says that the .fdt file is copied, but it's not.\n\nThe only workarounds found are:\n\n\tCopy the .fdt file manually from the backup\n\tDeleting the index completely before restoring\n\tOptimizing the index before restarting SoLR (weird with one file missing but worked).\n\n\n\nThanks,\nManuel F.",

            "content": "Some more workarounds/hints:\n\n\n\tApart from deleting the index before restoring, you also get a consistent restore if you just optimize the index previously.\n\tIf you have already restored, not restarted Solr yet, but you're missing the big fdt file, the best you can do is unload the core temporarily (the missing file shows up just when you do it). As I said before, if instead you happen to restart Solr, this core won't start.\n\tSometimes when restore doesn't work properly, JVM takes all the memory available\n\n\n ",
