We try to reserve the JIRA system for code issues rather than usage questions.\n\nPlease ask the question here: solr-user@lucene.apache.org, see: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc\n\nWhen you raise question on the user's list, include pertinent details, including sample data, queries and responses if possible, along with what you expect to see but don't.\n\nIf the consensus there is that there are code issues, we can reopen this JIRA or create a new one.\n\nThe start scripts are using options not supported in Java 10, see SOLR-12141: Fix \"bin/solr\" shell scripts (Windows/Linux/Mac) to correctly detect major Java version\n  and use numerical version comparison to enforce minimum requirements. Also remove obsolete \"UseParNewGC\" option.  This allows to start Solr with Java 10 or later. (Uwe Schindler) ",
