    "description": "Currently the queryElevation component will elevate specific documents matching the Id provided in input.\nThis is generally correct as we need to be sure the ID we boost is unique.\n\nThis can be potentially problematic when used with the field collapsing.\n\nSpecifically after we collapsed on fieldA, the collapsed results will have a unique value on fieldA.\n\nThis issue is to allow the flexibility, when necessary to elevate documents based on a different unique field instead of the primary key.\n\ne.g.\nIn the index we store products by different suppliers.\nEach document has:\n the unique Id : <id> \n the Id of the product : <productId>\n\nAfter collapsing on productId, productId will become unique and a good candidate for the queryElevation component.\n\n\n\n\tThis issue will implement an additional request parameter for the queryElevation component : idField\nThe code will then be changed to be parametric.\nI will take a look to the code, not sure if it is possible.\n\n\n\nUser responsibility will be to provide idField which make sense.",
