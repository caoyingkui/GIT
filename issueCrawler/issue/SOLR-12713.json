Then reload the collection with the Collections API to make the changes effective. ",

I'd be happy to review\n\nI think it might involve some plumbing though.\u00a0 We'd need to start with Solr allowing multiple data directories on startup.\u00a0\n\nThen Core level APIs like create core need to support taking a disk parameter\n\nAnd then Collection level APIs would need to be able to utilize it ( add-replica etc )\n\nWe could tackle these as sub-jiras to make it easier to review and commit smaller chunks.
