    "description": "For a full detail of the issue, please see the mailing list: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201011.mbox/%3CAANLkTimE8z8yOni+u0Nsbgct1=eF7E+sU0_WAKu2cMno@mail.gmail.com%3E\n\nThe nutshell version of the issue is that when I have a query that contains ranges on a specific (non-highlighted) field, the highlighter component is attempting to create a query that exceeds the value of maxBooleanClauses set from solrconfig.xml. This is despite my explicit setting of hl.field, hl.requireFieldMatch, and various other hightlight options in the query. \n\nAs suggested by Koji in the follow-up response, I removed the range queries from my main query, and SOLR and highlighting were happy to fulfill my request. It was suggested that if removing the range queries worked that this might potentially be a bug, hence my filing this JIRA ticket. For what it is worth, if I move my range queries into an fq, I do not get the exception about exceeding maxBooleanClauses, and I get the effect that I was looking for.",

            "content": "Currently, I do not think this is a problem of Solr. Because the code to create QueryScorer for Highlighting is quite simple\n\nQueryScorer scorer = new QueryScorer(query,\n       hl.requireFieldMatch == true ? fieldName : null);\n\n\nand\n\nif (reqFieldMatch) {\n  return new QueryTermScorer(query, request.getSearcher().getIndexReader(), fieldName);\n} else {\n  return new QueryTermScorer(query);\n}\n\n\n\nI think it is related to how Lucene rewrite the query, will try to dig deeper into Lucene code and figure out the changes.
