I compiled everything else under both 1.5 and 1.4 compatibility.\n\nI did find that two contrib files are duplicated. These are:\n./queries/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/similar/MoreLikeThis.java\n./similarity/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/similar/MoreLikeThis.java\n\n./queries/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/similar/SimilarityQueries.java\n./similarity/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/similar/SimilarityQueries.java\n\nThe first pair only differed by whitespace.\nThe second pair only by a comment and the style of imports.\n\nThere is a dependency on queries by xml-query-parser, but non on similarity.\nSo I'd suggest wacking similarity.
