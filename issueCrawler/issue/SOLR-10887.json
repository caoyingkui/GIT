Requires backcompat handling as mentioned in Yonik's comment:\n\n\nthere is back compat to consider. I'd also prefer that if it get changed, we first look for \"managed-schema.xml\", then \"managed-schema\", and then \"schema.xml\" to preserve back compat.",

This has been an annoyance of mine.\n\nAlexandre Rafalovitch had some fantastic comments on this in another issue that I will quote:\nOn xml extension for managed-schema. Not having an XML extension means that file is a special case everywhere. Admin UI had several JIRAs because that file would not display properly, file system sorting is confusing, presentations that try to explain things are confusing. Even just viewing the example schemas on filesystem is confusing as there is no data-type mapping and editors do not open it up without explicit intervention. ",
