    "description": "I've been spelunking in the SolrCore and CoreContainer code for Solr-4735, and came across this.  There's one unused constructor (with a misleading comment on it), and the javadoc for the other two constructors is incomplete, so here's a housekeeping patch tidying it up.\n\nI think the javadoc comments on the remaining constructors is also inaccurate, though? The SolrCore doesn't register itself or deal with name clashes any more, that's all done in the CoreContainer.",
