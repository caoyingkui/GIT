We only made them public.\n\nI get your point - you don't think we should commit to this API signature, but IMO we should \u2013 if MS is a valid extension point by applications, we must support this API, otherwise MS cannot be extended at all. Also, getNextMerge() jdoc specifies \"Expert: the MergeScheeduler calls this method ...\" - this kind of makes this API public long time ago, only it wasn't. ",

We can discuss the @expert tag on the list, outside this issue.\n\nI'll commit shortly. ",
