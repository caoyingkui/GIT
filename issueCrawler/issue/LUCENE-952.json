    "description": "Several nightly builds (at least #136, #143 and #144) have failed due\nto timeout at 45 minutes while running the TestGdataIndexer.testDestroy()\ntest case.\n\nI tracked it down to this line:\n\n      // wait active for the commit\n      while(this.indexer.writer != null){}\n\nIntermittently, that while loop will spin forever.  I can only get the\nfailure to happen on Linux: it doesn't happen on Mac OS X (haven't\ntried windows).  The nightly build runs on Solaris 10, so it also\nhappens there.\n\nIt turns out, this is due to the fact that \"writer\" is not declared as\n\"volatile\".  This is because one thread is closing the indexer, which\nsets writer to null, but another thread is running the while loop.\nIf this.indexer.writer was set to null before that while loop starts,\nthe test will run through fine; else, it won't.\n\nI plan to fix this by adding this method to GDataIndexer class:\n\n    // Used only for testing\n    protected synchronized IndexWriter getWriter() \n{\n      return this.writer;\n    }\n\nand changing unit test to call that method.",
