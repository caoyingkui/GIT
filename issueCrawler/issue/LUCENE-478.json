            "content": "There are six classes of issues:\n\n1. A character range in StandardTokenizer.jj that is missing in\nJohn's list, and should be left as-is in StandardTokenizer.jj\n(in the <CJ> section):\n\n   1.a. [ U+3100 - U+312F ]\n        BoPoMoFo (a.k.a. ZhuYin): Phonetic transcription symbols\n        used in Taiwan; not used on mainland China.\n\n2. A character range in StandardTokenizer.jj that is also in\nJohn's list, but in the <LETTER> section rather than in the <CJ>\nsection, and should be left as-is:\n\n   2.a. [ U+1100 - U+11FF ]\n        Korean Jamo (phonetic symbols)\n\n3. A character range in StandardTokenizer.jj that is not present in\nJohn's list, and that should be removed from the <KOREAN> section\nin StandardTokenizer.jj:\n\n   3.a. [ U+D7A4 - U+D7AF ]\n        Non-character range at the end of the pre-composed Hangul \n        (Korean) block\n\n4. A character range in John's list that is missing in\nStandardTokenizer.jj, but which was not present in Unicode 3.0, and\nso strictly should not be included when running on Java 1.4; since\nthis is a non-character range in Unicode 3.0, however, I think it\nshould be included in StandardTokenizer.jj (in the <CJ> section)\nfor future compatibility with Java 1.5 and Unicode 4.0:\n\n   4.a. [ U+31F0 - U+31FF ]\n        Japanese Katakana phonetic extensions; these were introduced\n        in Unicode version 3.2 (see\n        http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr28/tr28-3.html#10_3_katakana )\n\n5. Character ranges in John's list that are missing in\nStandardTokenizer.jj, and that should be added to the newly\nre-labeled <CJ> section:\n\n   5.a. [ U+FF65 - U+FF9F ]\n        Half-width Japanese Katakana (phonetic symbols)\n\n   5.b. [ U+3d2e - U+4DB5 ] (non-chars [ U+4DB6 - U+4DBF ] excluded)\n        CJK Ideograph Extension A.  \n        This range was introduced in Unicode 3.0.\n\n6. A character range in John's list that is missing in\nStandardTokenizer.jj, and that should be added to the <LETTER>\nsection, since it, like the [ U+1100 - U+11FF ] range already\nincluded there, is a range of Korean Jamo (phonetic symbols):\n\n   6.a. [ U+FFA0 - U+FFDC ]\n        Half-width Korean Jamo (phonetic symbols) ",
