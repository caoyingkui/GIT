            "content": "I am quite sure this is a newline issue, but it would really be good to get the changes.\n\nThe reason for this problem might be different handling of GIT with newlines. zkCli is a windows-only file, so in SVN it is marked as eol-style:CRLF, the opposite zKcli.sh is marked as eol-style:LF. Default source files without platform dependentness are marked as eol-style:native. I think GIT cannot handle that. "
