    "description": "We have a custom implementation of ExtendedDismaxQParserPlugin, bundled into a jar in the multicore lib.\nThe custom ExtendedDismaxQParserPlugin implementation still uses org.apache.solr.search.QueryUtils makeQueryable method, same as the old implementation.\n\nHowever, the method calls throws an java.lang.IllegalAccessError, as it is being called from the inner ExtendedSolrQueryParser class and the makeQueryable has no access modifier (basically default).\n\nCan we have the access modifier to public, as all the methods are static, to be accessible",
