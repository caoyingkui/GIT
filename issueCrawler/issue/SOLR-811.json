    "description": "currently DIH constructs the query for delta-import by mixing the query and pk and delta row ids\n\nThis leads to creation of wrong queries if SqlEntityProcessor cannot parse the query properly. \n\nsolution add a new attribute 'deltaImportQuery' attribute which can use dataimporter.delta.<pkfield-name> in the template and construct a full query \n\nIf this is absent it will continue to work the old way",
