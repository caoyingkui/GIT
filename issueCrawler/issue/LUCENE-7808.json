As for rewrite() - I'm not sure what is needed there exactly.   For some reason I added a .rewrite to SpanPayloadCheckQuery, but not to PayloadScoreQuery - but I guess I didn't do that fully?   Do you have an example or some other hints as to how to implement what is needed?  Happy to do the work while I'm in there! ",
