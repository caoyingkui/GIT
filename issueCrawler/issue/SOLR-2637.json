            "content": "Thanks Tao. I looked at the patch and it looks good.\nThey are three things that caught my attention:\n\n\tThe classes Grouped and GroupField now extend from ArrayList. I think it is more consistent with other classes (like FacetField, PivotField) if these classes have a List as a field.\n\tMore meaningful names for Grouped and GroupField classes. Maybe rename Grouped to GroupResponse and maybe rename GroupField to GroupCommand, since it might be grouped by function or query.\n\tAnd as Ryan said some tests would be great.\n\n\n\nFor the rest great work!

That have a list as field.\n\tRenamed Grouped to GroupResponse\n\tRenamed GroupField to GroupCommand\n\tAdded an initial test.\n\tFixed bug in XMLResponseParser. When a lst element appeared inside a arr element, the check at line 320 failed. This resulted in an exception.\n\tMade the code work with group.query\n\n\n\nThis is work in progress. I'll need to extend the test with more assertions. Also I might make GroupCommand abstract and add three concrete subclasses (GroupField, GroupFunction and GroupQuery). Seems like a good idea to me.

The previous version set the maxScore based on the top n groups (inside a command), which in only one case can be correct (if sorting is score desc. As the comment specified in QueryResponse). If users still want this they can get the maxScore from the first score.\n\n\n\nI think this ready to be committed. "
