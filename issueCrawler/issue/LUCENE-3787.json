    "description": "Spinoff from LUCENE-2632, since it took us a fair amount of time to track down,\nI think its worth trying to improve the API.\n\nThe DocValuesConsumer api's default merge implementation calls canMerge/getDocValuesForMerge/getDocValuesType (protected methods).\n\nbut its a little strange how this works:\n\n\tall norms implementations must override the default DV implementation, or they might accidentally merge docvalues into their norms!\n\tpreflex-RW only overrides 2 of these... how is its norms merging working... is it?\n\tits tricky obviously for issues like LUCENE-2632: as delegating merge() is not very obvious either.\n\n\n\nSo I think we should look at this, instead of having all NormsWriters override DocValues, redefining these methods in a way thats \nnot a \"is-a\" relationship, we could do something else like have split NormsConsumer/DVConsumer apis that share a package-private base class.\n\nThis way a norms impl just extends NormsConsumer and there are no traps.",
