That's sounds reasonable, except the forceReplication flag there, if forceReplication == false ( which is the default for the first run ), we won't clear slave's index. \nTherefore Tlog replica index is not empty meanwhile master index is empty \n==> Inconsistent between Tlog replica and it's master.\n\nBut I think we can let Solr 7.0 continue without respin, because\n\n\tFirstly, for data loss event happen, the master's index must be emptied and the IndexFetcher failed to fetch the index from master in the first try. This kinda very rare ( I think ).\n\tSecondly, for inconsistent event happen ( no data get lost in this case ), the master's must be emptied and the replica's index is not empty. Furthermore the inconsistent state will gone when master do the next commit.\n\n\n\nI think both cases are very rare to happen in production, so we can let Solr 7.0 voting continue if we are not confident with the patch.
