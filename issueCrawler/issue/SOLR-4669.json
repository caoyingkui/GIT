    "description": "Unless i'm smoking crack, some behavior i noticed working on SOLR-4629 indicates that when solr replication detects both a changed index, and changed config files, the index is copied over and put into use by the current solr core, then the conig files are copied over, and then the solr core is reloaded with the modified configs.\n\nwhich means there is a window of time in which the \"new\" index is being searched using the old configs \u2013 which could have bizare consequences.",

            "content": "I wonder if this is a big deal in practice. As far as I can see, it just means the old configs search for a window with old index, the new configs search for a window on the new index (generally, simply the old index + a bit more data). Then you get a window of new configs, new index.\n\nI'm not sure it's a bad tradeoff vs always creating a fully new index folder and downloading all files (I suppose you could optimize to a local copy operation though).\n\nI think that would be the likely fix though. Simply force a new index dir on this condition - you have to do a core reload regardless. "
