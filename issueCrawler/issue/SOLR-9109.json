    "description": "Currently solr/lucene/common-build.xml hardcodes file ivy-settings.xml in the ivy.configure task. It means that, unlike all other CDH components that use Ant, Solr does not allow the user to provide a custom ivysettings.xml.\n\nIn the Cauldron CDH build, we need to make some adjustments in the build process to satisfy CDH-internal build dependencies with artifacts generated locally, rather than download them from repo1.maven.org etc. E.g. all component should use locally-generated avro-snapshot jars instead of publicly released ones, etc. For Ant, we achieve that by giving it a special ivysettings.xml file, that limits artifact downloading to the local on-disk maven repository and Cloudera artifactory server.\n\nAll CDH components except Solr allow the user to specify a custom ivysettings.xml file by overriding -Divysettings.xml property. We need to add the same feature to Solr. It can be easily achieved by changing several lines in solr/lucene/common-build.xml.",

Currently we have to patch Solr in order to build it, which is not ideal.  If we had a custom extra file, that would be fine, but patching an existing Solr file doesn't feel right. ",

Perhaps an experiment demonstrating that after the change the properties propagate somewhere they are not supposed to be visible?\n\nAs for including ivy-versions.properties in the new user-supplied ivysettings.xml. The whole point of making my change is to make all CDH components use the same single ivysettings.xml file, that just defines several supported locations to download artifacts from. Adding Solr-specific stuff to it may cause problems for other components. We can, in the worst case, play some tricks. Like, create at run time a customized copy of our ivysettings.xml with ivy-versions.properties \"injected\" into it. But this is obviously not pretty.

There is another one using the ivy-versions.properties, where it includes a prefix: See lucene/analyzers/common/build.xml for getting icu4j version:\n\n\n  <target xmlns:ivy=\"antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant\" name=\"-resolve-icu4j\" unless=\"icu4j.resolved\" depends=\"ivy-availability-check,ivy-configure\">\n    <loadproperties prefix=\"ivyversions\" srcFile=\"${common.dir}/ivy-versions.properties\"/>\n    <ivy:cachepath organisation=\"com.ibm.icu\" module=\"icu4j\" revision=\"${ivyversions./com.ibm.icu/icu4j}\"\n      inline=\"true\" conf=\"default\" transitive=\"true\" pathid=\"icu4j.classpath\"/>\n    <property name=\"icu4j.resolved\" value=\"true\"/>\n  </target>\n\n\n\nCan we change the forbiddenapis one to work in a similar way?
