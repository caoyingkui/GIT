    "description": "Given text of: \"x y z x z x a\"\nWith a query of: spanNear([spanNear([text:x, text:y, text:z], 0, true), text:a], 10, false)\nResulting highlight: <B>x</B> <B>y</B> <B>z</B> <B>x</B> <B>z</B> <B>x</B> <B>a</B>\nExpected highlight: <B>x</B> <B>y</B> <B>z</B> x z x <B>a</B>\n\nThis is caused because WeightedSpanTermExtractor.extractWeightedSpanTerms takes the SpanQuery and flattens all terms and uses the positions from the outermost SpanNear clause (ignoring the nested SpanNear positions). I believe this could be resolved with a little recursion - walking the span query tree in the extractWeightedSpanTerms method.",
