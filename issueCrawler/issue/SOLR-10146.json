So you can delete all the replicas inside a shard, but you cannot delete the whole shard, i.e. call the DELETESHARD Collection API.\n\nAdd a button for this. This is useful for cleaning up e.g. after calling SPLITSHARD.",

This keeps UI cleaner since there is no point in trying an action that will never succeed.\n\tAdded CHANGES entry\n\n\n\nI'll commit this next week if everybody happy clappy\n\nPS: In order to test, I created three collections, one plain, one where I split a shard to get an inactive one, and a third with implicit routing. Only the implicit shards and the inactive were showing the button. ",
