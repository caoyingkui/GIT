    "description": "In various places we catch Throwable and suppress it, usually in exception handlers where we want to just throw the first exc we had hit.\n\nBut this is dangerous for a thread interrupt since it means we can swallow & ignore the interrupt.\n\nWe should at least catch the interrupt & restore the interrupt bit, if we can't rethrow it.\n\nOne example is in SegmentInfos where we write the segments.gen file... there are many other examples in SegmentInfos too.",

I integrated another utility into IOUtils that checks if we suppress an InterruptException and resets the interrupt bit on the thread if so.
