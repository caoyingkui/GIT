            "content": "Here is a patch. Most of it is about simply replacing FilteredQuery with BooleanQuery. However, I had to slightly change the Filter class so that it can choose whether it should be applied eagerly (through the iterator) or lazily (through the bits) when consumed through the Query API. This was useful to keep the lucene/facets and lucene/spatial modules working since they build filters that should always be consumed after the query. "
