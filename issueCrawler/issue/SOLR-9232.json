If you are, then it would be correct for it to not work, but you should get an error message instead of what's happening now.\n\nIf you're not in cloud mode, then this is a bigger problem.  Note that you should be able to use the CoreAdmin API directly (in non-cloud mode) to accomplish the swap.  I would like to know whether this works, or if it's just the admin UI.\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/CoreAdmin+API ",
