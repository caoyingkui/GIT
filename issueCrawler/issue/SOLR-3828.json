            "content": "Looking back at SOLR-2977 and r1222234 where these lines of code were added, i think it was just a brain fart on grant's part \u2013 he introduced a code branch in a place where (previously) BooleanClauses were always added with MUST_NOT and now that he didn't wnat to actaully exclude them, just mark them, he cloned that code and had it use SHOULD instead.\n\nbut i agree, that doesn't make any sense \u2013 the set of results using markExclude=true should be the same as the set of results you get not using the elevation component at all, and the scores of the excluded docs shouldn't change.\n\nCommitted revision 1384567.\nCommitted revision 1384577. - 4x\n\nThanks for finding this and providing the test alexey!\n\n "
