    "description": "SOLR-5265 added these asserts to check equality of SolrDocument, SolrInputDocument and SolrInputField instead of adding a compare method to any of these classes.\n\nBut these are actually compare methods. So we should rename them to compareSolrDocument() etc. and in TestJavaBinCodec fix the usage. Currently in TestJavaBinCodec the backcompat test is broken.",
