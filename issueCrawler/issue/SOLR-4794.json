    "description": "I've tried three browsers for my Android phone, an Amaze 4G by HTC.  All of them have problems.\n\nOne problem common to all of them is that the stuff on the left-hand side of the screen always stays put and will cover up the rest of the page if you zoom in and/or scroll around.\n\n1) Built-in browser: I think this is probably provided or modified by HTC.  This one is extremely broken. By clicking in what looks like incorrect places, you can select a core, but you can't get to any of the good stuff like the query or analysis UI.\n\n2) Chrome for Android: Better than the HTC/Android browser.  I can get to the query UI, but when I try to execute a query, it goes back to the dashboard.\n\n3) Firefox for Android: Works fairly well on the few things I tested, except for the left-hand stuff covering the rest of the page as mentioned above.  I don't know if everything is working, but this is the only one that let me use the query UI.",

I made the VPN connection on my phone and tried to run a quick query:\n\n\n*:* -field:[* TO *]\n\n\nI already had two browsers on my phone, they didn't work.  After I arrived in the office, I tried Firefox. "

This way default position of static would work fine.\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp\n\nWith this change android version on Samsung S4 default and chrome browsers work without overlap on scroll or during zoom.\n\nHowever content is appearing below the left menu i.e y position is non zero. \nSome more changes would be needed at CSS to make sure content window is positioned with y position as zero. May be CSS experts would be able to make rest of the adjustments needed for y to be zero. "
