    "description": "It would be useful to me if I could have Solr automatically cut off autowarming after a certain amount of time has passed, instead of configuring a percentage or an explicit count.  This would allow for maximizing performance in an environment that has scheduled maintenance scripts that do regular updates.  If your update script runs every two minutes, you could ensure that all warming is done within 60 seconds.\n\nI don't know whether the caches are currently warmed serially or in parallel, but warming them in parallel would allow the alternate or additional option of a \"global\" autowarm timeout.",
