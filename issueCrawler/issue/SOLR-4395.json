    "description": "In following scenario:\n\n\n\tCluster compose by 2 nodes, node A and node B.\n\tTwo collection:\n\n\n\tCollection 1 with the leader in a A and the replica in B and\n\tCollection 2 with the leader in B and the replica in A.\n\n\n\nIf a node A goes down, then the replica of collection 2 located in node A will be promote to leader to respect the failover. \n\nIf the node A comes back online again, we have the scenario where all leader are in the same node. This maybe can be have performance issues in indexing throughput.\n\nI think that can be desirable have a mechanism to promote one replica to leader and recover the initial layout to leverage the physical machines, I/O CPU and so on.",
