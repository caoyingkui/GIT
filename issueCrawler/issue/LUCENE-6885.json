The intention was to avoid allocation of the segmentReaders when they will remain empty because oldReaders is null and to allocate as many elements as will be needed (usually that would be more than the default 10 initial elements).\n\nWould it be clearer to do\n\nfinal Map<String,Integer> segmentReaders = (oldReaders == null ? null : new HashMap<>(oldReaders.size()));\n\n\ni.e. no lazy initialisation as such but the segmentReaders == null check later on would remain?
