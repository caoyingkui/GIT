    "description": "When selecting a core in the section \"Core Admin\" in the Solr Admin web UI, data like dataDir, version, numDocs, maxDoc are updated via JavaScript, but lastModified is not. A refresh of the page does the trick.\n\nHad a look into the network traffic of my browser and it seems that the JSON fetched via AJAX contains the correct information.\n\nCan be reproduced in different browsers with the example by cloning collection1 into a collection2 and indexing collection2 anew by calling \"java -jar post.jar *.xml\" in the exampledocs directory.\n\nTested with Solr 4.4.0.",
