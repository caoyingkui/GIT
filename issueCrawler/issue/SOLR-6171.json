Here's an updated patch.\n\nOne question - at the moment, we wait until all the cores are loaded before registering them as up in ZK.  Is there a specific reason for doing this?  It adds a bit of complexity to the code, and it would be good to at least add a comment explaining why it's necessary. "

It reduces the probability that a core is registered in ZK before it is able to serve HTTP requests.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-5552?focusedCommentId=13855254&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13855254 "

            "content": "Ah right, because the HTTP connector won't start accepting connections until CoreContainer.load() has returned, and we wait for all cores to startup before returning.\n\nIt would be nice to return immediately and let the cores load in the background, registering themselves as they appear - that way the first cores to load aren't waiting on later ones.  But that's probably a matter for another issue. "
