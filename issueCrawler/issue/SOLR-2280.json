    "description": "The commitWithin option on an UpdateRequest is only honored for requests containing new documents.  It does not, for example, work with a delete query.  The following doesn't work as expected:\n\nUpdateRequest request = new UpdateRequest();\nrequest.deleteById(\"id123\");\nrequest.setCommitWithin(1000);\nsolrServer.request(request);\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, the commitWithin attribute should be  permitted on the <delete/> xml tag as well as <add/>.  Such a change would go in XMLLoader.java and its would have some ramifications elsewhere too.  Once this is done, then UpdateRequest.getXml() can be updated to generate the right XML.",

The patch is for the 3x branch.\n\nTwo things should be noted:\n\n\tThe commit is fired even if the delete doesn't really delete any document.\n\tWhen using the BinaryUpdateRequestHandler the params of the UpdateRequest are loaded when parsing the docs. If the request doesn't include a docs list, then the params aren't loaded. I added a workaround for this, but SOLR-1164 should solve this problem definitely.\n\n "
