    "description": "Firstly I love the new UI pages ( ZK Status and Nodes ) . Thanks Jan H\u00f8ydahl for all the great work!\n\nI setup a 3 node ZK ensemble to play around with the UI and attaching the screenshot for reference.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere are a few suggestions I had\n\n\tLet\u2019s show Approximate Size in human readable form.\u00a0 We can use RamUsageEstimator#humanReadableUnits to calculate it\n\tShow warning symbol when Ensemble is standalone\n\tIf maxSessionTimeout < Solr's ZK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT then ZK will only honor up-to the maxSessionTimeout value for the Solr->ZK connection. We could\u00a0mark that as a warning.\n\tIf maxClientCnxns < live_nodes show this as a red? Each solr node connects to all zk nodes so if the number of nodes in the cluster is high one should\u00a0also be increasing maxClientCnxns",

I don't know if you played around with the other warnings, but you can test e.g. by specifying only two of the zk's in -z when starting Solr - you will then see complaints about quorum size, mismatches etc. Guess you\u00a0could extend those checks to also look at other values as you suggest.

            "content": "The patch looks good. A bit hard to test the various error conditions if we don't mock the response data.\u00a0Few comments:\n\n\tIf you get into zk_max_latency issues, the same error may be added once for each ZK if all are busy. Perhaps it helps to include the host name in the message to distinguish?\n\tThe \"ok\" key for each zkhost is \"true\" if RUOK returns IMOK.\u00a0Should we flip that to false if we detect issues with that host?\n\tNot high prio, but code-wise it would perhaps be cleaner to separate information fetch phase (monitorZookeeper) from the inspection and detection of errors. I.e. keep\u00a0monitorZookeeper as-is and add a new method detectIssues(zkStatus, errors) where all\u00a0analysis, both existing and the new per-host analysis is done? This is less important though.\n\n ",

            "content": "Additional feature request would be if you could say do a click for a 'cons' command which will show latencies and packets rcvd/sent on all connections. This can be useful when determining if that max latency is an outlier or a significant problem or packet communication on a connection. You could also do ones for 'crst' (Connection reset of stats), 'srst' (Server reset of stats). Possibly might\u00a0add 'dump' for connection ids and attached ephemeral nodes, but perhaps getting farther out there. I think the most important one here might just be 'cons' ",
