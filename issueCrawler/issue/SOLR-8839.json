    "description": "In the /segments portion of the admin site, the segments are displayed as a bar graph with the size of each bar proportional to the logarithm of the segment size.\nWithin each bar the number of deleted documents is shown as a dark-gray portion at the end.\nBefore the angular version, the size of this part was directly proportional to the number of deleted documents with respect to the total number of documents in the segment\nIn the angular version, the dark-gray portion is way too large.\n\nIn the previous version, the result was odd as well since it displayed a proportional percentage within in a logarithmic graph.\n\nI'll add a PR shortly that changes the calculation so the dark-gray part looks approximately proportional to the size the segment would shrink if optimized.",
