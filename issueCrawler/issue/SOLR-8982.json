In what way is it useful to you?\n\nThe reason we added them in the first place was to get as much information as possible (from one place) when a user might have problems with his cloud-setup. i can't say if it did get use often, never used the cloud functionality that extensive on my own.

How many times int he 4x world do you remember something like \"send me your cluster state\".\n\nFor troubleshooting your own installation, we can look at the clusterstate right in the UI.\n\nI guess what I'm saying here is that as far as I'm concerned, it's not important to bring it back. No real strong feelings on that mind you... ",

It would just work too.\n\nI can make a patch of either option. ",
