    "description": "This ticket will add the cluster Streaming Expression to hook into the carrot2 clustering handler. Real-time clustering will fit nicely into the Streaming Expression library and should benefit from being able interact with other streams. \n\nOne interesting approach to clustering would be to seed the cluster expression with a stream.\n\nFor example:\n\n\ncluster(collection, expr, walk=\"field->field\")\n\n\n\nThe walk parameter would map a field from the underlying stream to another field to perform the clustering search.\n\nSo this could work:\n\ncluster(collection, facet(collection..),  walk=\"author->author\", rows=1000)\n\n\n\nThis would run a facet expression for authors and the form a query with the author facets on the author field, bringing back all the content that the author set has written, and then cluster these documents.\n\nThis would give a topic map for a specific set of authors.",
