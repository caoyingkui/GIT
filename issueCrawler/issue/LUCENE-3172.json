    "description": "lucene-misc contrib module has two package names equals to the core version: org.apache.lucene.index and org.apache.lucene.store. For theese modules we need to configure the creation of the bundles so that the OSGI repository recognize theese packages as merged else we get a 'uses constraint violation' error in the installation.\n\nThe solution is to mark the packages as mergeables adding a configuration in the maven-bunde-plugin:\n\n        <configuration>\n          <instructions>\n                <Export-Package>*;-split-package:=merge-first</Export-Package>\n          </instructions>\n        </configuration>\n\nthe * represents the package names. We could put org.apache.lucene.* too",

            "content": "FYI, I usually also create an \"umbrella\" bundle which has a Require-Bundle dependency on all the Lucene bundles with such split-package headers. It does not contain any class files but just re-exports the \"merged\" packages without a split-package header. This allows client bundles to do a vanilla Import-Package. Otherwise, any downstream client will be forced to add the special split-package info to their Import-Package declaration. ",
