Okay, sure maybe we should have an option to require \"strict\" JSON, but it should default to \"false\".\n\nCould we support unquoted simple \"name\" values as well? Like:\n\n\n{id: my-key}\n\n\n And if people strenuously object, maybe we just need to have a \"Solr JSON\" (SJSON or SON - Solr Object Notation) format with the relaxed rules. "

We don't have to be the guardian angels of 'json standard'\n\nThe latest version of noggit (v0.6) already supports single quoted and unquoted strings.\n\nYes, I saw the code.

            "content": "Hi,\nsorry I was not arguing against this change! I just wanted to mention that \"JSON\" has a spec. I strongly agree that \"keys\" should be free to use no quotes at all, because that is what you know from ECMA Script. ECMA Script also allows single quotes. If we allow that, of course single quotes must be escaped in input data.\n\nInterestingly at the same time when Noble Paul's issue was opened, in my mailbox the announcement for PHP 5.6 went in. Interestingly they do the opposite: Their parser json_decode was more flexible before, now its hardened to be more strict: http://php.net/releases/5_6_0.php (I don't know how many apps will break).\n\nIn any case, we may accept more relax JSON - I have no problem with that, but when delivering JSON in the ResponseWriter we should be 100% according to spec (this includes also escaping forward slashes). Because the client may be a browser, and browsers only accept 100% valid JSON for security reasons if you parse with the official JSON API in newer browsers (if you use unsafe JSONP or eval() to parse, you should be killed).

            "content": "Could we support unquoted simple \"name\" values as well?\n\nI disagree. The proposal in this issue was to allow all \"Javascript\" syntax. But Javascript does not allow values to be without quotes. The reason is simple: You cannot guess the type from it (at least the javascript grammar cannot).\n\nOne thing: We should (if relaxing) also allow trailing commas, like:\n\n\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value\",\n  \"key2\": \"value\", // <-- here\n}\n\n "
