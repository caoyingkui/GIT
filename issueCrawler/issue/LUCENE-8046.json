    "description": "Our static code analysis tool has scanned the codebase of Lucene 7.0.1, and find  29 cases, that developers reassigned values to a variable continuously. \n\nFor example, the following code from file: \nanalysis/common/src/java/org/tartarus/snowball/ext/CatalanStemmer.java\n\n\ncursor=limit - v_5;\ncursor=limit_backward;\n\n\n\nIn the above code snippet, the second statement makes the first one redundant and useless.\nThere are 29 cases in total in the codebase of Lucene.",
