    "description": "When making a SOLR search call with facets turned on, I notice that the facets JSON string is not properly formatted using wt=json. \n\nI would expect that there would be a bracketed array around each record rather than running them all together.  This is very hard to read with ExtJS as its JsonReader reads each element as its own record when the paired records are meant to be together.\n\nHere's an example of the output I get:\n\n\n\"facet_counts\":{\n \"facet_queries\":{},\n \"facet_fields\":{\n    \"deviceName\":[\n     \"x2\",6,\n     \"dd22\",12,\n     \"f12\",1],\n    \"devicePrgMgr\":[\n     \"alberto\",80,\n     \"anando\",24,\n     \"artus\",101],\n    \"portfolioName\":[\n     \"zztop\",32],\n    \"chipsetName\":[\n     \"fat\",3,\n     \"thin\",2],\n\n\n\nAs an example, I would expect chipset family to be so that the JsonReader can read each as record:\n\n    \"chipsetName\":[\n        [\"fat\",3],\n        [\"thin\",2]\n     ],\n\n\n\nSee here for details on Json Arrays.",
