If someone familiar with that new code knows the quick/easy way to have a... i guess a FieldProducer impl for the SegmentReader that can expose position information, that'd be great.\nI would imagine that for a single segment we're still very capable of knowing the position of term.\n\nI have code that depends on this functionality, i would like to be able to try it all out against lucene/trunk as it moves forward.
