EarlyTerminatingSortingCollector now also takes the merge policy as an argument to check if the sort order is a prefix of the index-time order and then early-terminates on every segment where the serialized index order matches the sort order that is wrapped by the merge policy.

            "content": "I am +1 to the patch, but not excited about permanently requiring the user to pass a MergePolicy to this collector.\n\nOne reason is that it makes it harder to integrate with other search code. E.G. somewhere i made a patch to allow inexact results/hit counts as flags to indexsearcher, which would make this collector much easier to use (and also allow other tricks). \n\nBut this means somehow we have to serialize the \"sort\" better, which is complicated. So +1 to the patch for now  "
