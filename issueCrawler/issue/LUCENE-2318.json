It will create indexes in the current directory where the tests run from, which is different if I run \"ant test\" from <root>, <root>/contrib and <root>/benchmark ...\n\nOr, we can tweak common-build.xml to fallback to <root>/test. In fact, looking in common-build.xml, I already see tempDir defaults to \n{build.dir}\n/test. Look at lines 448 (where it is set), 417 where it is used and 418 where java.io.tmpdir is set to that value.\n\nMaybe we need to change the definition of build.dir from location=\"build\" to location=\"\n{common.dir}\n/build\" so that it always references <root>/build.\n\nAnd if run from eclipse, default TEMP_DIR constant to \"java.io.tmpdir\"?

If you run the tests from ANT there is never a problem, they use ${build.dir}/test, which is perfectly defined. But the tempDir system property is not set when running the tests from eclipse. So Your suggestion to fallback to java.io.tmpdir is a good idea, maybe with \"/lucene-test\" appended.\n\nMaybe we need to change the definition of build.dir from location=\"build\" to location=\"{common.dir}/build\" so that it always references <root>/build.\n\nThis would break contrib. Its defined correctly at the moment, as ANT guarantees that \".\" or the current dir defaults to the `dirname build.xml`.\n\nOr, we can tweak common-build.xml to fallback to <root>/test.\n\ncommon-build never needs a fallback, as its always defined. and <root>/test is exactly what we do not want to have as it will not be cleaned up on \"ant clean\" ",

Only remaining are the special properties in benchmark (maybe that can be solved, too) and System.getProperty(\"line.separator\") - but that's fine.\n\nLuceneTestCaseJ4 now has two fields of type java.io.File:\n\n\tTEMP_DIR that is retrieved from system property \"tempDir\", set by ANT or, if not available from \"java.io.tmpdir\". By this tests will also run correctly from eclipse. This is static.\n\tDATA_DIR (deprecated) that is used by some contrib tests. This should not be used, instead the tests should use this.getClass().getResource/getResourceAsStream, which is also relative to the current tests. I did not change the tests to use this. DATA_DIR is detected from system property (set by ANT), else it is loaded from classpath of the current test class, because of that it is not static (but final) and initialized in the class ctor.\n\n ",

Other tests that really need a File instance can use LuceneTestCase(J4).getDataFile(String), which was heavily borrowed from the PorterTestCase, I moved the code there. Its only few tests that use this function.\n\nThis is now ready to commit. ",
