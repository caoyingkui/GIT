    "description": "TwoDoublesStrategy supports finding Documents that are within a Circle, yet it is impossible to provide one due to the following code found at the start of TwoDoublesStrategy.makeQuery():\n\n\nShape shape = args.getShape();\n    if (!(shape instanceof Rectangle)) {\n      throw new InvalidShapeException(\"A rectangle is the only supported shape (so far), not \"+shape.getClass());//TODO\n    }\n    Rectangle bbox = (Rectangle) shape;\n\n\n\nI think instead the code which handles Circles should ask for the bounding box of the Shape and uses that instead.",
