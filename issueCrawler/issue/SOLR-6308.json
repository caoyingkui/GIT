    "description": "I would like to add a parameter to the Query Elevation Component. Something like showFiltered=false where any results that have been filtered from the result set with the fq parameter will no longer be elevated.\n\nas an example if I had two documents returned in a query\n\n\nid=\"A\"\nfield_1=\"foo\"\n\nid=\"B\"\nfield_1=\"bar\"\n\n\n\nI would want the following query to yield the shown results\n\n\n/solr/elevate?q=*&fq=field_1:bar&elevate=true&elevateIds=A\n\nid=\"B\"\nfield_1=\"bar\"\n\n\n\nid A is removed from the results because it is not contained in the filtered results even though it is elevated. It would be nice if we could pass an optional parameter like showFiltered=false where any results that have been filtered from the result set with the fq parameter will no longer be elevated.",
