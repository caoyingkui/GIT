    "description": "This updates 2 places in the JSON Facets code that uses the advance()/docID() pattern instead of the simpler advanceExact().\u00a0 Most\u00a0other usages in the faceting code already make use of advanceExact().\n\nThe only remaining usage of advance() in\u00a0org.apache.solr.search.facet is in:\n\n\tUniqueAgg.BaseNumericAcc.collect\n\tHLLAgg..BaseNumericAcc.collect\n\n\n\nThe code for those of those looks very similar and probably makes sense to update but it would require changing the return type of the protected\u00a0docIdSetIterator() method to return a\u00a0DocValuesIterator in order to be able to call the advanceExact() method.",
