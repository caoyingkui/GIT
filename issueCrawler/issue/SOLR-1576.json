Would it make sense to supply an HTTP header with information about the error?  I was thinking something like:\n\n\nX-SOLR-ERROR-MESSAGE: unknown field 'fooBarBaz'\n\n\nThis would snap right into SolrDispatchFilter in sendError at line 363:\n\n\nres.addHeader(\"X-SOLR-ERROR-MESSAGE\",ex.getMessage());",
