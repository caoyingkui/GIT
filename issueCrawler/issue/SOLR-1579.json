    "description": "The fix to SOLR-1008 was wrong.  It used chardata escaping for a value that is an attribute value.\n\nI.e. instead of XML.escapeCharData it should call XML.escapeAttributeValue.\n\nOtherwise, any query used as a key in the filter cache whose printed representation contains a double-quote character causes invalid XML to be generated.",
