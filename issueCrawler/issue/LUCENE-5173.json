(see solr users list:Split Shard Error - maxValue must be non-negative).",

I like that the checkindex allows older segments with empty size, but once a segment was merged it can no longer be empty.\n\nMaybe the assert in SegmentMerge should be a hard check, unless SegmentMerger always strictly throws away empty segments (not that somebody can somehow with a crazy alcoholic mergepolicy create those segments again).

            "content": "I agree with both. My complaint was the following:\nThe assert was not correct, as asserts should only be used for real assertions withing the same class. For this special check, there is something outside of SegmentMerger that could maybe insert empty readers into the merge queue, so those should be thrown away while merging or when sergmentmerger initializes (so move to ctor is a good idea). I am thinking about crazy stuff like a merge policy that wraps with a FilterAtomicReader to filter while merging (like IndexSorter) - which is possible with the current API.\n\nSo the segments should be removed on creating the SegmentMerger when all readers to merge are already in the List<AtomicReader>.\n\nIn the IndexWriter#addIndexes we may then just need the top-level check to not even start a merge.
