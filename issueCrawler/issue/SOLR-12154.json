Developers must instead use slf4j APIs. I don't believe that's changing now with log4j2, or does it?\nWe need to address this before 7.4 to make sure we don't break anything by using Log4j2 directly\u00a0\n\nAfter SOLR-7887 the following classes explicitly import the org.apache.logging.log4j.** package so let's validate it's usage\n\n-\u00a0Log4j2Watcher\n\n-\u00a0SolrLogLayout\n\n-\u00a0StartupLoggingUtils\n\n-\u00a0RequestLoggingTest\n\n-\u00a0LoggingHandlerTest\n\n-\u00a0SolrTestCaseJ4\n\n-\u00a0TestLogLevelAnnotations\n\n-\u00a0LogLevel",

We could use strings instead of the object . I remember it was like that before SOLR-7887 but at some point I wanted to simply the type casts that were happening so i changed it to org.apache.logging.log4j.Level\u00a0. We could revert the change or think of a better approach.\n\nI won't be looking into this for the next 2 days most likely ",
