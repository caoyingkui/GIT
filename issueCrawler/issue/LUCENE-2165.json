    "description": "As discussed on the java-user list, the SnowballAnalyzer has been updated to use a Set of stop words. However, there is no constructor which accepts a Set, there's only the original String[] one\n\nThis is an issue, because most of the common sources of stop words (eg StopAnalyzer) have deprecated their String[] stop word lists, and moved over to Sets (eg StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET). So, for now, you either have to use a deprecated field on StopAnalyzer, or manually turn the Set into an array so you can pass it to the SnowballAnalyzer\n\nI would suggest that a constructor is added to SnowballAnalyzer which accepts a Set. Not sure if the old String[] one should be deprecated or not.\n\nA sample patch against 2.9.1 to add the constructor is:\n\n\n\u2014 SnowballAnalyzer.java.orig  2009-12-15 11:14:08.000000000 +0000\n+++ SnowballAnalyzer.java       2009-12-14 12:58:37.000000000 +0000\n@@ -67,6 +67,12 @@\n     stopSet = StopFilter.makeStopSet(stopWords);\n   }\n\n+  /** Builds the named analyzer with the given stop words. */\n+  public SnowballAnalyzer(Version matchVersion, String name, Set stopWordsSet) \n{\n+    this(matchVersion, name);\n+    stopSet = stopWordsSet;\n+  }\n+",

I always prefer an empty collection over null so you can simply replace the null checks with stopSet.isEmpty(). \u2013 kind of unrelated and we can do in sep. issue if you want. ",
