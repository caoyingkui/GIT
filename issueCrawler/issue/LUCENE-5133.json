            "content": "Why not use Object like the patch on LUCENE-4906 and try to get some consistency:\nI can easily see this becoming hell because different expert users want different things.\n\nIt might work for your particular case to have String text + boolean, but other people might want to know crazy things like:\n\n\tscore for the passage\n\twhich multi-valued field instance they hit\n\tposition or something of the passage within the doc\n\n\n\nIn general I also think its really bad to add additional classes that users must learn (the previous api here is \"string\", which everyone already knows). \n\nanyway i dont care too much for this class, but I'd hate for us to make this mistake over on LUCENE-4906. I feel like the other highlighters already introduce way too many new classes (besides already known simple ones like IndexSearcher,TopDocs,String, etc) and it makes them difficult to use. ",
