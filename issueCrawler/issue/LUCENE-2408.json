    "description": "(Spinoff from LUCENE-2324).\n\nThe internal indexer (currently DocumentsWriter & its full indexing\nchain) has separate *PerThread objects holding buffered postings in\nRAM until flush.\n\nThe RAM efficiency of these buffers is very dependent on the term\ndistributions sent to each.\n\nAs an optimization, today, we use thread affinity (ie we try to assign\nthe same thread to the same *PerThread classes), on the assumption\nthat sometimes that thread may be indexing from its own source of\ndocs.  When the assumption applies it means we can have much better\noverall RAM efficiency since a single *PerThread set of classes handles\nthe term distribution for that source.\n\nIn the extreme case (many threads, each doing completely orthogonal\nterms, eg say different languages) this should be a sizable\nperformance gain.\n\nBut really this is a hack \u2013 eg if you index using a dedicated\nindexing thread pool, then thread binding has nothing to do with\nsource, and you have no way to get this optimization (even though\nit's still \"there\").\n\nTo fix this, we should add an optional get/setSourceID to Document.\nIt's completely optional for an app to set this... and if they do,\nit'd be a hint which IW can make use of (in an impl private manner).\nIf they don't we should just fallback to the \"best guess\" we use today\n(each thread is its own source).\n\nThe javadoc would be something like \"as a hint to IW, to possibly\nimprove its indexing performance, if you have docs from difference\nsources you should set the source ID on your Document\". And\nhow/whether IW makes use of this information is \"under the hood\"...",
