    "description": "Don't have a test yet: but this makes bare TermQuery (used for facet refinement).\n\nSimpleFacets.rangeCount is correct (it invokes FieldType.getRangeQuery...), but I'm concerned about the semantics here for terms.\n\nBecause FieldType.getFieldQuery is really more for an unstructured query, it shouldnt call this method. \n\nIts probably better if FieldType has an explicit method to make a structured term query (with getFieldQuery forwarding to that by default), but I dont want to make FieldType api confusing either...",
