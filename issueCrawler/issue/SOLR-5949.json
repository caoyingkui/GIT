    "description": "This seems a repeat of SOLR-261 which was fixed in 1.3 but I am seeing the same behavior described. When I have a stopword in a boolean query the resulting query is invalid. \n\ne.g. Document --> \"No Smoking Sign\"\nStopword: \"No\"\n\nQuery:\"No AND Smoking AND Sign\"\n\nThe resultant query is a boolean query with a blank field so an empty boolean query. This is expanding as \"? Smoking Sign\" which then leads to no matches as \"?\" AND \"Smoking\" AND \"sign\" has no match.\n\nThe expected behavior is to remove the empty boolean clause from the query. In the Analysis tool the parsing showing that \"No AND Smoking AND Sign\" analyzes to \"Smoke Sign\". I would expect the same behavior by the QueryParser, but this is not true. The real parsed query is trying to do the following: <empty boolean query> Smoke Sign.\n\nThe only workaround is to never allow stopwords in the query or turn off stopwords entirely.",

Boolean logic is allowed and listed as a feature of edismax. \n\nSee here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Extended+DisMax+Query+Parser\n\nThis is right off the Solr wiki page. Boolean operators are allowed. The issue is with stopwords combined with the Boolean operators.\n\nI am not searching with the quotes as a full phrase match. I just used that to highlight the issue. The search is sent over as q:(No AND Smoking AND Sign) and not q:\"No AND Smoking AND Sign\" which I believe you are indicating. I know that is not supported. But I am not doing a phrase query "

            "content": "Bob: based on the information you've provided here, there is not enough info/evidence to reproduce the problem you are describing (in either 4.3.1, or 4.7.1).\n\nPlease post a question to the solr-user list, and provide all of the details about what your configuration looks like (schema.xml and solrconfig.xml), what your data looks like, and what exactly your requests look like including what debugQuery output you get.  In general, you should always send questions like this to the mailing list, which is the primary forum for seeking help, and only file a Jira issue for a Bug once there is reproducible confirmation (or if requested by a dev \u2013 sometimes even if folks can't reproduce it's helpful to create a jira to track it and upload detailed logs.)\n\n\n\nMy best off the cuff guesses, are that either you are using a phrase query even though you don't realize it, or that you have an edismax configuration that results in a query clause being created for your \"no\" word even though you think it's a stopword \u2013 ie becuase of how your qf fields are configured.
