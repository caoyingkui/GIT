            "content": "Here the patch just for review!\n\nYou cannot really apply it as it does not contains changes that are simply svn copied from flex (that are all new files added by flex). The idea behind this patch is only that everybody working on flex should scroll through it and verify that actually changed files are fine; e.g. we did not miss a change to trunk in flex (such a missing merge would apply as a \"revert\" in the patch).\n\nMy working copy tests fine, only solr is not compiling anymore because of recent changes in NumericUtils internal class that are non backwards compatible. I will commit this patch before and break solr, but will fix it soon! ",
