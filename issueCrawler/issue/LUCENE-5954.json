The version of the commit itself is somewhat unrelated, but its sorta bogus its not exposed to the user. I think currently our IndexUpgrader will fail to properly upgrade an empty commit for example. There isn't even a simple way to check \n\nIMO any version(s) should be ordered before the segments, so we don't try to e.g. load up old codecs that are too old/not there. This will clean up the current logic of readCodec() ",
