    "description": "This interface existed for backcompat, so that each impl had at least some common minimal interface, and could be used by StandardTokenizer.  However, in LUCENE-5999 backcompat for standard tokenizer was implemented using separate named classes.  We should remove this interface, as it no longer serves a purpose.",

I don't see it nuked in the patch. \n\nI think this is ok to commit, personally i would go just a step further and instead remove StandardTokenizerImpl and so on too. without the interface, this abstraction isn't needed, the StandardTokenizer.jflex can just generate StandardTokenizer.java and StandardTokenizer40.jflex -> StandardTokenizer40.java and so on.

            "content": "I checked in as is (with the deletion of course), but I don't have a problem with continuing this work to nuke the Impl classes.  The only caveat I see is this would require embedding a small amount of java code (100+ lines or so?) into the jflex files.  This may not be ideal if/when the tokenizer api is tweaked, and this functions need to be iterated on.  But that is so rare it probably doesn't matter.  Or maybe I am missing something and it is simpler than it looks to me.  Either way, if you feel getting rid of the separate impls will make this even cleaner, then we can open another issue and I'm happy to help there. ",
