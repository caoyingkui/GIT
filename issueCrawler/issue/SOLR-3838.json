And if I do manually delete the text of the last entry, I have this annoying empty box that can't be deleted. And if I hit refresh, everything gets reset.\n\nI am not a UI designer, but it might be nicer to have both \"+\" and \"-\" on each row. The \"-\" would let me delete the last row, and the \"+\" on the non-last rows would insert a blank row after the current row. If there is only one row left, \"-\" would simply clear its text but leave it.\n\nIs there any way for me to capture a query after I have gone though all this trouble to create it? I mean, why not store the parameters in the display URL so I can copy and paste it? "
