    "description": "its been discussed here and there, but I think we need to drop java 5 \"support\", for these reasons:\n\n\tits totally untested by any continual build process. Testing java5 only when there is a release candidate ready is not enough. If we are to claim \"support\" then we need a hudson actually running the tests with java 5.\n\tits now unmaintained, so bugs have to either be hacked around, tests disabled, warnings placed, but some things simply cannot be fixed... we cannot actually \"support\" something that is no longer maintained: we do find JRE bugs (http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/SunJavaBugs) and its important that bugs actually get fixed: cannot do everything with hacks.\n\tbecause of its limitations, we do things like allow 20% slower grouping speed. I find it hard to believe we are sacrificing performance for this.\n\n\n\nSo, in summary: because we don't test it at all, because its buggy and unmaintained, and because we are sacrificing performance, I think we need to cutover the build system for the next release to require java 6.",

They haven't patched Java 5 in quite some time. When Lucene went to Java 5, Java 1.4 was still being patched.\n\nI think most will be running Lucene under Java 6 (excepting some versions of Mac OS X and hardware. E.g. Core Duo Macs can't run Java 6).\n\nI'd like to see that we have api compatibility w/ Java 5 (i.e. it can compile against Java 5), but certify against Java 6. This would allow it to run under Java 5, with the appropriate caveats that it is not supported or tested.\n\nIf you do go to Java 6 features, then I think it has to be a 4.0 release and the planned 4.0 might need to be bumped to a 5.0 designation.
