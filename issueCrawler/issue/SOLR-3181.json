    "description": "When tracking down issues with ZK, the devs ask about various bits of data from the cloud pages. It would be convenient to be able to just capture all the data from the old /solr/admin/zookeeper.jsp page in the admin interface to be able to send it to anyone debugging the info. \n\nPerhaps just a \"get debug info for Apache\". Or even more cool \"copy debug info to clipboard\" if that's possible. Is this just the raw data that the cloud view is manipulating? It doesn't have to be pretty although indentation would be nice.",

Just format it, like it's the best for you (as dev) to work with and i'll try to generate it like that?\n\nSecond (you knew it, right? *g), copying to the Clip should be easy while using http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/ . If the Browser does not support this, we could just show a Layer containing the Output so that the User could manually copy + paste it.\n\n\u2013 Edit\n\nAh, just to mention it .. the \"Content Preview\" as it's available in the old interface was dropped it .. i don't know if this is really helpful? Most of the Files are just showing the included License-Header, and even if they start with real content, it's truncated :/ "

            "content": "bq: ...what data should be included?\n\nAll of it <G>. The idea here is someone says \"I'm having trouble\", and we can reply \"copy me all the data when you press ###\". Don't get me wrong, the navigation is great. But a new user (or even an experienced one) doesn't necessarily know which bits are important. I'm thinking if they had a \"get troubleshooting dump\" button that went out and got, as a start, the raw page that pops up in the old zookeeper.jsp page however ugly, it'd save a world of back-and-forth.\n\nAnd if the schema.xml and solrconfig.xml available through the Cloud stuff (for any node) were available, well!\n\nAnd as to how it gets shown, whether copied to clipboard or not I leave as an exercise to the implementer <G>..
