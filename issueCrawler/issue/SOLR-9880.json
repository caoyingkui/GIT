    "description": "Originally SOLR-4735 provided implementations for these reporters (wrappers for Dropwizard components to use SolrMetricReporter API).\n\nHowever, this functionality has been split into its own issue due to the additional transitive dependencies that these reporters bring:\n\n\n\tGanglia:\n\t\n\t\tmetrics-ganglia, ASL, 3kB\n\t\tgmetric4j (Ganglia RPC implementation), BSD, 29kB\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tGraphite\n\t\n\t\tmetrics-graphite, ASL, 10kB\n\t\tamqp-client (RabbitMQ Java client, marked optional in pom?), ASL/MIT/GPL2, 190kB\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nIMHO these are not very large dependencies, and given the useful functionality they provide it's worth adding them.",

            "content": "May I recommend a different approach?  With the current approach you'll always have somebody come in and ask for additional reporter and typically that won't be very high on Solr devs' interest, plus it will require more work, additional dependencies, etc.  Moreover, if you do this then you have to think about things like destination not being available, about possible on-disk buffering so data is not lost, about ensuring the buffered data is purged if there is too much of it, and so on.  Solr doesn't want to be in data shipper business.  My suggestion, based on working with monitoring and logging for the last N years - just log metrics to a file.  There are a number of modern tools that know how to tail files, parse their content, ship it somewhere, have buffering, have multiple outputs, and so on.  Just make sure data is nicely structured to make parsing easy, and done in a way that when you add more metrics you can do it in a backwards-compatible way. ",

            "content": "I understand your concern. However, these two reporters seemed like a natural addition for several reasons:\n\n\tthey are already a part of the Metrics distribution,\n\tthey are maintained in the upstream package.\n\tthey integrate with popular systems,\n\tin particular, Graphite protocol is so dead simple that it could be re-used by other systems, too - it just sends plain-text lines to a socket, with the name of the metric, its value and timestamp separated by space:\n\nmyPrefix.solr.node.cores.lazy 0 1482394715\nmyPrefix.solr.node.cores.loaded 1 1482394715\nmyPrefix.solr.node.cores.unloaded 0 1482394715\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you raise a good point - we should provide a file-based reporter too, as the lowest common denominator reporting mechanism... In fact, one is already included in the Metrics distribution  - the Slf4jReporter - and it's trivial to add a wrapper. This reporter could use a Logger per metrics group (configurable), so it should be easy to tweak the logging configuration so that its output goes to separate file(s) with rolling. ",

Logger names follow the metric group names by default, so you can have different files for \"solr.jvm\", \"solr.core\", \"solr.node\" etc - or you can override this and put all groups into a single logger.
