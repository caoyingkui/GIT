Because it has an external file configuration, it should be visible through the system stats component.\n\nThe simplest way to handle both ExternalFileField and QueryElevationComponent to do the same thing that JSP pages and Solr's XSLT processor do: poll the file modification time.If it has changed within the past N minutes, reinit.\n\nA more general-purpose way to do it is to somehow get each EFF field registered as a SolrMBean. At that point, all EFF and Elevation instance have XPath names in the SystemInfoHandler. Then, add a 'Reload' interface to EFF and QEC and a 'Find and Reload' AdminHandler that takes and XPath, finds the MBean, and calls 'reload()'. "
