    "description": "The bmax query parser is an extension to the edismax query parser. It does some query preprocessing and does more comprehensive synonym lookup. It distinguishes between directional synonyms as well as boost and penalize terms. It relies on field types and tokenizer chains to parse the user query, discover synonyms, boost and penalize terms at query time. Hence it is highly configurable. The lucene query composed is a boosted and reranked dismax query with a minimum must match of 100%.\n\nAll sources and documentation is currently available here: https://github.com/shopping24/solr-bmax-queryparser\n\nIf this is query parser is interesting for Solr, we will create a pull request. The bmax parser has been running in production for about 2 years now and is actively maintained.",
