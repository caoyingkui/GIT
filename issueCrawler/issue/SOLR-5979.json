    "description": "The idea is to have the user be able to supply JavaScript expressions that bind the old value for a field that needs to be updated (regular atomic update as well as docvalue update). \n\nProposing a \"expr\" update operator, which takes in the script as the value, for this feature (alongside the already existing \"add\", \"set\", \"inc\"). \n\nSome context here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-5944?focusedCommentId=13963663&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13963663\n\n(One example where it could've been personally useful to me was an update to numeric values in documents where I had to introduce a logarithmic decay of the boost values based on the age of the documents. As it turned out, I had to maintain the old values outside the system, i.e. in HDFS.. yuck!)",
