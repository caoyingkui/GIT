    "description": "This method is \"banned\" already because it can crawl slowly across large object graphs. \n\nI think it should be in the test framework. It needs enhancements for testing such as some way to filter what is crawled.\n\nCurrently lots of code in lucene tries to provide accounting information but its all totally untested. We need to fix the test situation or remove Accountable and such methods completely.",
