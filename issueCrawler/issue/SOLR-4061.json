SOLR-4052 was my first cut at it, but unfortunately you can only upload files, you can't seem to select a directory and upload everything in it into ZK. "

For example, in our hack projects we put a single Solr up on Amazon EC2.  And I've used the zkcli client to upload configs to that shared Solr so I didn't need filesystem access.  \n\nMaybe though I am haring off into the weeds of a ZK admin interface, not Solr specific enough.\n\nOne thought I have is what if you can supply a URI instead?  Use commons-vfs maybe, so you can pass in a  "

I'm not sure how this could be implemented to take files from the client server without sending the files one by one, any ideas?\nIn the case of the CloudSolrServer, it could specifically have a method to upload a conf directory to zk directly, but this would be outside of the Collections API, and won't be usable if you use any other way to connect to Solr.
