    "description": "Solr is used as a component in a couple of sister Apache projects, such as Nutch, Camel, NiFi.\n\nMost of the implementations/bridges/integrations are based on old Solr releases, not taking into account managed schemas, new startup scripts and new Admin UI/API possibilities.\n\nIt would be extremely useful for a person familiar with Solr to review those setups, determine the best way to upgrade to latest Solr functionality and work with members of both Solr and sister project communities to provide better instructions, schemas, and code.",
