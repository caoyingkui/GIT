    "description": "MemoryIndex can now store payloads (LUCENE-6155), and there's a corresponding boolean flag setter on QueryScorer (used by the default highlighter).  We should add a parameter to toggle this.  It will only take effect if hl.usePhraseHighlighter=true and the source of the tokens comes from re-analysis.  This settings is ignored if the tokens come from term vectors which support payloads already (in Lucene/Solr 5) provided they are there.\n\nI suggest naming this boolean parameter hl.payloads.",
