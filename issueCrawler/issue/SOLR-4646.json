I would think that as a general proposition, intentional, incompatible behavior changes should be limited to major releases of trunk, and not to dot releases, where the expectation is that existing apps should still \"just work\" unless the issue is clearly a bug. In this case, sure, some people consider it a bug, but the reality is that they just don't like the default for some cases.\n\nSo, if you want to propose this \"improvement\" for trunk, 5.0, fine. But I don't think it is appropriate to change the rules of the road in a dot release - unless it is a compelling, global problem - which it doesn't appear to be. I mean, the subset of apps that do have an issue with this have a very simple workaround (set lowercaseOperators to false in \"defaults\" in their query request handler.)\n\nAnd to be clear, support for lower case operators is an intentional feature. Granted, not everyone agrees, now.\n "

Google.com enforces uppercase operators - probably because of user confusion and wrong results with lowercase - so why should we set the bar lower?\n\n+1 to change the default from true to false (don't care which version, 4.3 or 5.0)\n\nThis issue also touches SOLR-3580 which proposes to replace the lowercaseOperators param with a more flexible variant.

I won't strenuously resist the proposed change.\n\nIn some sense, it is a reasonable change - edismax is closer to the traditional Solr query parser.\n\nBut, in a larger sense, the original goal od edismax was to try to establish a new and higher bar of usability - the idea that you have to use upper case for keywords is a holdover from the crude old days of search. Sure, we have the option to disable this \"improvement\", but somehow the cultural knowledge of the motivation for that improvement seems to have gotten lost, and now people are retreating to the barbaric past of primitive search.\n\nAlso, the discussion has failed to note that the pf2 and pf3 parameters will actually include the operator keywords for phrase boosting. For example, a query for \"in and out or not\" (no quotes) will do boosting for \"in and out\", \"and out or\", and \"out or not\", so relevance will be quite decent - even or Norwegion text!\n\nSo, I don't see what significant downside the proposed change would fix, at the cost of defaulting to a more old-fashioned approach to search.

Allowing lowercase operators, as it's currently implemented in edismax is trappy.  A user might type \"foo bar or baz\", and based on how edismax is implemented, \"foo\" will always be BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD  ('mm' is ignored, 'q.op' is ignored).  I'd feel better about it if in this mode, the default operator was set to AND.  Nonetheless I think this feature is trappy; users don't necessarily know this syntax and it's implications. "

            "content": "The comment from David Smiley talks about implementation.  My opinion below is about the default setting.\n\nI think the default should be false.  There are plenty of situations where the word that gets turned into an operator is better suited as part of the query.  For example, \"q=peaches and cream\" is an example where \"and\" as a term can be extremely important to obtaining relevant results.  Depending on the content in the index, it can be a very different query than \"q=peaches AND cream\".  With the current default, you can only achieve the latter query, unless you do tricks like stick an escape in the operator:\n\n\nq=peaches an\\d cream\n\n\n\nLowercase operators is a feature that many people want, so it's a good thing that we have this setting.  In my opinion, enabling it by default is the wrong thing to do. "
