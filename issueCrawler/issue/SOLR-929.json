    "description": "There appears to be an error in the admin interface (/solr/admin/schema.jsp) when using a '*' field in a schema.  In the example\nschema.xml, there is a commented out sample:\n\n\n \n  <!-- uncomment the following to ignore any fields that don't\nalready match an existing\n       field name or dynamic field, rather than reporting them as an error.\n       alternately, change the type=\"ignored\" to some other type e.g.\n\"text\" if you want\n       unknown fields indexed and/or stored by default -->\n  <!--dynamicField name=\"*\" type=\"ignored\" /-->\n\n \n\nWe have this un-commented, and in the schema browser via the admin interface I see that all non-dynamic fields get a type of \"ignored\".\n\nfor example, I see this in the Solr admin interface:\n\nField: uid\nDynamically Created From Pattern: *\nField Type: ignored\n\nthough the field definition is:\n\n \n  <field name=\"uid\"  type=\"integer\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>",
