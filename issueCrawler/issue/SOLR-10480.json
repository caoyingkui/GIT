    "description": "I have a SolrCloud cluster and when I use the JSON facet API to do term faceting like this:\njson.facet={\"results\":{\"type\": \"terms\", \"field\": \"my_field\", \"limit\": 100, \"offset\": 100, \"numBuckets\": true}}\nit does work correctly. \nHowever the numBuckets tells me in return that I have more than 6 millions buckets but as soon as I start to grow the offset value to browse these buckets, it doesn't return anything anymore (when I reach an offset of around 300).\nWhat is even weirder is that if I put a bigger limit, like 10'000, I can increase the offset until around 29'000 before it doesn't return anything.\nAnd the returned numBuckets doesn't change all the while.\n\nIt is a big problem because we can't paginate till the end of the buckets.\n\nMight be related to SOLR-7452, I don't know...",

            "content": "This is definitely an issue about the pagination and not about the estimate of numBuckets. Indeed if for one faceted query I put a limit of 100 I can go up to an offset of around 300 before the query doesn't return anything anymore (which would mean that there are around 300 buckets), while with the same query but a limit of 10'000, I can go up to around 30'000 for the offset (which means that there are definitely a lot more than 300 buckets).
