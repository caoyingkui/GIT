However, our implementation is based on json faceting on Solr v 6.1.0\n\nSELECT sl1, gc_2, sum(product_bkgs)\nFROM collection1\nWHERE sl2 : (\"xyz\")\nGROUP BY gc_2 \nORDER BY sl1 asc \nLIMIT 25\n\nSchema is single valued fields (each document just like row in database). \nORDER BY fields sl1,sl2,fieldA, fieldB are non-numeric.\ngc2 field is concatenation of sl1,sl2,fieldA, fieldB values.\nThere may be any number of documents in each gc_2 bucket. But each gc_2 bucket will have one unique sl1,sl2,fieldA, fieldB value.\n\nAbility to sort (asc|desc) on sl1,sl2,fieldA, fieldB is the use case.\n ",
