    "description": "LatLonPoint needed two-phase intersection initially because of big inefficiencies, but as of LUCENE-7239 all of its query operations:  newBoxQuery(), newDistanceQuery(), newPolygonQuery() and nearest() only need the points datastructure (BKD).\n\nIf you want to do newDistanceSort() then you need docvalues for that, but I think it should be moved to a separate field: e.g. docvalues is optional just like any other field in lucene. We can add other methods that make sense to that new docvalues field (e.g. facet by distance/region, expressions support, whatever). It is really disjoint from the core query support: and also currently has a heavyish cost of ~64-bits per value in space.",

            "content": "Here is a patch splitting it out.\n\nI ran rough indexing benchmark with luceneutil:\n\nprevious (docvalues + points):\nINDEX SIZE: 1.0679643917828798 GB\n380.419779939 sec to index part 0\n\npatch (points only)\nINDEX SIZE: 0.6146336644887924 GB\n359.832694579 sec to index part 0\n\nSo it doesn't buy you a lot on index time, but helps index-size if you don't need sorting or similar. And it keeps the stuff organized similar to other fields in core. "
