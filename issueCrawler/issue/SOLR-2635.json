If there is at least One, which is used more than once \u2013 the relation is only defined through the order of the list, but we could maybe add an counter to the existing output, then it's also no problem :>  "

But thats of course the same for highlighting.\n\nThe list of tokenizers and filters is not necessarily unique, but order would be, so access via index (like for highlighting) is fine. Its possible to add the same TokenFilter at several places in the analysis chain, so a lookup by class name is impossible. "

Also the CharFilter output would need some improvements (I prefer to return the CharFilter output like a single token in other compoenents, currently its one level higher - it has no <lst>).
