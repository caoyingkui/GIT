    "description": "Currently, tests get a random seed, and several possibilities can be randomly assigned, or fixed to\nspecific values with -Dtests.codec or -Dtests.directory.\n\nThe default values for these sort of things is 'random'.\n\nI think it would be a great improvement if we:\n\n\timproved our code here so that we always consume the same amount from the Random. this means for example, if you specific -Dtests.directory=RAMDirectory, we should consume a wasted int, where we would normally pick one from random.\n\tin 3.x, i think its worth it to actually consume wasted ints where 4.0 picks the codec.\n\n\n\nWith these changes, you could ideally (in many situations situations)\n\n\ttake a failure and modify parameters to see if its specific to a particular codec or directory, or a general problem\n\ttake a failure from trunk and see if it affects 3.x",
