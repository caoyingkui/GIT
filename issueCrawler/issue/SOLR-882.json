In certain applications padding emitted after entities such as \u00f3 may split words that are in fact single terms.\n\tadd entities that are recognized when written all in uppercase and recognized by browsers.",

What you saw in there was a dump of entities that I had to make in order to test which entities are recognized in uppercase mode and which were not. Apologies that this slipped through somehow. Do you want me to remove this from the patch or can you simply disregard the fragment that applies to the main method?  "
