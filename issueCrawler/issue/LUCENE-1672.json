    "description": "During investigation of LUCENE-1658, I found out, that even LUCENE-1453 is not completely fixed.\nAs 1658 deprecates all FSDirectory.getDirectory() static factories, we should not use them anymore. As the user is now free to choose the correct directory implementation using direct instantiation or using FSDir.open() he should no longer use all ctors/methods in IndexWriter/IndexReader/IndexSearcher & Co. that simply take path names as String or File and always instantiate the Directory himself.\n\nLUCENE-1453 currently works for the cached directory implementations from FSDir.getDirectory, but not with uncached, non refcounting FSDirs. Sometime reopen() closes the directory (as far as I see, when a SegmentReader changes to a MultiSegmentReader and/or deletes apply). This is hard to track. In Lucene 3.0 we then can remove the whole bunch of closeDirectory parameters/fields in these classes and simply do not care anymore about closing directories.\n\nTo remove this closeDirectory parameter now (before 3.0) and also fix 1453 correctly, an additional idea would be to change these factories that take the File/String to return the IndexReader wrapped by a FilteredIndexReader, that keeps track on closing the underlying directory after close and reopen. This is simplier than passing this boolean between different DirectoryIndexReader instances. The small performance impact by wrapping with FilterIndexReader should not be so bad, because the method is deprecated and we can state, that it is better to user the factory method with Directory parameter.",

If we wrap this using this FilterIndexReader, ok, but as discussed yesterday, I would prefer to simply only allow Directory as input parameter and leave specifying the dir impl to the user. Automatically use FSDir.open() is also not the best choose, because then user ask again of java-user (how to specify another impl and so on).\nFor the user it is just a little bit more code and the additional close() call (which can normally left out for standard directories...)

I am not sure, if I hit all, if somebody knows another one, tell it.\n\nThis patch also replaces FSDirectory.getDirectory() by FSDirectory.open() for all non-deprecated methods. The deprecated IndexReader/IndexWriter and so on methods still use FSDir.getDirectory because they sometimes depend on refCounting (which is wrong). This is a bug related to LUCENE-1453.\n\nI will post a later patch that fixes this by wrapping all IndexReaders instantiated by File/String with a FilterIndexReader that manages the closing of the underlying directory. All closeDirectory/closeDir pass-throughs everywhere can then be removed.\n\nThis also fixes a small bug in IndexModifier to close the directory on close() when dir was given as File/String.\n\nI also removed File/String in the segment file finder (non-public API).
