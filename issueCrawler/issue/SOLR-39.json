    "description": "SolrIndexSearcher's getDocListAndSet methods do not accept flags, which can, in some cases, cause a Null Pointer Exception to be thrown when writing the docListAndSet.docList as output.  I came across the issue as I was implementing faceting, see http://www.nabble.com/Faceted-Browsing-Question-Discussion-tf1968854.html for the discussion.\n\nThe simplest way to reproduce this is to modify DisMaxRequestHandler, by changing this:\n\n DocList results = s.getDocList(query, restrictions,\n                                     SolrPluginUtils.getSort(req),\n                                     req.getStart(), req.getLimit(),\n                                     flags);\n      rsp.add(\"search-results\",results);\n\nto\n\n      DocListAndSet listAndSet= s.getDocListAndSet(query, restrictions,\n                                     SolrPluginUtils.getSort(req),\n                                     req.getStart(), req.getLimit());\n      DocList results = listAndSet.docList;\n      rsp.add(\"search-results\",results);\n\nThe root cause appears to be that the scores[] is set to null, so then the DocIterator and its score() method is called, return scores[pos-1] will give null.  When getDocListAndSet(..) is invoked, it eventually can get down to this private method:\n\n  private DocSet getDocListAndSetNC(DocListAndSet out, Query query, DocSet filter, Sort lsort, int offset, int len, int flags) throws IOException\n\nIn that method, scores is assigned as follows:\n\n      scores = (flags&GET_SCORES)!=0 ? new float[nDocsReturned] : null;\n\nSince getDocListAndSet() does not pass flags (except for the implicit GET_DOCSET), scores is assigned as null, which eventually leads to the NullPointerException if you try to output the docList .  The attached patch does not change the underlying mechanism of how scores is assigned, but works around the issue by adding overloaded getDocListAndSet() methods that take an additional flags parameter.  After applying this patch, you can change the relevant bit in DisMaxRequestHandler to:\n\n      DocListAndSet listAndSet= s.getDocListAndSet(query, restrictions,\n                                     SolrPluginUtils.getSort(req),\n                                     req.getStart(), req.getLimit(), flags);\n      DocList results = listAndSet.docList;\n      rsp.add(\"search-results\",results);\n\nand you will no longer see the NullPointerException",
