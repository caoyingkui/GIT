    "description": "A patch for RAMDirectory that makes it clonable.\n\nMay 22nd, 2003 contribution from \"Nick Smith\" <nick.smith@techop.ch>\n\nOriginal email:\nHi Lucene Developers,\n   Thanks for a great product!\n\nI need to be able to 'snapshot' our in-memory indices (RAMDirectory\ninstances).\n\nI have been using :\n\nRAMDirectory activeDir = new RAMDirectory();\n// many inserts, deletes etc\nRAMDirectory cloneDir = new RAMDirectory(activeDir);\n\nbut unfortunately this is rather slow for large indices.\n\nI have a suggestion - implement java.lang.Cloneable interface\nin RAMDirectory.  I.e to be able to call :\n\nRAMDirectory cloneDir = (RAMDirectory)activeDir.clone();\n\nThis bypasses the input/output stream handling of the\ncopy constructor by cloneing the underlying buffers that\nform the directory and is much faster. (Diff attached).\n\nAny comments?\n\nRegards,\n\nNick",
