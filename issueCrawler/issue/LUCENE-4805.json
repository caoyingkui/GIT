    "description": "If your test needs 4.2 features (e.g. @SuppressCodecs' Lucene40, Lucene41), when you run 'ant test' it does the right thing, and picks the right codecs.\n\nBut from eclipse instead it often ignores all test methods and prints:\nNOTE: Class not allowed to use postings format: Lucene41. Suppressed codecs: [Lucene41, Lucene40]\n\nYou can reproduce this by adding this to e.g. TestDemo and running it from ant vs eclipse:\n\n\n@SuppressCodecs({\"Lucene40\", \"Lucene41\"})\n\n\n\nI havent had time to dig into this yet, but its annoying for eclipse developers. some property must have a bad default value or something thats inconsistent with what ant sets: somehow ant is doing it right.\n\nI gather it probably happens to other IDEs too.",

            "content": "The problem could be related to the fact that SuppressCodecs is like... overloaded to prevent any Codec, PostingsFormat, DocValuesFormat, etc from being used...and we are still using Lucene41 PostingsFormat today. But its so convenient: I'd almost rather try to improve and make a new Lucene42PostingsFormat than change this.\n\nand this still doesn't explain why it works for ant. ",
