    "description": "At the moment, wherever InterruptedException is caught, it's merely logged.  In all cases, we should consider propagating the interruption instead - after all, InterruptedExceptions happen for a reason.  For a better explanation than I can manage of why it would be wise to consider propagation of some kind, see http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05236.html.\n\nIn solr 1.3 trunk as at 15th August, InterruptedException is handled in SolrCore, RunExecutableListener, DirectUpdateHandler and DirectUpdateHandler2.",
