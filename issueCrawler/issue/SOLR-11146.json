I have included the tests and bug fixes in the same pull request since the tests require the bug fixes to run correctly.\n\nA few features have been added in the pull request as well, that couldn't be easily separated from the bug fixes. The new features include:\n\n\tAn `exists()` mapping function.\n\tMapping functions of constants are automatically converted to constants themselves, so they don't need to be computed for every document.\n\n ",
