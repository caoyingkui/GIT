    "description": "This is handy for searching log indices and in all other situations where indices are added (and possibly deleted) over time.  Index aliasing allows one to map an arbitrary set of indices to an alias and avoid needing to change the search application to point it to new indices.\n\nSee http://search-lucene.com/m/YBn4w1UAbEB\n\nIt may also be worth thinking about using aliases when indexing.  This question comes up once in a while on the ElasticSearch mailing list for example.\nSee http://search-lucene.com/?q=index+time+alias&fc_project=ElasticSearch&fc_type=mail+_hash_+user",
