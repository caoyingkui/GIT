As a result, both solr-core and solrj resources are co-mingled.  I think this is what's happening here: due to the apparently non-deterministic solr-home detection logic, in some environments, the \"wrong\" schema.xml file is used with some tests. "

I reverted the branch_4x dependency to Tika 1.1, and branch_4x Maven just succeeded on ASF Jenkins.\n\nI also committed a change to all Solr contribs removing the now unnecessary inclusion of solr-core test resources in their test classpaths.
