LUCENE-1435: Added contrib/collation, a CollationKeyFilter\n    allowing you to convert tokens into CollationKeys encoded usign\n    IndexableBinaryStringTools.  This allows for faster RangQuery when\n    a field needs to use a custom Collator.  (Steven Rowe via Mike\n    McCandless)\n\n\n\nSo I think its good for someone to understand they can use this package for more than just range queries: sorting and searching! ",
