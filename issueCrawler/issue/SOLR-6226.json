Before email field had type string.  I reindexed solr, for some reasons it worked fine for a while but stopped working again.\nExample of queries:\nname:John* (works on all fields have got this value or if it starts with this value)\nemail:example@hotmail.com* ( doesn't work)\nemail:example@hotmail.com ( works)\nemail:example@hotmail* (doesn't work)",
