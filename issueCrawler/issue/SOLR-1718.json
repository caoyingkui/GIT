With a <input type=\"text\" /> box the browser already takes care of submitting the form if you hit Enter (and FWIW: most browsers i know of also submit forms if you use \"Shift-Enter\" in a <textarea />)\n\nIt sounds like what you are really suggesting is that we change the /admin/index.jsp form to use a <input type=\"text\" /> instead of a <textarea /> for the \"q\" param, and not that we add special (javascript) logic to the form to submit if someone presses Enter inside the existing <textarea />  ... which i have a lot less objection to then going out of our way to violate standard form convention.

I left the full-interface alone; perhaps that's more contentious.  \n\nAlso, I changed the example solr config to make the defaultSearch \"*:*\" instead of \"solr\".  FYI other solrconfig.xml's already have this like example-DIH/solr/tika/conf/solrconfig.xml.   "
