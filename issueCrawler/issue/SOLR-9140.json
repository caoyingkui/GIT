This also seems to fix the occasional failures in TestCollectionStateWatchers where a node never properly comes up.\n\nThe original patch replaced some polling in the 'delete collection' handling part of OverseerCollectionMessageProcessor, but that caused some test failures where the client that was issuing the delete didn't get its collection state updated quickly enough and so was checking stale state.  One way round this might be to make the list-collection command go via the Overseer, so that it always gets the latest state, but that's for another issue.  For now I've just not included that change. ",
