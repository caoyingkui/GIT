    "description": "Across the code base, we have lots of:\n\nlong minValue, maxValue;\nfinal long delta = maxValue - minValue;\nfinal int bitsRequired = delta < 0 64 : Packedints.bitsRequired(delta);\n\n\n\nPackedints.bitsRequired(delta) doesn't work directly in that case since it expects a positive value. And that is important that it does so in order to get an error instead of silently being super wasteful if a negative value is provided.\n\nYet in some cases such as the one depicted above, the value should be interpreted as an unsigned long. So I propose to add another bitsRequired method that would interpret the value as unsigned.",

Consumers first need to call bitsRequired or unsignedBitsRequuired depending on their needs, and then to pass the result to DirectWriter.roundBits to get an amount of bits per value that is supported by the writer.
