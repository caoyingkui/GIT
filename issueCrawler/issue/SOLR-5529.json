    "description": "Following the discussion on SOLR-5528. It would be nice to support suggest queries to be processed by more than one suggesters configured in one suggest component.\n\nThe new response format is as follows:\n\n{\n    responseHeader: {\n        status: 0,\n        QTime: 3\n    },\n    suggest: {\n        suggester1: {\n            e: {\n                numFound: 1,\n                suggestions: [\n                    {\n                        term: \"electronics and computer1\",\n                        weight: 100,\n                        payload: \"\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        suggester2: {\n            e: {\n                numFound: 1,\n                suggestions: [\n                    {\n                        term: \"electronics and computer1\",\n                        weight: 10,\n                        payload: \"\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nwhere 'suggest1' and 'suggest2' are the names of the configured suggester and 'e' is the query.\n\nExample query:\n\nlocalhost:8983/solr/suggest?suggest=true&suggest.dictionary=suggest1&suggest.dictionary=suggest2&suggest.q=e\n\n\n\nExample configuration:\n\n  <searchComponent name=\"suggest\" class=\"solr.SuggestComponent\">\n  \t<lst name=\"suggester\">\n      <str name=\"name\">suggester1</str>\n      <str name=\"lookupImpl\">FuzzyLookupFactory</str>      \n      <str name=\"dictionaryImpl\">DocumentDictionaryFactory</str>      \n      <str name=\"field\">cat</str>\n      <str name=\"weightField\">price</str>\n      <str name=\"suggestAnalyzerFieldType\">string</str>\n    </lst>\n  \t<lst name=\"suggester\">\n      <str name=\"name\">suggester2</str>\n      <str name=\"lookupImpl\">FuzzyLookupFactory</str>      \n      <str name=\"dictionaryImpl\">DocumentDictionaryFactory</str>     \n      <str name=\"field\">name</str>\n      <str name=\"weightField\">price</str>\n      <str name=\"suggestAnalyzerFieldType\">string</str>\n    </lst>\n  </searchComponent>",
