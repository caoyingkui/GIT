    "description": "If you use a Managed resource of some kind and a configset, then changes made by one core affect all cores that use that configset.  Similarly in cloud mode, a change made on one collection affects all collections that use the same config.\n\nWhat I think would be more useful here would be if storageIO was per-collection, or per-core in non-cloud mode, and stored separately from the /config or configset.  The same thing probably applies to Noble's config-editing handlers, etc.\n\nThis also allows us to do things like make all resources read via the SolrResourceLoader immutable, and remove a whole bunch of 'if (resourceLoader instanceof ZkSolrResourceLoader)' warts all over the code.",
