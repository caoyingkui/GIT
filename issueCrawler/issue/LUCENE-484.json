    "description": "This is version 1.0 of my Java Content Repository Implementation (http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr170/index.html). \n\nThis was first discussed in the following thread: \nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/java-dev%40lucene.apache.org/msg02926.html\n\nThe implementation is now using fixed-size buffers.\n\nI've not joined an Ant build file because my TestCase is using Apache Jackrabbbit (JSR-170) and they don't currently don't offer binaries (the situation will probably change soon).\n\nThe actual classes only needs the \"jcr-1.0.jar\" which can be found in the specification download http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr170/index.html.\n\nComments are welcomed.\n\nRegards, \n\nNicolas B\u00e9lisle\nLaval University Library",
