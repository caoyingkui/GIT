            "content": "I still can't get this test to pass (and I don't want to change the default DNS on that build machine). Since this is failing in tests on real machines, I'm guessing it can also happen in the real world. The matcher selecting the host name/ ip address in ImplicitSnitchTest is very broad. We could restrict it, but this could have unexpected side-effects for people with funky hostnames. \n\nI'd rather just remove this particular test (testGetTags_with_wrong_ipv4_format_ip_returns_nothing). I didn't check whether dns with numbers only are valid (perhaps not at the global scale, but locally, within a nat network?), but if it's not explicitly forbidden then this test is checking a too strict assumption.
