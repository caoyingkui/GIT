    "description": "I have 18 SolrCloud nodes distributed across 3 Ec2 instances, so 6 per instance. One of my collections was created with all replicas landing on different SolrCloud nodes on the same instance. Ideally, SolrCloud would be a little smarter and ensure that at least one of the replicas was on one of the other hosts.\n\nshard4: {\n\thttp://ec2-??-??-??-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8988/solr/med_collection_shard4_replica1/ LEADER\n\thttp://ec2-??-??-??-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8984/solr/med_collection_shard4_replica3/ \n\thttp://ec2-??-??-??-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8985/solr/med_collection_shard4_replica2/ \n}\n\nI marked this as minor for now as it could be argued that I shouldn't be running that many Solr nodes per instance, but I'm seeing plenty of installs that are using higher-end instance types / server hardware and then running multiple Solr nodes per host.",

Everything is very basic right now and the intention has always been to make it much better - we want at least the option to take into account as much info as we can when choosing hosts (eventually, even hardware, avg load, whatever!).

You setup various states and check that the nodes chosen match what you expect or doesn't violate what you don't expect when passed to a method that returns which nodes where chosen to create on. \n\nA state is created via a short string ie csrsrrcr*r, so it ende up being simple and fast to test the hall out of this types of thing, and then you need less variation in any integration tests.
