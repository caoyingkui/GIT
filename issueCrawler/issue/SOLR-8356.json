    "description": "Hey,\n\nWatching the gap capability on the subfacets, I think it would be really great to have gaps on aggregated data. \nSo for example, if I want to see the total incomes made by all the companies in my system, grouped by a gap of total incomes, I imagine something like this:\n\n{\n  total_income: {\n    type: range,\n    field: income,\n    agggap: 1000,\n    facet: {\n      companies: {\n        type: terms,\n        field: company,\n        facet: \n{\n          sum_income: \"sum(income)\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nand the response something like this:\n{\n  \"val\": 1000,\n  \"count\": 7540,\n  \"companies\": {\n    \"buckets\": [\n      \n{\n        \"val\": \"Reebook\",\n        \"count\": 2322,\n        \"sum_income\": 1100\n      }\n,\n      \n{\n        \"val\": \"Nike\",\n        \"count\": 961,\n        \"sum_income\": 1699\n      }\n,\n      ...\n    ]\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"val\": 2000,\n  \"count\": 7540,\n  \"companies\": {\n    \"buckets\": [\n      \n{\n        \"val\": \"New Balance\",\n        \"count\": 248,\n        \"sum_income\": 2100\n      }\n,\n      \n{\n        \"val\": \"Jay\",\n        \"count\": 2001,\n        \"sum_income\": 2500\n      }\n,\n      ...\n    ]\n  }\n}",
