    "description": "To ensure section and page title uniqueness during conversion, we retained Confluence-style anchor references in the new .adoc files, which lead to long links and confusion about how to construct a link to another page/section. It was always the intention to remove these, but we didn't do it during the initial post-conversion cleanup and I neglected to file an issue for it.\n\nA script for this has been suggested, but that's problematic because many section titles are repeated on different pages (like \"Input\", etc.), and someone needs to decide how to modify the section titles to ensure clarity and uniqueness at the same time. Otherwise, Ref Guide builds will fail.",

I decided this was needed yesterday while working through the links, because I learned much more about the differences during the process than I knew before and I also knew the section was pretty light on info to start with.\n\nShould we add a note to meta-docs/asciidoc-syntax.adoc about the difference between implicit section achors and explicit ones, and that if you rename a section heading, you should add an explicit anchor not to break existing deep-links\n\nI didn't add this. It's already a bit fraught when you try to come up with a simple answer to the question \"How do I make a link to a section of another page?\" - I didn't want to add a decision tree to the equation. My goal in all of this is to make it simpler for anyone with an ounce of energy to help with the writing part.\n\nI'm not saying I disagree with a policy of trying to keep links from being dead, but I think there are some \"well, maybe not always...\" situations - I don't want to have to carry around refs to section titles from 15 releases ago because someone maybe has a bookmark to it. There are cases where we need to just rename it and fix any incoming references and move on. There are also other ways to deal with the problem of a dead reference - a helpful 404 page or actual search, to name a couple - that we should explore, which IMO are beyond the scope of this cleanup issue.
