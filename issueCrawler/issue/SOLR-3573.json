In the getData method, the characterStream from the Clob needs to be copied to a new stream, so the clob can be freed.",

            "content": "Some more information, for me this started to happen after we started storing XMLTYPE data as binary instead of CLOB. I managed to fix it by casting the java.sql.Clob to a oracle.sql.CLOB so I could use freeTemporary() to free the clob. Not an acceptable solution to commit though. Not sure if this is a solr problem, a JDBC problem or an oracle problem. "
