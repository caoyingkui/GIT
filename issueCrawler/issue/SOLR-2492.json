            "content": "This patch increments the # deleted documents once for each call to $deleteDocById and/or $deleteDocByQuery.  Note that it would be even better (especially with ..byQuery) to get the actual # of deleted documents and increment by that many.\n\nBy incrementing the # deleted documents, \"commit\" is called at the end of the run as expected.  This fixes the issue of commit not being called and also causes the # of deleted documents to be reported back to the user.  While this is better than current behavior, the actual # of reported deletions may not be accurate because a call to $deleteDocById may not actually delete a document.  Likewise a call to $deleteDocByQuery could delete more than 1 document (or none). \n\nA unit test is provided. "
