    "description": "Users encounter situations where SolrCloud detects the node IP address incorrectly, so a node gets inserted into the Zookeeper cluster with the incorrect address.\n\nIt would be very useful if there were a command in zkcli to remove a node (host:port_context) from the SolrCloud cluster information stored in zookeeper.  Manually editing the zookeeper database to remove a node is tedious and somewhat dangerous.\n\nOther situations where it would be useful are when a user needs to change the IP addressing on their SolrCloud cluster, and when an old node is retired.",

I'm pretty sure it works even if a node isn't there, so having an incorrect IP address seems like it should be OK, but I don't know for sure.\n\nOh bother. You specified a zkcli command, the collections API is just a different beast. ",
