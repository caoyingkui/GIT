Rather than take a config set name and directory, make it work like -Dboostrap_conf=true and read solr.xml to find config sets. Config sets will be named after the collection and auto linked to the identically named collection.",

            "content": "This little tool was original pretty modest in scope - it's clear we need more though, so I've already started on working on a 'next gen' version of this thing. Instead of a simple bootstrap cmd util, it will be our simple ZooKeeper CLI tool that can do a variety of things.\n\nIt will initially allow you to:\nbootstrap config based on solr.xml and local setup\nbootstrap a config dir to a named config set\nreverse the previous two (eg go from zk to local file system with config files)\nlink a specific collection to a config set name (even before startup up your cluster)\nclear ZooKeeper (for starting fresh)\n\nThis should make all of these tasks easily scriptable.

I'm going to commit this first iteration shortly.\n\nPart of this change allows you to setup collection to config links before solr even starts up in cloud mode - if on startup, a collection node with a given config already set is seen, it is simply used as is.\n\nThis should provide the flexibility of one of the more complicated cases that came up on the mailing list a couple months back.
