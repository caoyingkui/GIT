I have a feeling many of them assume that the stock start.jar starts with a single \"collection1\" core because of how the solr home used to be set up before, which is no longer true.\n\nWe can clean up or make these scripts better if we can get a better idea of how people use these scripts..

Some stay more up to date than others. They are for quickly launching in cloud mode and doing manual tests during development.\n\nPlease don't delete any of the scripts though. At most, I'd make a JIRA issue to discuss a removal, but there is one or two at most that could / should be removed.\n\nAlso, I'd prefer we didn't port these to work with the start scripts unless it becomes absolutely necessary. That just muddies the waters. Let's cross that bridge when it makes sense. ",
