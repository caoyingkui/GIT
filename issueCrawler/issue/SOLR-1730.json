Little does it know, the core is actually dead.  I don't particularly think we need to fix this other than to perhaps document it here, as I think, since things are undefined at this point b/c the core is dead, that we shouldn't care too much about these side consequences.

I logged that the core can't be created.\n3. If there is only 1 core being created, then this throws an exception up and out of Solr to the container.  Based on the docs, it seems different containers will deal with this as they see fit.  Jetty simply displays an error message.\n4. I marked the exception coming out of QEC as not logged yet.\n5. In the SolrCore initialization code, I changed from only catching IOException to catching Throwable.  I also then release the latch and close down any resources the core has allocated so far.  I had to release the latch in the catch block there otherwise the ExecutorService can't shutdown because it is blocked on the latch.\n\nI'm running full tests now. "
