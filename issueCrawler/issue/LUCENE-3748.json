    "description": "The current EnglishPossessiveFilter (used in EnglishAnalyzer) removes possessives using only the '\\'' character (plus 's' or 'S'), but some common systems (German?) insert the Unicode \"\\u2019\" (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) instead and this is not removed when processing UTF-8 text. I propose to change EnglishPossesiveFilter to support '\\u2019' as an alternative to '\\''.",

(By contrast, the Unicode standard says that U+2019 is the preferred apostrophe form.) ",
