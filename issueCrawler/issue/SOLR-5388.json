Extract method to get ability other MultiFloatFunction implementation to override it. \n\nExample: \nDoc1: Field1: \"10\", Field2: \"20\"\nDoc2: Field3: \"30\", FIeld4: \"40\"\nWe want to call user function \"def(min(Field1,Field2),5)\" for this documents :\nNow we've got:  Doc1 = 10, Doc2 = Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY\nWith this patch:  Doc1 = 10, Doc2 = 5 ( Doc2 doesn't have values for this documents, so he gets defValue)",
