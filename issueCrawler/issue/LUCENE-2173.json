    "description": "The Cartesian Tier filtering code in the spatial code can be simplified, tidied and generally improved.  Improvements include removing default field name support which isn't the responsibility of the code, adding javadoc, making method names more intuitive and trying to make the complex code in CartesianPolyFilterBuilder more understandable.\n\nFew deprecations have to occur as part of this work, but some public methods in CartesianPolyFilterBuilder will be made private where possible so future improvements of this class can occur.",
