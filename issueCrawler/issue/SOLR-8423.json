DELETEREPLICA on the other hand cleans up the data and instance directory.\n\nDELETESHARD should clean up the instance and data directory, so that we don't leak disk space on executing the command.\n\nIf we think this would break back-compat, though I don't see why this should not clean up the instance dir, we should at least provide an option to clean up everything and make it default in 6.0.",

            "content": "I don't think this breaks back-compat 'cause I don't see any promises in the docs  But I vaguely recall that this was to clean up stale cluster states without having to directly edit the ZK node, so maybe nobody thought about it?\n\nI might advocate an option to keep at least the data directory just on general principles here though. I'm thinking of the case where the user is explicitly controlling routing, say time-series data. Does it make sense to delete/create shards to hide/show some time-interval? I have to admit this is a theoretical use-case, haven't seen anyone actually ask for it so feel free to ignore... ",

No need to remember what a new vague sounding parameter does. deleteInstanceDir/deleteDataDir is as explicit as it gets. \n\nWhat the hell is a safedelete anyway?\n\n\tWe don't accidentally delete other's data?\n\tWe don't delete our data?\n\tWe ensure that data is actually deleted and cannot be recovered?\n\n\n\nIf you really want to keep things simple for users, do what deletereplica already does i.e. deletes instance dir, data dir, index automatically as we did in SOLR-6072. No switch necessary to control that. If you want to implement a way to control what gets deleted, implement it for both deleteshard and deletereplica and even better, just have deleteshard internally call deletereplica and avoid the code duplication.

I used CoreAdmin calls directly because I didn't want to stack up more tasks for the Overseer. It however makes sense to just refactor the coreadmin call code and reuse that.\n\nP.S: The meaning of 'safedelete' would have been clear through the ref guide/documentation. The difference between instance/data/index directory can get a little complicated for users though, specially as we're trying to move away from Core admin calls being exposed to end users (via http api).
