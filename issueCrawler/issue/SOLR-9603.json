    "description": "\"filter\" may be a bit of an overloaded term, but it would be nice to be able to filter facet buckets by additional things, like the metrics that are calculated per bucket.\n\nThis is like the HAVING clause in SQL.\n\nExample of a facet that would group by author, find the average review rating for that author, and filter out authors (buckets) with less than a 3.5 average.\n\n\nreviews : {\n  type : terms,\n  field: author,\n  sort: \"x desc\",\n  having: \"x >= 3.5\",\n  facet : {\n    x : avg(rating)\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThis functionality would also be useful for \"pushing down\" more calculations to the endpoints for streaming expressions / SQL.",
