    "description": "TopFieldCollector optimizes the single-comparator case. I think we could replace this specialization with a MultiLeafFieldComparator wrapper, similarly to how MultiCollector works. This would have the benefit of replacing code duplication of non-trivial logic with a simple wrapper that delegates calls to its sub comparators.",

            "content": "Here is a patch. Luceneutil reports no particular speedup or slowdown for the sorting tasks, which might mean this change makes the paging collector a bit faster in the case there is a single comparator, since we disabled the single-comparator optimization when paginating.\n\n\n                    TaskQPS baseline      StdDev   QPS patch      StdDev                Pct diff\n                  Fuzzy2      140.55      (9.2%)      138.08     (10.2%)   -1.8% ( -19% -   19%)\n                 Respell      261.06      (3.2%)      259.42      (3.1%)   -0.6% (  -6% -    5%)\n              AndHighMed      247.32      (1.9%)      246.06      (2.5%)   -0.5% (  -4% -    3%)\n            HighSpanNear       41.90      (2.5%)       41.69      (3.0%)   -0.5% (  -5% -    5%)\n                  Fuzzy1      120.80      (6.1%)      120.29      (5.2%)   -0.4% ( -11% -   11%)\n             LowSpanNear      190.79      (1.4%)      190.26      (1.4%)   -0.3% (  -3% -    2%)\n                  IntNRQ       19.82      (7.5%)       19.77      (7.2%)   -0.3% ( -13% -   15%)\n   HighTermDayOfYearSort       78.30      (4.7%)       78.16      (4.9%)   -0.2% (  -9% -    9%)\n                Wildcard      159.10      (3.4%)      158.92      (3.0%)   -0.1% (  -6% -    6%)\n               OrHighLow      105.11      (3.5%)      105.02      (3.6%)   -0.1% (  -6% -    7%)\n                 LowTerm      765.60      (3.4%)      765.00      (3.6%)   -0.1% (  -6% -    7%)\n                 MedTerm      299.61      (2.0%)      299.39      (2.3%)   -0.1% (  -4% -    4%)\n         MedSloppyPhrase       84.50      (3.8%)       84.48      (3.5%)   -0.0% (  -7% -    7%)\n        HighSloppyPhrase       21.42      (5.9%)       21.42      (5.7%)   -0.0% ( -10% -   12%)\n                 Prefix3       87.53      (4.4%)       87.56      (4.5%)    0.0% (  -8% -    9%)\n             MedSpanNear       54.81      (2.4%)       54.83      (2.8%)    0.0% (  -5% -    5%)\n            OrNotHighMed       87.63      (4.6%)       87.68      (4.9%)    0.1% (  -9% -   10%)\n               LowPhrase       78.09      (2.8%)       78.16      (2.7%)    0.1% (  -5% -    5%)\n              HighPhrase        4.38      (5.9%)        4.38      (5.7%)    0.1% ( -10% -   12%)\n       HighTermMonthSort      106.41      (9.3%)      106.56      (9.2%)    0.1% ( -16% -   20%)\n         LowSloppyPhrase       40.52      (2.5%)       40.58      (2.3%)    0.2% (  -4% -    5%)\n            OrHighNotMed       38.10      (9.7%)       38.16      (9.9%)    0.2% ( -17% -   21%)\n                HighTerm      105.43      (2.3%)      105.60      (2.7%)    0.2% (  -4% -    5%)\n           OrNotHighHigh       52.52      (5.2%)       52.60      (5.2%)    0.2% (  -9% -   11%)\n               OrHighMed       70.73      (5.5%)       70.88      (4.6%)    0.2% (  -9% -   10%)\n             AndHighHigh       85.67      (1.3%)       85.85      (1.3%)    0.2% (  -2% -    2%)\n              AndHighLow     1115.24      (3.3%)     1118.45      (3.1%)    0.3% (  -5% -    6%)\n           OrHighNotHigh       58.80      (5.5%)       58.97      (5.6%)    0.3% ( -10% -   12%)\n            OrNotHighLow      857.35      (4.3%)      860.72      (3.6%)    0.4% (  -7% -    8%)\n            OrHighNotLow      132.11      (9.6%)      132.70     (10.3%)    0.5% ( -17% -   22%)\n              OrHighHigh       20.51      (6.2%)       20.62      (5.6%)    0.5% ( -10% -   13%)\n               MedPhrase       80.54      (3.0%)       81.00      (2.4%)    0.6% (  -4% -    6%)\n\n ",
