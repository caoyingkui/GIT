    "description": "Solr depends on some modules from lucene, and is released separately (as a source release including lucene),\nthus its NOTICE.txt has a lucene section which includes notices from lucene:\n\n\n=========================================================================\n==  Apache Lucene Notice                                               ==\n=========================================================================\n\n\n\nhowever, its missing the IPADIC (which is required to be there).\n\nFurthermore, there is no way to check this, except via manual inspection.\n\nThis gets complicated in 4.0 because of modularization, but we need to fix the\n3.6 situation in order to release (hence, this issue is set to 3.6 only and\nwe can open a separate issue for 4.0 and discuss things like modules there,\nits irrelevant here).\n\nMy proposal for 3.6 is:\n1. add the IPADIC notice\n2. have smoketester.py look for this specific block of text indicating\n   the notices from lucene, and cross check them to ensure everything is consistent.",
