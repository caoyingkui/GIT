    "description": "ScoringNoMaxScoreCollector does like NonScoringCollector except that it computes the score for all competitive hits in order to have the score set on the final top hits.\n\nThis is inefficient since there are potentially many more competitive documents than the requested number of hits, especially if the index order is not random. We could instead compute the top hits with NonScoringCollector and then compute scores on these top hits only. Another nice side-effect is that it would help get rid of a TopFieldCollector specialization.",
