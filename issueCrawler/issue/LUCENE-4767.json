    "description": "A ResultMode.AUTO_EXPAND will auto-expand a node in tree if only one result came up. For example, if you have a Date facet, and you ask to count the top-K of Date/, then if your documents were all created in say 2010, you'll get a redundant facet back: Date/2010 (no other children of Date/).\n\nRather, since we already have all the categories counted at hand, we can \"auto-expand\" Date/2010 recursively, until we get to a level in the tree which has more than one children. And of course, if all the results belong to a single leaf node, then we should return it ...\n\nThis can be implemented by adding a new ResultMode and a special FacetResultsHandler, which performs the auto-expansion. I think it should be limited to depth=1 only at the moment ...",
