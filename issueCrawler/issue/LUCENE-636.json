    "description": "Currently Lucene can be configured using system properties. When running multiple 'instances' of Lucene for different purposes in the same JVM, it is not possible to use different settings for each 'instance'.\n\nI made changes to some Lucene classes so you can pass a configuration to that class. The Lucene 'instance' will use the settings from that configuration. The changes do not effect the API and/or the current behavior so are backwards compatible.\n\nIn addition to the changes above I also made the SegmentReader and SegmentTermDocs extensible outside of their package. I would appreciate the inclusion of these changes but don't mind creating a separate issue for them.",

This is not a great solution.\n\nA side note...  Tomcat on Ubuntu ships with the security manager turned on by default, a strangely uncommon setting for servlet engine distributions.  The default security settings prevent a webapp from calling System.setProperty(..).\n\nIt would be nice if this got resolved sometime soon because once it is resolved, I need to wait for Compass to pick up the change downstream.  It looks like it may be a year until I don't need to worry about this issue any more. ",
