    "description": "This issue removes the code duplication from Token, as it shares the whole char[] buffer handling code with TermAttributeImpl. This issue removes this duplication by just extending TermAttributeImpl.\n\nWhen the parent issue LUCENE-2302 will extend TermAttribute to support CharSequence and Appendable and also the new BytesRefAttribute gets added, Token will automatically provide this too, so no further code duplication.\n\nThis code should also be committed to trunk, as it has nothing to do with flex.",
