    "description": "SynonymFilter can mix up options from different synonyms, sometimes inserting the wrong word, sometimes using the wrong offset.  Issue appears to be use of the matched arraylist in SynonymFilter\n\nTo reproduce: add \"best buy,bestbuy,bb\" to the example's synonym list.  Then view verbose analysis of the query analyzer output for \"Best buy - Acer Aspire AS5610-2273 - $599. Windows vista, 1 GB RAM\"\n\n\"gigabytes\" becomes a synonym of \"Best buy\", and the offsets of the remainder of the \"GB\" synonyms are incorrect.\n\nAssigning to Yonik as this code is too hairy for me to fix without further study.",
