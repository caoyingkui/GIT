We keep switching back and forth between the different UIs... what makes it worse for us is that for the old UI, we currently get an Exception executing the import (java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException at java.sql.Date.toInstant) which shows up as \"Unknown error\" in the error log...  in the new UI, the import works fine, but we can't check the generated SQL query since the \"Raw Debug-Response\" is empty ...

            "content": "Ok, I begin to see the problem.\n\nThere are four debug things:\n\n\n\tRaw Status-Output which shows the latest status and is always populated. This gets refreshed on Execute, on Refresh and on Auto-Refresh (if enabled)\n\tDebug checkbox that enables Raw Debug-Response section AND adds debug=true flag to the execute POST request. Then - in Execute only - it populates the Raw Debug-Response section. Refresh does nothing to that\n\tDebug-Mode hammer in the Configuration section that allows to edit the configuration right on the screen instead of using the file AND - in the old UI - enables Debug checkbox if not already set\n\tVerbose checkbox that adds an additional section to the debug output if that's enabled.\n\n\n\nIt seems that the Debug checkbox is not actually wired in as the debug=true is never generated. And then, when the execute response is processed, the debug section itself is not populated. And the hammer does not trigger the checkbox either.\n\nThis is mostly complicated due to the multiple debug in the naming conventions. So, it can be fixed without renaming. Or it can be fixed with renaming....  ",
