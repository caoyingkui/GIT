I don't know. If that's where configsets are supposed to be placed, then why does the installer put them somewhere else?\n\nThere's no documented API to tell it to look for config sets anywhere else, either. It will always search inside /var/solr/data.",

By default, the installation script uses /var/solr/data. Take a moment to inspect the contents of the Solr home directory on your system. At a minimum, the home directory will contain a solr.xml file. When Solr starts up, the Solr start script passes the location of the home directory using the -Dsolr.solr.home system property.\n\nBut the installer puts the config sets in the Solr installation directory (/opt/solr), not SOLR_HOME (/var/solr). So something isn't right.\n\n\n\tEITHER Solr should look for config sets where the installer puts them in /opt/solr (or at least have the option to pass in an absolute path).\n\tOR the installer should put config sets in /var/solr, where Solr will actually look for them.\n\tOR installation guide should instruct to copy config sets from Solr install dir to Solr home. (This is the least desirable fix, though, what's the point of an installer if you have to finish the installation manually?)\n\n ",
