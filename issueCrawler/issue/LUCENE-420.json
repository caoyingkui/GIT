I won't have time to look at it in detail or to \ncommit it, but I noticed one small thing: catching exceptions without doing \nanything usually isn't a good idea, even in test cases it at least makes \ndebugging more difficult. I think it's okay to throw exceptions in test cases \nwithout catching them, JUnit should do the right thing and say that the test \nfailed. \n ",
