    "description": "When using WordBreakSolrSpellChecker to break single words into multiple, the collation queries include parenthesis around the original term.  In some cases, this causes required terms to become optional and users get spurious nonsensical collation results.\n\nFor instance, if I search: +eward +smith \n\n...If +ward +smith is a match, it might give a collation like: (+e +ward) +smith\n\n...This requires either the \"e\" or the \"ward\" to exist, but not both.  But users are more likely to want both terms to be required, so it would be better if it was not adding parenthesis.\n\nThis might be the cause of SOLR-5995 and this SO issue",

            "content": "With this patch, parenthesis are still added when the user is using boolean operators.  The change is when the query is based on optional/required clauses.\n\nSo, +pineapple can result in a collation like +pine +apple instead of (+pine +apple) .\n\nOn the other hand, pineapple OR goodness  would still possibly collate to (pine AND apple) OR goodness , same as before.\n\nI will commit this in a few days if there are no objections.
