            "content": "Patch adds MergedDeletesAndUpdates holder class with .init() - this removed the code duplication around the initialization of ReaderAndUpdates and DocMap in all of the branches in the method.\n\nThis allowed to extract a maybeApplyMergedDVUpdates() which removed a lot of other code duplication that existed because of how we initialized those variables before.\n\nIt's a small refactoring, but I will let tests run for a while to make sure eclipse did it right, before I commit .
