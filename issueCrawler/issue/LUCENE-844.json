    "description": "When writing a WeakReference based cache for storing IndexReader objects, I was hit by a NullPointerException thrown from nowhere\n\nThe actual stacktrace I got is:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run(SegmentInfos.java:482)\n        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.open(IndexReader.java:147)\n        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.open(IndexReader.java:142)\n<...>\n\n\nThe culprit  code is in org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos.FindSegmentsFile :\n\n[line 471] \n  if (0 == method) {\n          if (directory != null) \n{\n            files = directory.list();\n          }\n else \n{\n            files = fileDirectory.list();\n          }\n\n          gen = getCurrentSegmentGeneration(files);\n\n          if (gen == -1) {\n            String s = \"\";\n            for(int i=0;i<files.length;i++) \n{ << EXCEPTION THROWN FROM HERE [line 482]\n              s += \" \" + files[i];\n            }\n            throw new FileNotFoundException(\"no segments* file found: files:\" + s);\n          }\n        }\n\nA check on the \"files\" object is required as the fileDirectory.list() can return null.\n\nIn my case, the problem came from the fact that I had no more FileDescriptor available (bug somewhere else in my code) but the NPE was the only info I got...",
