    "description": "Add facet requests which collect associations of a certain category into buckets, and returns each bucket as a facet result node. Association type is either int or float, and there are two methods to define buckets. The first by providing buckets which contain pre-defined ranges. The other is by declaring the required number of buckets, where the ranges of the different buckets are dynamicly set to create balanced bucket sizes.",
