I don't think we would want much more then a simple text area for entering SQL and a table to view the results. We would probably also want a couple of simple widgets to switch between MapReduce and Facets for the SQL aggregations and select the number of workers.\n\nI've already opened a ticket on the Banana site for SQL also.\n\nIn the long term as the JDBC driver fills out we'll have lot's of client options but the admin screen will always be nice thing to have.\n\nErik Hatcher, this also might be a cool thing for /browse to integrate or to implement through the velocity capabilities.

I'd much rather move it towards something that people can use without Solr knowledge, but that can, if they want to, push it deeper. \n\nIf you are game, I'd much rather review where SQL fits into an updated querying UI, and then work on that. SQL should, I'd imagine, just be one syntax used to query, the key user activity being 'querying'.\n\nDoes that sound reasonable? ",
