How should we get quality releases without encouraging users to test things before its officially released?\n\nGetting feedback from users that are willing to deal with trunk and patches, and letting things \"bake\" in trunk is really valuable, and I think its also a step towards encouraging them to participate in development.

And in that case too, it was a single individual that took it upon themselves to add the text you now see (and there certainly was no previous consensus or even discussion on the text added).\n\nTrying to draw sharp lines between developers and users is a lost cause... lucene and solr are for developers themselves and it's one big continuum between user and developer.  Having people use nightly builds is very important for lucene/solr development.  Having a pointer to developer resources from anywhere should be fine.\n\nThe only important point I see is to clearly communicate that a nightly build is not an official ASF release. "
