    "description": "Right now log record serialization is synchronized.  We can improve concurrency by serializing to a ram buffer outside synchronization.  The cost will be RAM usage for buffering, and more complex concurrency in the tlog itself (i.e. we must ensure that a close does not happen without flushing all in-RAM buffers)",

            "content": "Here's a patch that moves log record serialization outside of the synchronized block.\n\nAll tests pass, but I could detect no meaningful speedup on my system.\nAfter further investigation, I believe this is due to the fact that our binary (javabin) serialization is really fast.  I did some profiling and it was between .25% (sampling) and 2% (instrumentation) of the total runtime.  Removing synchronization around such a small percent of time is not going to show up much on my 4 CPU box.\n\nI still plan to commit this as it still represents an architectural improvement, may be more mesurable in high-core systems, and is a stepping stone toward future improvements.
