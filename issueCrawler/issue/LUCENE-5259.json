    "description": "Most of these consumers' exception handling is questionable at best.\n\nif you do it with try-with-resources, then its obvious its correct:\n\ntry (TokenStream stream = analyzer.tokenStream(\"body\", \"testing\")) {\n  stream.reset();\n  while (stream.incrementToken()) {\n    ...\n  }\n  stream.end();\n}\n\n\n\nFor trunk we should change the consumers to work this way. For 4.x we can simulate it with IOUtils",
