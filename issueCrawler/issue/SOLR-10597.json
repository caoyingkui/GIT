    "description": "Somehow, my 5-node Solr cluster got into a state in which each node reported it was going to be the leader and then failed to create /overseer_elect/leader since it was already there.  This generated tons of logs without end.  It's hard to say what other detrimental effect it had but Solr seemed available.  To resolve the problem, I shut the cluster down (except Zookeeper), then brought it back up.\n\nIn case it matters: in Docker/Kontena, host name to IP (DNS) can change frequently.",
