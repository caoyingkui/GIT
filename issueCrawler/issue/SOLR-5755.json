The source collection will continue to have the same data as-is but it will start re-routing write requests to the target collection for the number of seconds specified by the forward.timeout parameter. It is the responsibility of the user to switch to the target collection for reads and writes after the \u2018migrate\u2019 command completes.\n\nThe routing key specified by the \u2018split.key\u2019 parameter may span multiple shards on both the source and the target collections. The migration is performed shard-by-shard in a single thread. One or more temporary collections may be created by this command during the \u2018migrate\u2019 process but they are cleaned up at the end automatically.\n\nThis is a synchronous operation and therefore keeping a large read timeout on the invocation is advised. The request may still timeout due to inherent limitations of the Collection APIs but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the operation has failed. Users should check logs, cluster state, source and target collections before invoking the operation again.\n\nThis command works only with collections having the compositeId router. The target collection must not be receiving any writes during the time the migrate command is running otherwise they some writes may be lost.\n\nPlease note that the migrate API does not perform any deduplication on the documents so if the target collection contains documents with the same uniqueKey as the documents being migrated then the target collection will end up with duplicate documents.\n\nList of parameters and defaults "
