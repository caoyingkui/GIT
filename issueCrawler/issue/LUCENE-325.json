    "description": "We make use the docIDs in lucene. I need a way to compact the docIDs in segments\nto remove the \"holes\" created from doing deletes. The only way to do this is by\ncalling IndexWriter.optimize(). This is a very heavy call, for the cases where\nthe index is large but with very small number of deleted docs, calling optimize\nis not practical.\n\nI need a new method: expungeDeleted(), which finds all the segments that have\ndelete documents and merge only those segments.\n\nI have implemented this method and have discussed with Otis about submitting a\npatch. I don't see where I can attached the patch. I will do according to the\npatch guidleine and email the lucene mailing list.\n\nThanks\n\n-John\n\nI don't see a place where I can",

Could you provide a diff with just the real changes?  \n\nAlso, if you have a unit test that excercises your addition, so we can be sure\nit doesn't break anything, that would be great.  You'd want your unit test to\nmix and match Document additions and deletions and make sure it all still works\nproperly.\nThanks. ",

I'll take it & tentatively mark it 2.4 (hopefully I can make time by then!).\n\nThe original patch would simply merge one segment \"in place\".  I think we can improve this a bit by merging any adjacent series of segments that have deletions?  This would still preserve docID ordering, but would also accomplish some merging as a side effect (I think a good thing). ",

Then, in LogMergePolicy, I\nimplemented this policy: we merge all adjacent segments (up to\nmergeFactor at once) that have deletes.  If only 1 segment has\ndeletes, it's a singular merge. ",
