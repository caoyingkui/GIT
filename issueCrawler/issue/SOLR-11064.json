    "description": "SOLR-11063 added disk space hint to Policy. The ADDREPLICA, MOVEREPLICA, SPLITSHARD and REPLACENODE APIs can provide this hint.\n\n\tADDREPLICA can query the size of the leader's data direcoty for the same shard and pass it to policy\n\tMOVEREPLICA again knows the size of the replica being moved\n\tREPLACENODE can compute the sum of disk usage of all the replicas' data directories\n\n\n\nWe should probably include both index and tlog size in the hint to ensure that we have ample space on target nodes.\n\nWe should also take care of HDFS because for movereplica and replacenode, there are no disk space requirements because the original replica's HDFS data and ulog directories are used by the new replicas.",
