    "description": "This patch implements term boosting for SpanNearQuery. Refer to: http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/62779\n\nThis patch works but probably needs more work. I don't like the use of 'instanceof', but I didn't want to touch Spans or TermSpans. Also, the payload code is mostly a copy of what's in BoostingTermQuery and could be common-sourced somewhere. Feel free to throw darts at it",

The 'needToLoadPayload' flag on the termpos was getting reset on the last term in the span by NearSpansOrdered. Then I noticed that the term positions aren't even needed in BNQ because they were already collected by the Spans in 'matchPayload'. So, here is a newer, simpler implementation of BNQ along with some unit tests.\n\nPeter\n ",
