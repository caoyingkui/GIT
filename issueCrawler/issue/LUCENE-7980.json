    "description": "SOLR-11257\n\nTimothy Potter,\n\nI tried tuning the maxThreadCount for my Concurrent scheduler using:\n\n <mergeScheduler class=\"org.apache.lucene.index.ConcurrentMergeScheduler\">\n          <int name=\"maxThreadCount\">4</int>\n       </mergeScheduler>\n\n\nand got:\nValidation errors:\nError: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: both maxMergeCount and maxThreadCount must be AUTO_DETECT_MERGES_AND_THREADS\nHmmm ... don't know what that means? As I user I need a better error message than that ^ Of course looking at the code, it seems I must also set: maxMergeCount but that error doesn't tell me that. So this bug is about fixing up the error to be more helpful to the user. Of course this is advanced functionality, so maybe expecting me to read the code to understand, in which case, just close this as invalid.",

            "content": "I don't think we should do this, thats more confusing to a lucene user.\n\nThe method is setMaxMergesAndThreads(int maxMergeCount, int maxThreadCount), so you have to pass both maxMergeCount and maxThreadCount to this method, because the java compiler enforces that. So as a java user, this message would just confuse me.\n\nSeems like maybe the problem is really missing validation on the solr side. ",
