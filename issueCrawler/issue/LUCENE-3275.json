    "description": "on the mac, a system update pushed out an upgrade to 1.6.0u26\n\nbasically, if i run 'ant test' from the faceting module, my jre completely hangs (0% cpu, won't even respond to kill -QUIT to print a stacktrace).\nThis is reproducable... it always happens inside SamplingAccumulatorTest.\n\nOf course if i run this test by itself, or anything else, it doesn't want to hang... but you should be able to reproduce by running 'ant test -Dtests.threadspercpu=0' which runs all tests sequentially.\n\nActs like http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2246699\n\nI think this JRE version (update 26) is broken. If your mac asks you to upgrade, just say no.",

If you can post jvm info, os info, and a lucene svn r# that reliable reproduces orcale would have a much better bug report to work with. ",
