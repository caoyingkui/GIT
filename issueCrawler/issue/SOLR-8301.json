    "description": "It looks like we look at all query times when reporting plugins/stats. This includes sub-queries in SolrCloud (i.e. distrib=false).\n\nThis doesn't really give a true picture of what the user sees, i.e. it doesn't really reflect \"the laggard problem\".\n\nTo diagnose a cluster's performance, it seems like it would be useful to aggregate perf stats in two groups at least, the top level (i.e. distrib != false) and distrib=true.\n\nOr perhaps even three, the aggregator times, the distrib=false grouping and actually getting the stored data from the docs to return the client.\n\nThis is always available in the logs, but being able to monitor them with JMX seems useful.",
