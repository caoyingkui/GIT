    "description": "Monospace text doesn't look great in section headings in the PDF - the font color is different and the size is smaller. With the old way of generating the PDF we could make it the same color & adjust the font size so it was less jarring. We don't have that option now, so the difference is much more pronounced.\n\nI found 148 instances of this in 40 files. I think we can make that \"normal\" text without losing any important information for the reader.\n\nAttaching screenshots of what it used to look like and what it now looks like, to illustrate the difference.",

I wonder about the inconsistency about using italics in headings and monospace in text - perhaps it's fine, though. I could see  the same argument about removing the monospace from headings - it's inconsistent. But, in the case of the monospace, the effect turns out to be more jarring than useful. The goal is to convey information to the reader without causing unnecessary interruption in the flow of their reading. Italics would flow with the text.\n\nProbably 80% or more of the usages are in regard to parameters, and like the example I showed, the heading clearly states the section is about \"The start Parameter\", \"The fq Parameter\", \"The facet.query Parameter\", etc. Does differentiating the text style for the name of the parameter help the reader without interrupting his/her reading? I'm open to being convinced about that, but I'm not yet.\n\nI'm not a fan of using quotes, since I think we already use them very inconsistently - for example, sometimes when we refer to the techproducts example we put \"techproducts\" in monospace, but sometimes it's in single quotes, and sometimes it's double quotes, and other times it's a combo of these.

These  also wouldn't benefit much from highlighting.\n\nLooking at the remaining 57 (30%), I don't see any that would be irreparably harmed by removing all highlighting.  In some cases, using italics for symbols (e.g. !, ||, +, -, &&) might actual make them look worse.\n\nOn balance, I guess I'm +1 to removing all highlighting (rather than substituting e.g. italics).

In part:\n\n\nAll the major style guides (Chicago, New York) explicitly advise against the use of the underline, labeling it as legacy, and the HTML5 specification discourage its use in normal text to avoid confusion with hyperlinks. Text should be emphasized using italics (preferred), bold (used sparingly) or an alternative styling that is still accessible.\n\nI agree, and I withdraw my preference for underscores (if any highlighting ends up being used).
