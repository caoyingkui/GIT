    "description": "GeoRelationutils uses a basic algebraic approach for computing if (and where) a rectangle crosses a polygon by checking the line segments of both the polygon and rectangle. The current suboptimal line crossing approach can be greatly improved by exploiting the orientation of the lines and endpoints. If the endpoints of one line are on different \"sides\" of the line segment then  the two may cross.",
