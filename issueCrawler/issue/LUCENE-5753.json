    "description": "uax_url_email analyzer appears unable to recognize the \".local\" TLD among others. Bug can be reproduced by\n\ncurl -XGET \"ADDRESS/INDEX/_analyze?text=First%20Last%20lname@section.mycorp.local&pretty&analyzer=uax_url_email\"\n\nwill parse \"lname@section.my\" and \"corp.local\" as separate tokens, as opposed to\n\ncurl -XGET \"ADDRESS/INDEX/_analyze?text=First%20Last%20lname@section.mycorp.org&pretty&analyzer=uax_url_email\"\n\nwhich will recognize \"lname@section.mycorp.org\".\n\nCan this be fixed by updating to a newer version? I am running ElasticSearch 0.90.5 and whatever Lucene version sits underneath that. My suspicion is that the TLD list the analyzer relies on (http://www.internic.net/zones/root.zone, I think?) is incomplete and needs updating.",

(-Xmx4g didn't work, but maybe something between 4g and 8g would - I didn't try.)\n\nWith this patch, the lucene-analyzers-common jar goes from 1.5MB to 1.6MB; I think the size increase is acceptable.\n\nCommitting shortly.
