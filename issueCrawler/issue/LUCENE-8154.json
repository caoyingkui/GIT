    "description": "This issue is just a placeholder to record stuff that needs to be done when we upgrade to Java 9 as minimum requirement for running Lucene/Solr:\n\n\n\tRemove FutureArrays and FutureObjects from source tree and change code to use Java 9 native methods. Disable MR-JAR building (maybe only disable so we can reuse at later stages)\n\tRemove Java 8 bytebuffer unmapping code\n\n\n\nFinal stuff:\n\n\tWhen upgrading to Java 9, don't delete the Java 9 specific stuff for Multi-Release testing from build files or smoke tester! Keep it alive, maybe migrate to later Java (e.g. LTS-Java)",
