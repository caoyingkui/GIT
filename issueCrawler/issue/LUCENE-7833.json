    "description": "We recently upgraded our Elasticsearch cluster from 5.3 to 5.4 and found a bug when we score nested documents.\n\nI spent some time to check the code from Elasticsearch and Lucene and I found a problem in ToParentBlockJoinQuery.BlockJoinScorer.setScoreAndFreq.\n\nIn the switch statement for the scoreMode in the case \"Max\" the function Math.min is used and I guess it should be Math.max.\n\nThis would explain our problem in Elasticsearch because we see exactly the problem that instead of the maximum the minimum is returned.",
