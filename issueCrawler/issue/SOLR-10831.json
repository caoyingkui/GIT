Also update replicationFactor to indicate the default type.\n\tupdate Collections API ADDREPLICA command doc for new param type.\n\tSome sort of explanation <<somewhere>> on best practices for when to use which types and caveats or limitations when using them.\n\n\n\nDoes that sound right?

I realized there was already a section describing leaders already, so I expanded it a bit for this purpose and didn't need to add a new page.\n\nIt's been a long time since I thought about this feature, so I've forgotten some of the details, particularly around mixing the replica types. I'd like to explain what happens in each type (and point out if one is not recommended), but the notes in SOLR-10233 were a little bit over my head. IOW, I need some help on that front.\n\nThe patch also has the updates for parameters used with CREATE and ADDREPLICA. ",
