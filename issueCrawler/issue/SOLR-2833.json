The second step is the update request processor (SOLR-2073) that stores geonames dumps as documents in the index. Then, we can query based on the spatial q parser (SOLR-2075). This lets you do queries like:\n\n\n   {!spatial ct=[city] s=[state] c=[country] d=[search radius]}search text\n   e.g. {!spatial ct=Orlando s=FL c=US d=400}NASA\n\n\n\n(which in our example looked up articles about NASA and JPL stories within\n400 km (or miles) of Orlando, FL in the US).\n\nYou can find the full documentation here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chrismattmann/solrcene\n "

Comments?\n\nCool yah, that's a good idea. The thing is, the easiest way for us was just to take geonames dumps (text files which we have on a bunch of our projects) and then as a first step index them in Solr creating our \"geonames-aware\" index. Then, this can be used during qparsing to allow those types of queries. I didn't want to go live to geonames.org b/c the site bandwidth might be an issue, and sometimes also we're working behind firewalls and stuff. "
