            "content": "Hi Doron and Otis,\n\nMy view is that this bug is a problem in FuzzyQuery, not in PriorityQueue or BooleanQuery. It is the caller's duty to create a priority queue with a sensible size, and it's not BooleanQuery's fault that other classes are using its getMaxClauseCount() wrongly. Moreover, changing PriorityQueue or BooleanQuery in the way Doron did, might potentially have side-effects because they are used in many places in Lucene. How do we know that nowhere in Lucene will we ever need a priority queue with a million elements?\n\nTherefore I suggest a different patch, changing only FuzzyQuery. \n\nhe idea in the patch I'm attaching is that while FuzzyQuery is allowed to create BooleanQuery.getMaxClauseCount() clauses, it doesn't have to do so, and doesn't need to create a priority queue of that size when this number is huge. I added to FuzzyQuery its own maxClauseCount (with per-instance getter/setter methods)  and FuzzyQuery will never try to create more than this number of clauses, even if Boolean.getMaxClauseCount() is huge.\n\nI set FuzzyQuery's default maxClauseCount to 1024, for backward compatibility (this is what happens today when you use BooleanQuery's defaults). However, it is likely that a user will want to set this number much lower than that. In fact, the whole idea of the priority queue is that it may be enough to take only a small number the most similar terms, so setting a FuzzyQuery's maxClauseCount to 100 or even 10 makes sense to me. This new feature is an added benefit of my patch.\n\nMy patch also includes Javadoc changes describing the new feature, and a new test case that failed before the fix, and succeeds after this patch.

I agree with Nadav, the problem is with the Queries that use MaxClauses to build the priority queue - its just not good use of the queue.\n\nI also agree with Doron that its really two distinct issues though:\n\n1. FuzzyQuery et al should be using lazy allocation of some kind. It makes no sense to create an array that large for every multi term query, especially when we direct users to possibly use Integer.MAX_VALUE.\n\n2.  The FAQ should not say to use Integer.MAX_VALUE if its going to kak with FuzzyQuery. At a minimum, FuzzyQuery should not init the priority queue larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE-1.\n\nI suppose, that almost combines the 2 issues though - we are telling users to set the max clauses to a number that will force ridiculously wasteful memory allocation. Almost seems like both issues really need to be addressed together. Or maybe just the FAQ changed  ",

I'm especially worried about the slowdown by the fact that adding a small element (below the current heap's head) in our code just does one comparison and returns, but in the usage I described above it actually modifies the heap twice (adds the element to the heap and then removes it).

And we do not need the upper limit here, like you propsed.\n\nI will prepare a patch tomorrow in the ApacheCon hacking session.\n\nEDIT\n\nWe need the upper limit here, but we can implement it like you proposed.
