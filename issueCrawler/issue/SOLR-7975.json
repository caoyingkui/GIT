    "description": "Currently payloads are supported through the use of an analysis chain, this limits the ability to provide payloads on primitive fields like Trie, Bool, etc without copying these classes and adding the ability in custom code.  It would be great if payloads could be added to these field types in a pluggable way similar to what is supported for non primitive types, perhaps through extending the base primitive implementations.",

With SOLR-1485, you can attach payloads and use them for numeric retrieval/weighting or PayloadCheckQuery matching - but it requires the right Query types to be used to leverage payload in scoring - what kinds of queries are you needing and what effect would payloads have on those queries? (are there Lucene query types already that satisfy your needs here?) ",
