    "description": "Solr scripts for cloud example break if called from a directory other than $SOLR_HOME, ie $PWD is not $SOLR_HOME: It always strips off the beginning of the path. This used to work regardless in Solr 4.x as I used to use it quite a lot and my custom solr 4.x docker containers it still works regardless of $PWD - it's only broken in 5x/6.0.\n\nHere is an example of the issue:\n\ndocker run -ti solr bash\nsolr@5083b8e59d49:/opt/solr$ cd /\nsolr@5083b8e59d49:/$ solr -e cloud\n\nWelcome to the SolrCloud example!\n\nThis interactive session will help you launch a SolrCloud cluster on your local workstation.\nTo begin, how many Solr nodes would you like to run in your local cluster? (specify 1-4 nodes) [2]: \n\nOk, let's start up 2 Solr nodes for your example SolrCloud cluster.\nPlease enter the port for node1 [8983]: \n\nPlease enter the port for node2 [7574]: \n\nCreating Solr home directory /opt/solr/example/cloud/node1/solr\nCloning /opt/solr/example/cloud/node1 into\n   /opt/solr/example/cloud/node2\n\nStarting up Solr on port 8983 using command:\n/opt/solr/bin/solr start -cloud -p 8983 -s \"pt/solr/example/cloud/node1/solr\"\n\nSolr home directory pt/solr/example/cloud/node1/solr not found!\n\nERROR: Process exited with an error: 1 (Exit value: 1)",
