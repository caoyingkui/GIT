    "description": "Another bug found during SOLR-9438. I saw that shard split requests were being retried more times than the attempts made by the test. I traced it to LBHttpSolrClient which retries automatically on 404 or 403 or 503 or 500 errors except when the request is an update.\n\nEach admin request is retried on failure as many times as the number of live nodes.",
