Had heard about issues with stray files lying around with this new layout on the list, so I started with a fresh checkout.\n\nDid:\n\n\n$ cd solr\n$ ant dist\n...\n$ ant example\n...\n$ bin/solr start\nWaiting to see Solr listening on port 8983bin/solr: line 1037: /home/ramk/projects/lucene-solr/solr/server/logs/solr-8983-console.log: No such file or directory\n\n\n\nwaits for a minute, then exits with failure..\n\nafter a bit of digging, realized that doing a mkdir server/logs does the trick. Should this be done by the script itself with a mkdir -p server/logs?\n\nAlso, looks like ant example is still needed, is this a bit of a misnomer now that we have gone away from the example name? ",
