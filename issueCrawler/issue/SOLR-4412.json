    "description": "For some languages, the detector will detect sub-languages, such as LangDetect detecting zh-tw or zh-cn for Chinese. Tika detector only detects zh. Today you can use lcmap to map these two into one code, e.g. langid.map.lcmap=zh-cn:zh zh-tw:zh. But the langField\u00a0output is not changed.\n\nWe need an option for langField as well.",
