    "description": "Spinoff from this thread:\n\n  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/55951\n\nThere are actually 2 separate cases here, both only happening when\nautoCommit=false:\n\n\n\tFirst issue was caused by LUCENE-843 (sigh): if you add a bunch of\n    docs with no term vectors, such that 1 or more flushes happen;\n    then you add docs that do have term vectors, the tvx file will not\n    have enough entries (= corruption).\n\n\n\n\n\tSecond issue was caused by bulk merging of term vectors\n    (LUCENE-1120 \u2013 only in trunk) and bulk merging of stored fields\n    (LUCENE-1043, in 2.3), and only shows when autoCommit=false, and,\n    the bulk merging optimization runs.  In this case, the code that\n    reads the rawDocs tries to read too far in the tvx/fdx files (it's\n    not really index corruption but rather a bug in the rawDocs\n    reading).",
