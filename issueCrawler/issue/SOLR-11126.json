Can you add a v2 equivalent for this handler?\n\tCan't we use this for non-cloud cases as well? Perhaps add a param (cloud=true?) to signal that the response should be OK only when running in cloud mode\n\tIf we do the above, we can add a param for core and then deprecate the PingRequestHandler and eventually remove it.\n\n ",

I think we should be able to support both off the same handler, but I would want to give it more thought instead of just moving the code for standalone mode here.\n\nDid you intend to just get the PING handler to work for standalone mode, without deprecating ? If so, that's rather simple, but as I mentioned earlier, I'd want to give it a little more thought. Feel free to chime in if you think I didn't understand you well. ",
