We removed support for TermEnum (without s), so field name is never null. You can always take the field from the MTQ when building TermQueries. And for that we create the Term using new Term(field, BytesRef) or with the non-interning placeholder (see also below).

But it no longer clones it e.g. if the term is never accepted by the PQ. Also the PQ reuses its ScoreTerm instances and so, the term bytes are simply copied over \n\nI also removed a Java 1.6 interface override - the Generics Policeman gives a ticket!
