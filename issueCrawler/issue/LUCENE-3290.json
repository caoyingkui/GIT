    "description": "For scoring systems like lnu.ltc (http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec16/papers/ibm-haifa.mq.final.pdf), we need to supply 3 stats:\n\n\taverage tf within d\n\t# of unique terms within d\n\taverage number of unique terms across field\n\n\n\nIf we add FieldInvertState.numUniqueTerms, you can incorporate the first two into your norms/docvalues (once we cut over),\nthe average tf within d being length / numUniqueTerms.\n\nto compute the average across the field, we can just write the sum of all terms' docfreqs into the terms dictionary header,\nand you can then divide this by maxdoc to get the average.",
