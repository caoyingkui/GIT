I reworked it a fair amount rather than just do a straight Heliosearch backport (since in some of my Helio work the goal was to minimize merge conflicts).\n\n\n\trewrote StandardRequestParser.parseParamsAndFillStreams() for clarity (the big \"if\" in the previous version was pretty confusion), and commented what I've figured out along the way.\n\timproved the pattern matching for \"restlet paths\" /config and /schema\nso something like a core name of \"schema_free\" wouldn't accidentally cause a match.\n\tform data from curl now autodetects JSON & XML\n\tStringStream now allows the specification of a content type and only tries to auto-detect if not given.  It also only auto-detects once and remembers it.\n\ttried to make those easymock based tests a little less fragile\n\n\n\nAside: I discovered that SOLR-6787 changed the behavior of a POST without content type.  Previously it would throw an exception, but now it will use the raw request parser.  Not sure if that was on purpose or not. ",
