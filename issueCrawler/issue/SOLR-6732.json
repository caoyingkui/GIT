    "description": "We changed the LIR state to be kept as a map but it is not back-compatible. The problem is that we're checking for map or string after parsing JSON but if the key has \"down\" as a string then json parsing will fail.\n\nThis was introduced in SOLR-6511. This error will prevent anyone from upgrading to 4.10.2\n\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201411.mbox/%3C54636ED2.8040508@cytainment.de%3E",

            "content": "Here's an updated patch that should allow for hot, rolling upgrades - handling the String state or JSON map correctly. I've added a unit test that checks for back-compat support.\n\nThe other concern is a node running old code that expects a String state and not the JSON map. I think that will not cause any issues since it will just treat the map as a String; a recovering replica will just delete the value once it's active. \n\nHowever, before I commit this I'll do a rolling upgrade to ensure no issues when going from 4.8.x to 4.10.3 ",
