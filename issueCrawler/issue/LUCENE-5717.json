            "content": "First patch attached. At this time there's no generic way to retrieve sub-queries from compound queries, thus I could only add two more ifs to the existing extractAutomata method. Maybe it's worth discussing if there's a way to make this more generic in a separate issue. Also not sure if there are others compound queries that I missed. ",
