            "content": "I would guess that the start parameter should handle the top level, and what you get is a cursor at the top level. This semantic parallels grouping queries (though I haven't checked how cursors work there!). It sounds like the goal is to alleviate deep paging. Controlling total return size in the event of many child docs is perhaps a related problem, but maybe that doesn't have to be solved at the same time. I haven't looked at how this transformer works, but if the top level is fetched first and subsequent levels flushed out from there, a cursor on the top level\u00a0sounds like it might keep that initial fetch small.
