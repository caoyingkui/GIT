    "description": "There is really no reason why spell check has to be done through a separate index. In most cases the spell check index is built from a Solr field. With a few configured dynamic fields, an UpdateRequestProcessor and a SearchComponent, spell checking can be done from the main Solr index.\n\nThis eliminates the spellcheck build phases and spellcheck can get to use the Java replication for free.",
