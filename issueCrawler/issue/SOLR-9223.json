    "description": "We ended up with a leaderless shard in the following scenario\n\n1) Add a new replica to a shard\n2) while the node is still recovering do indexing\n3) Delete the replica that is the leader of the shard\nIt's likely that the latest update(s) is only sent to the node that is recovering. Other nodes try to become the leader but they can't because they don't have the latest updates. The node that has the latest updates is trying to recover. And we end up in a situation where the shard does not have a leader.\n\nHow do we resolve this problem?  Any suggestions Mark Miller",
