I did the same thing for SegmentDocsAndPositions[AndPayloads]Enum removing a couple of hundred lines of code abstracting it into a base class. patch follows in a sec...",

For most cases, the number of deletes are small and furthermore, but moving the delete check to the searcher, we handle this case implicitly while making sure the number of checks into liveDocs is <= the sum of the number of checks needed in each leaf node.

For heavy queries this could be problematic ie phrases would check way more docs than needed if the live docs is very sparse. I think we should have it in both places but making it optional where to do it is an interesting idea. Depending on the cardinality we could do the checks in the IndexSearcher or rather in the top level collect method or in the Collector.  ",
