The thread pool size can default to the number of\nprocessors.\n\n\n\n\n\tWe can optimize usage of readers where small segments are\nsearched sequentially, larger segments are searched on in\nparallel\n\n\n\n\n\tNeed a plan for how Collector.setNextReader works when\nparallelized (i.e. where do we add synchronization without\ncreating a bottleneck?)",
