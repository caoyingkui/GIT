    "description": "If a field name contains non-ascii characters in a 2.3.x index, then\non upgrade to 2.4.x unexpected problems are hit.  It's possible to hit\na \"read past EOF\" IOException; it's also possible to not hit an\nexception but get an incorrect field name.\n\nThis was caused by LUCENE-510, because the FieldInfos (*.fnm) file is\nnot properly versioned.\n\nSpinoff from http://www.nabble.com/Read-past-EOF-td23276171.html",
