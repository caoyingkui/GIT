    "description": "It would be very useful for debugging if IndexReader either had a getName() method, or a toString() implementation that would get a string identification for the reader.\n\nfor SegmentReader, this would return the same as getSegmentName()\nfor Directory readers, this would return the \"generation id\"?\nfor MultiReader, this could return something like \"multi(sub reader name, sub reader name, sub reader name, ...)\n\nright now, i have to check instanceof for SegmentReader, then call getSegmentName(), and for all other IndexReader types, i would have to do something like get the IndexCommit and get the generation off it (and this may throw UnsupportedOperationException, at which point i have would have to recursively walk sub readers and try again)\n\nI could work up a patch if others like this idea",
