            "content": "Thank you Igor, I think this is a very bad bug!\n\nYour fix looks good but I think there is still an issue given that offsets are not used for the equality test. So (the very unlikely yet possible case of having) two filters that have the same fields, same number of terms, same hash code and same term bytes but different offsets would still be considered equal.\n\nI think we should try to make this equals method easier to read in order not to have similar issues in the future: maybe a start could be try to replace the comparison of the termsAndFields array and the termBytes array with a call to Arrays.equals.
