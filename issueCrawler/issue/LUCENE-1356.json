    "description": "TopDocCollector's members and constructor are declared either private or package visible. It makes it hard to extend it as if you want to extend it you can reuse its hq and totatlHits members, but need to define your own. It also forces you to override getTotalHits() and topDocs().\nBy changing its members and constructor (the one that accepts a PQ) to protected, we allow users to extend it in order to get a different view of 'top docs' (like TopFieldCollector does), but still enjoy its getTotalHits() and topDocs() method implementations.",

Others? ",

            "content": "IMO, TopFieldDocCollector should be changed to use reusableSD. FieldDoc extends ScoreDoc. That's the reason I modified it to protected - for extensions of TopDocCollector who maintain in PQ ScoreDoc types (either ScoreDoc or extensions).\nI don't see any advantage in marking it private, nor any disadvantage if any extension to TopDocCollector will maintain its own ScoreDoc instance.\nIt's just that we have TopDocCollector, TopFieldDocCollector and my extension to TDC which insert ScoreDoc instances into PQ, so it made sense to me to change it to protected.

            "content": "Re-thinking this - resuableSD should remain private to both TDC and TFDC. The reason is the two classes use it differently and don't share any implementation which involves this member (unlike totalHits and hq).\n\nI was in the middle of adding javadoc to the protected members and constructor (which accepts numHits and PQ) when I noticed that numHits is completely ignored by this constructor --> TopDocCollector(int numHits, PriortityQueue hq).\nThe reason is that PQ is be probably configured to hold a maximum number of hits.\n\nWhat bothers me with this constructor is that it may falsely lead users of the API to think that it limits their PQ with a maximum number of hits. I think we should remove that parameter and expose two constructors:\npublic TopDocCollector(int numHits) AND public TopDocCollector(PriorityQueue hq).\n\nIf you agree, I'll reflect that in the 2nd patch I want to create (which adds javadoc).
