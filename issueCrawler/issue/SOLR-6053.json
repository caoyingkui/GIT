            "content": "Trying to read between the lines (because as Ahmet has noted, you haven't really given us anything to go on)...\n\nIf you have a sharded index and the numFound changes when you run the same query more than once, then it is likely that you have documents with the same uniqueKey field value in more than one shard.  Solr assumes that every document across all shards has a unique value in the uniqueKey field.  If this is not the case, then Solr cannot guarantee correct results.\n\nSolr is smart enough to eliminate duplicates from any results that are returned, but in order for that to happen across the whole index, every document must be considered \u2013 which is why it works properly when rows is larger than numFound.\n\nThis should have been brought up on the solr-user mailing list, not as an issue in Jira.\n\nhttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/discussion.html\n\nClosing as Not a Problem.  If further investigation via regular support avenues (like the mailing list or the IRC channel) reveals that there is a bug, we can reopen. "
