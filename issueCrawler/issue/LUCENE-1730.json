    "description": "TrecContentSource opens InputStreamReader w/o a fixed encoding. On Windows, this means CP1252 (at least on my machine) which is ok. However, when I opened it on a Linux machine w/ a default of UTF-8, it failed to read the files. The patch changes it to use ISO-8859-1, which seems to be the right one (and http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/man/manual/ch01s04.html mentions this encoding in its example of a script which reads the data).\n\nPatch to follow shortly.",

Or that someone else has created trec compatible data in another encoding? Or trec has data in different encodings? If something reads a source of files, and the files could technically be in any encoding, I would expect things to be configurable so that I can specify what encoding the files are in. It just seems like a good standard feature with something that reads what are essentially pluggable files. The format is going to be consistent, but why would the encoding necessarily be consistent?
