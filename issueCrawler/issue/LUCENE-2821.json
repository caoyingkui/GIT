            "content": "Robert, are you sure we can apply the patch to 3x? I'm asking because it breaks back-compat. Few protected fields are removed and the Map's signature is changed from Map<Integer,FilterItem> to Map<Integer,Filter>. I doubt that anyone extends it, but perhaps someone's using it in a way that it will now break. Given that we deprecated it and removed in trunk, do you think it's worth the break? ",
