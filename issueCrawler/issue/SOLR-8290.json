            "content": "Some historical context for when/why this param was added in SOLR-2348...\n\nwith that in mind, i think for now the most straight forward thing to do is to add a \"checkFieldCacheSource(QParser)\" method to SchemaField that would be cut/paste of checkSortability (with the error message wording changed) and make all of the (applicable) FieldType.getValueSource methods call it. In the future, it could evolve differently then checkSortability \u2013 either removing the \"!multivalued\" assertion completley, or introspecting the Qparser context in some way to determine that neccessary info has been provided to know how to use the (hypothetical) multivalued FieldCache (hard t ospeculate at this point)\n\n...since it evidently hasn't proved useful since then, no objections to removing now (although i'm not sure what downside there was to leaving it in either) ",

            "content": "Thanks for the historical context info. Motivation for the removal is that checkFieldCacheSource not using QParser and potentially SOLR-8305 replacing (ExternalFileField|LatLonType).getValueSource's QParser use then potentially FieldType.getRangeQuery need no longer take a QParser argument (several places are already passing null as the QParser argument for getRangeQuery).
