    "description": "I have looked around on your web site as well as some documentation but have not found anything to do with Concept Search.\n\nMy definition of Concept Search is as follows:\n1.  I would have a file (list) of various phrases / N-grams which I would like to Lucene to use as a search basis without having to type in all these phrases manually, and have Lucene return the results as it would normally if a single search query was entered.\n2.  An example would be - find Unable to render embedded object: File (Wild_Animals) not found. - where the \"!\" would indicate that this is a search that would use a file (ie Wild_Animals.txt) and read in the various phrases within this file and perform the search in the corpus for these phrases.\n3.  The contents of Wild_Animals.txt could look like this:\nBUFFALO\nBEAR\nMOOSE\nCOYOTE\nWOLF\nMOUNTAIN GOAT\nMOUNTAIN SHEEP\nDALL SHEEP\nDEER\nKODIAK BEAR\nBROWN BEAR\nBLACK BEAR\netc etc etc\n\n4.  Is my idea of a Concept Search feasible / doable???  If so, can you point me to any documentation that exists whereby this could be done within Lucene\n\nPlease send any info you have on this to me - Charles_S_Patridge@prodigy.net\n\nThank you in advance for your time and efforts.",
