    "description": "Right now, a Solr node will return the results of a search request even if it cannot communicate with ZooKeeper at the time it receives the request. This may result in stale or incorrect results if there have been major changes to the collection structure that the node has not been informed of via ZooKeeper.  When this happens, as long as all known shards respond, the response will succeed, and a zkConnected header set to false is included in the search response.\n\nThere should be an option to instead fail requests under these conditions, to prevent stale or incorrect results.",

            "content": "Attached patch implements the idea.\n\nRather than introducing a new request param, I've expanded the possible values shards.tolerant\u00a0can take on to include non-boolean value requireZkConnected, which enables the mode described above. \u00a0(Thanks to Hoss Man for his offline suggestion to use shards.tolerant\u00a0for this purpose.)\u00a0\n\nIn addition to causing requests to fail when the coordinating node can't communicate with ZooKeeper, setting shards.tolerant to requireZkConnected will cause search components to behave the same as when shards.tolerant is set to false (the default): the request will fail rather than causing partial results to be returned.\n\nI've included ref guide docs and a CHANGES entry.\u00a0Precommit and all Solr tests pass.\u00a0I think this is ready to go.\n\nFeedback is welcome.

It's my understanding that SolrCloud goes read-only when ZK quorum is lost, so it would have to be a particularly unusual network partition for the described situation to arise.

Solr already handles these conditions, as mentioned in the description, via the zkConnected header.  This issue just enables callers to get a failure response instead of having to conditionally handle responses based on the value of the zkConnected header. ",
