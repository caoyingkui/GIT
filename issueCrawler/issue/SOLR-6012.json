    "description": "I am trying to search a word in dutch language with the word Brievenbussen. Normally this is the proper dutch word and it should result in some matches but it results in 0 matches. The dutch word Brievenbusen (Letter 's' is removed) returns matches.\n\nThe problem is it doesn't take the last word 'bus' vowel character into account. If a vowel is found in the last before character (in this case, it is 'U'), then the proper dutch word should be Brievenbussen.\n\nCan you please confirm if this is a problem with 3.5 version.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information.",
