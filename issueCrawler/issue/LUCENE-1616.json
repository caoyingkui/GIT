They don't provide incremental construction (i.e. add() method, like in BooleanQuery), and they can be built only from an array of subqueries. So, if you don't know exact amount of subqueries upfront, you're busted. You have to use ArrayList, which you convert to array to feed into SpanQuery, which is converted back to ArrayList inside!!\n2. They can't be edited. If you have a need to iterate over your query tree and modify it in one way or another, you need to create brand new instances of Span*Query. And here you hit #1 again, hard.\n3. They can't be even inspected without creating a new array from the backing list (see getClauses).\n\nI use patched versions of SpanNear/OrQueries, which still use backing ArrayList, but accept it in constructor, have utility 'add' method and getClauses() returns this very list, which allows for zero-cost inspection and easy modification if the need arises.
