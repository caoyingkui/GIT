    "description": "Talking to a user on IRC, I've come across some things we could do better in our startup scripts and the documentation around them.\n\n\n\tIt's very difficult to make the entire install directory read-only from the point of view of the RUNAS user.\n\t\n\t\tThe war must be extracted, by default this is done to server/solr-webapp.\n\t\tFixing this will require a few changes to the scripts as well as some additions to the documentation.  I'm not suggesting that we make this a default setup, just provide information on how a user can accomplish it.\n\t\n\t\n\tIf SOLR_ENV is pointed at a script that is empty, nonexistent, or only includes minimal user settings, the settings for default max heap and GC tuning are lost, and return to undesirable Java defaults.  I believe that a user env file should supplement solr.in.\n{sh,cmd}\n, not replace it.  The user can always completely override the provided defaults in their env file.\n\n\n\nThere were some other ideas I had, will update if I remember them.",
