    "description": "We've created an optimized copy of files from Directory to Directory. We've also optimized copyBytes recently. However, we're missing the opposite side of the copy - from IndexInput to Output. I'd like to mimic the FileChannel API by having copyTo on IndexInput and copyFrom on IndexOutput. That way, both sides can optimize the copy process, depending on the type of the IndexInput/Output that they need to copy to/from.\n\nFSIndexInput/Output can use FileChannel if the two are FS types. RAMInput/OutputStream can copy to/from the buffers directly, w/o going through intermediate ones. Actually, for RAMIn/Out this might be a big win, because it doesn't care about the type of IndexInput/Output given - it just needs to copy to its buffer directly.\n\nIf we do this, I think we can consolidate all Dir.copy() impls down to one (in Directory), and rely on the In/Out ones to do the optimized copy. Plus, it will enable someone to do optimized copies between In/Out outside the scope of Directory.\n\nIf this somehow turns out to be impossible, or won't make sense, then I'd like to optimize RAMDirectory.copy(Dir, src, dest) to not use an intermediate buffer.",

I've disabled everything else (IndexInput.copyBytes). It's as if this call copies bytes that should not have been copied. I've added this change because I thought there is a bug in the current copyBytes impl: it uses FileChannel to do the optimized copy, but since SimpleFSIndexInput extends BufferedIndexInput, there might be bytes read to its buffer, and not written yet ...\n\nI've made the following changes:\nFSIndexOutput.copyBytes:\n\n      SimpleFSIndexInput fsInput = (SimpleFSIndexInput) input;\n\n// change start\n//      // flush any bytes in the input's buffer.\n//      numBytes -= fsInput.flushBuffer(this, numBytes);\n      \n      // flush any bytes in our buffer\n      flush();\n// change end\n\n      // do the optimized copy\n      FileChannel in = fsInput.file.getChannel();\n\n\n\nand rewrote BufferedIndexInput.flushBuffer:\n\n\n    int toCopy = bufferLength - bufferPosition;\n    if (toCopy < numBytes) {\n      // We're copying the entire content of the buffer, so update accordingly.\n      out.writeBytes(buffer, bufferPosition, toCopy);\n      bufferPosition = bufferLength = 0;\n      bufferStart += toCopy;\n    } else {\n      toCopy = (int) numBytes;\n      // We are asked to copy less bytes than are available in the buffer.\n      out.writeBytes(buffer, bufferPosition, toCopy);\n      bufferPosition += toCopy;\n    }\n    return toCopy;\n\n\n\nThe test now fails on some other exception (not the assert in addRawDocuments).
