That seems less than ideal...I wonder if we could just design the solr.xml from the ground up - as if it was a properties file. I have not donated any sweat to this yet, so just an idea, but I think we can do better than the current solr.xml - <cores>. "

            "content": "That reminds me that I did just that in SOLR-3613 - refactored solr.xml into a better structure for the cloud params. But it was never completed due to arguments about not wanting to namespace cloud java-options for the 4.0.0 release due to back-compat with beta.\n\nI just uploaded my work to that patch, it won't apply to today's trunk, but have a look at the proposed solr.xml format. The patch tries to prefix all params such as zkHost with a solr. prefix, but still keep the short form as a valid alias. But then I got somewhat lost trying to also support webapp-name. prefixing automatically... "

            "content": "I had a long plane ride so I cut solr.properties out in the attached patch. All tests pass, although I haven't yet really gone over it yet, consider this preliminary.\n\nKnown tasks not yet done:\n1> add tests for persisting the new property.\n2> there are a couple of JIRAs (SOLR-4631 and SOLR-4632) that I have yet to incorporate.\n\nThere is a new attribute for <cores>, autoDiscoverCores=[\"true\"|\"false\"], defaults presently to \"false\". If you'd like a different name, speak now...\n\nI left the interface definition in place, currently only ConfigSolrXml implements it (renamed from ConfigSolrXmlBackCompat). My theory is that since it's there already, leaving it in has the advantage of allowing easier implementation of a pluggable configuration provider of some kind should the desire arise. One possibility (although I know nothing about whether it's desirable) would be provide all this info from ZK directly, maybe based on a sysprop? \n\nI also renamed several files, removed the supporting config fies for solr.properties etc., so be aware that some things have moved around...\n\nI plan to commit this in the next couple of days to both trunk and 4x on the theory that the faster I take solr.properties out of code anyone can get to, the less they'll be inconvenienced by flip-flopping.\n\nChanging this didn't require any changes to the tricky bits around coordinating core load/unload/reload code, so it's not a radical change. Not to say I necessarily did it right, but it's not nearly as scary as the rest of the changes for SOLR-4196.\n\nAll comments welcome.... "

Rather, we should just determine if it's an old solr.xml or a new one (add a version, change the format, change the file name, something - I'll have to dig in first to know what I would vote for).\n\nGiven that, I also still think we should change the solr.xml format to make more sense. I'll be pitching in on this soon (I've said that for a while, but I keep getting caught up in other things - I will be doing this before 4.3 though.) "
