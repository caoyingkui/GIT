Therefore, if you had a personal fork, you will find\nthat it has changed its \"origin remote\", and you will have to re-add the\nApache repo as your origin, and then rebase your changes. Instructions \n[here](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Git%20commit%20process).\n\nIf you had active Pull Requests against our GitHub mirror, these are unfortunately\ngone, but not lost. Please create a new PR against the new mirror or send an email \nto the [dev-list](mailto:dev@lucene.apache.org) to ask for details of your old one.\n\nThe PMC is happy to answer any question you may have regarding this change.\n\n\n\nWe should add a short instruction to the Wiki page about how to add back our official mirror as origin, as well as rebase your fork onto the the new repo.
