    "description": "I just upgraded to Solr 4.2 and cannot explain the following behaviour:\n\nI am using a solr.TrieDoubleField named 'ListPrice_EUR_INV' as a facet-field. The solr-response for the query \n\n'solr/Products/select?q=*%3A*&wt=xml&indent=true&facet=true&facet.field=ListPrice_EUR_INV&f.ListPrice_EUR_INV.facet.sort=index'\n\nincludes the following facet-counts:\n\n<lst name=\"ListPrice_EUR_INV\">\n  <int name=\"-420.126\">1</int>\n  <int name=\"-285.672\">1</int>\n  <int name=\"-1.218\">1</int>\n</lst>\n\n\nIf I also set the parameter 'facet.mincount=1' in the query, the order of the facet-counts is reversed.\n\n<lst name=\"ListPrice_EUR_INV\">\n  <int name=\"-1.218\">1</int>\n  <int name=\"-285.672\">1</int>\n  <int name=\"-420.126\">1</int>\n</lst>\n\n\nI would have expected, that the sort-order of the facet-counts is not affected by the facet.mincount parameter, as it is in Solr 4.1.\nIs this related to SOLR-2850?",
