    "description": "As described in SOLR-6462, \n\ndoDeleteByQuery() is structured differently than processAdd() and processDelete() in DistributedUpdateProcessor. We refactored doDeleteByQuery() by extracting a portion of its code into a helper method versionDeleteByQuery() which is then overriden in the CdcrUpdateProcessor. This way doDeleteByQuery() is structurally similar to the other two cases and we are able to keep the CDCR logic completely separated.\n\nThis issue provides a patch for the DisitrbutedUpdateProcessor for trunk.",
