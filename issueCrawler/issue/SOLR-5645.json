            "content": "I almost think we should re roll 4.6.1 for this...\n\nI think the issue was probably not so bad in 4.6, because pre SOLR-5615, we were not careful about not starting new leader elections while old ones existed. So reload might have had funky issues due to this in 4.6, but they were not so evident as you can now have due to not being able to find a leader on reload (as exposed by fails on jenkins test runs).
