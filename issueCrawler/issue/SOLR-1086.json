For every FieldType except TextField, the result would be the same as if every token produced by the analyzer had been added as a multivalue.  a new \"ConcatAllTokenFilter\" could be added to make it easy for people concat all tokens produced by a tokenizer and other tokenfilters back into a single string if necessary.
