    "description": "The setter method names for the field statistics in the SolrQuery class are a little bit confusing and i think they should be renamed. \n\nI think a setter method should set a field to a given value and not just add a value to the existing field. For this behavior, an add method is more convinent.\n\nA patch is applyed to this issue. If you think is is not needed, just close this issue .\n\nThe existing setter methods are set to deprecated and some documentation is added to explain their behavior.",
