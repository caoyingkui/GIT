    "description": "Spinoff from discussion in solr-user list http://find.searchhub.org/document/8dfce8a277de0f2a\n\nThe managed synonyms filter does not behave the same way as the original synonym filter when a list is added. The original synonyms filter with default expand=true produces the following map when parsing a line:\n\nInput:\n\n  a, b, c\n\n\n\nBecomes:\n\n  a => a, b, c\n  b => a, b, c\n  c => a, b, c\n\n\n\nBut the managed filter excludes the original term in the mapping, so an input [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] becomes:\n\n\n  a => b, c\n  b => a, c\n  c => a, b\n\n\n\nThis can also be seen in TestManagedSynonymFilterFactory.java where it is tested explicitly, while the tests for the file based synonymfilter expect an all-way expand including the original term.\n\nThis causes a query for \"a\" to not match documents with the term \"a\", but only those with term \"b\" or \"c\".\n\nThe offending line in ManagedSynonymFilterFactory is this\n\n188:   treeTerms.remove(origTerm);",
