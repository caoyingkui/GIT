    "description": "ReusableAnalyzerBase currently ignores the fieldName passed into .tokenStream/.reusableTokenStream and reuses the same components for every field.  To move all Analyzers over to using ReusableAnalyzerBase, we need to support per-field reuse as well.\n\nAs Robert pointed out in LUCENE-2309, we can do this by adding a ReuseStrategy which has two impls; one implementing the current global behavior and one providing per-field reuse.",
