    "description": "It is a common use case, when you have configured the highlighter in your request handler to quickly get a pojo object containing the highlighted content, instead of accessing the highlighting snippet map.\n\nit could be useful to have an option in the document binder to take a look first to the highlighted snippets and then fallback to the normal field ( usually the fallback is already in the highlighter component anyway) .\n\nIn this way would be much simpler for a SolrJ user to get directly a java pojo bean, with the fields already with the highlighted value.\nWithout accessing both the pojo and the highlighting map, and make intersection.",
