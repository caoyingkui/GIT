    "description": "While documenting legacy distributed search, for the purpose of an example, I wanted to start 2 instances on the same machine in standalone mode with a core each and the same config set.\nHere's what I did to start the 2 nodes:\n\nbin/solr start -s example/nodes/node1 -p 8983\nbin/solr start -s example/nodes/node2 -p 8984 \n\n\nSo far so good. Now, create_core doesn't accept a port number and so it pseudo-randomly picks a node to create the core i.e. I can't create a core using scripts on both nodes smoothly unless we support \"-p <port number>\" with that call (and may be collection too?).\n\nFYI, I also tried :\n\nbin/solr start -s example/nodes/node1 -p 8983 -e techproducts\nbin/solr start -s example/nodes/node2 -p 8984 -e techproducts\n\n\n\nbut this failed as -e overrides -s. I don't really remember why we did that, but perhaps we can consider not overriding -s, even when -e is specified i.e. copy whatever is required and use -s.",
