But I think you hit on a real problem here.  Or at least, a real area for improvement.  The bin/solr scripts offer a lot of functionality to administrators, but the output format often makes it tough to script around that functionality.  Some commands are more prone to this than others, and there often workarounds via API calls.  But improving this might be a nice usability improvement at some point in the future.  Definitely the work of a separate JIRA.  Just mentioning it here as this brought it to mind. ",
