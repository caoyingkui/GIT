It could live at solr/docs/changes/Lucene-Changes.html.\n\nAlong these lines, the Solr News page could include a link to Lucene's Changes.html alongside the link to the Solr Changes.html (I'm assuming that, as on the Lucene News page, the CHANGES.txt link will actually be to the formatted Changes.html, once the functionality provided by this issue has stabilized.)
