    "description": "in LUCENE-3601, i worked up a change where we intentionally crash() all un-fsynced files \nin tests to ensure that we are calling sync on files when we should.\n\nI think this would be nice to do always (and with some fixes all tests pass).\n\nBut this is super-slow sometimes because when we corrupt the unsynced segments.gen, it causes\nSIS.read to take 500ms each time (and in checkindex for some reason we do this twice, which seems wrong).\n\nI can workaround this for now for tests (just do a partial crash that avoids corrupting the segments.gen),\nbut I wanted to create this issue for discussion about the sleeping/non-fsyncing of segments.gen, just\nbecause i guess its possible someone could hit this slowness.",
