Maybe an issue related to fixing the dependencies in the poms, which would include this and that for velocity.\n\nIn any case, to include the velocity deps in solr-core-pom.xml.template:\n\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>velocity</groupId>\n    <artifactId>velocity</artifactId>\n    <version>1.4</version>\n</dependency>\n\nNeeds to be added. (alternatively the version can be 1.5, if thats what we want to use) "
