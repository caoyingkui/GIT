    "description": "This is an offshoot of SOLR-9399. When I was writing a test, if I create a cluster with basic authentication set up, I can still add documents to a collection even without credentials being set in the request.\n\nHowever, simple queries, commits etc. all fail without credentials set in the request.\n\nI'll attach a test class that illustrates the problem.\n\nIf I use a new HttpSolrClient instead of a CloudSolrClient, then the update request fails as expected.\n\nNoble Paul do you have any insight here? Possibly something with splitting up the update request to go to each individual shard?",

Solrj mistakes this to be an inter server\u00a0request and sets the PKI authentication header. So this request is considered goes through using PKI authentication. commit() request is performed\u00a0in the same thread (not the thread pool) so it uses basic auth and works as expected.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo far so good.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs it a security vulnerability?\n\nNO\n\nThis is executed in the test JVM which already has a valid Solr which in turn has a valid PKIAuthenticationPlugin instance. Normally, when SolrJ is used outside in a JVM which does not have a Solr running inside, the PKIAuthenticationPlugin instance does not exist and the headers cannot be set and the request would fail , as expected.\n\n\u00a0\n\nis it a bug?\n\n\u00a0\n\nYES. But limited to the test environment\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs it a regression?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm not sure. We need further investigation to know that. ",
