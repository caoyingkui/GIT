    "description": "DELETEREPLICA asks for the ZK \"shard id\" (core_node_###) instead of the same syntax as createNodeSet?  I can't recall any other instance in which the ZK \"shard id\" is exposed via query parameter and I've only ever seen it in clusterstate.json / CLUSTERSTATUS calls.\n\nFor ease of use I humbly suggest that the API be amended to take the same parameters are ADDREPLICA and use either base_url or core_node_name.\n\nSpecifically, instead of REPLICA_PROP here https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/branch_4x/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/cloud/ZkStateReader.java#L64\nit would be more consistent to request a query param of the form: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/branch_4x/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/cloud/ZkStateReader.java#L58 \nor: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/branch_4x/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/cloud/ZkStateReader.java#L56\n\nAlso it appears DELETEREPLICA is missing from https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/branch_4x/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/common/params/CollectionParams.java",
