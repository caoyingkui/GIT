We should remove that in 8.0\n\nIt stays empty unless you explicitly ask to create the collection with the old \"stateFormat\" and there is no reason for one to create a collection with the old stateFormat.\n\nWe should also remove the \"stateFormat\" argument in create collection\n\nWe should also remove MIGRATESTATEVERSION as well",
