            "content": "Attaching new patch:\n\n\texample schema has int (trie field with no precisionStep) that will work for both single and multiValued fields, and tint (with default 8 step) that should only be used for single valued fields when faster range queries are desired. Fields like the old \"int\" are moved to \"pint\" for plain-int.\n\tdate faceting now works on trie date, and takes advantage of the faster range queries\n\ttrie fields now all have their own classes - this is much more flexible for the future (one example of this already was how date faceting works for the existing date field and the trie-date field... they needed to have a common super class).\n\tfrange now works on all trie fields\n\tprecisionStep is ignored for multi-valued trie fields\n\tefficiency: response writer methods don't go through toObject()\n\n "
