    "description": "This is a tricky yet interesting improvement.\n\nThe approximation would return a document as soon as min_should_match sub approximations match. Then when matching, it would iterate over approximations that are on the current document, and if matches() fails, it would try to replace the current approximation with one from the tail (approximations that are behind the current document).",
