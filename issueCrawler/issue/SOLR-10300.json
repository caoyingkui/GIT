However, new processes will be required for publishing online versions of the guide since that is brand new.",

This describes how to build both the PDF and HTML versions, and how to publish them to their respective homes (including holding a VOTE, etc.).\n\nA README in solr/solr-ref-guide describes the dependencies to build locally.\n\nAnything else required? I believe the remaining processes will be just like any other code change but could be missing something.\n\nNote SOLR-10301 is meant to cover how-tos for modifying templates and content. ",
