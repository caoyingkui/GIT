    "description": "In order to support MultiTermQuery subclasses the Highlighter component applies instanceof checks for concrete classes from the lucene core. This prevents classes like RegexQuery in contrib from being supported. Introducing dependencies on other contribs is not feasible just for being supported by the highlighter.\n\nWhile the instanceof checks and subsequent casts might hopefully go somehow away  in the future but for supporting more multterm queries I have a alternative approach using a fake IndexReader that uses a RewriteMethod to force the MTQ to pass the field name to the given reader without doing any real work. It is easier to explain once you see the patch - I will upload shortly.",

My idea was a Fieldable interface that provides getField and the highlighter must only check instanceof Fieldable.

I suppose we could make the argument that this can tide us over - but it will only take a couple of minutes to add getFields as well.\n\nI think Simon may argue that this will work in more cases by default - where external queries would have to implement the getFeilds method. Which is a good point. Still would prefer something cleaner, but perhaps that makes this worth it nonetheless. It would prob make sense to fall back to this if getFields returned an empty set anyway - which almost makes it not even worth it to do getFields as things don't get any cleaner ...\n\nWe def want the multitermquery clone - thats for sure - Uwe recently mentioned that as well and I'd been meaning to get around to it myself.

So might as well nix those plans for now. I'd prefer our \"futurebetterhighlighter\" prompt any changes that require so much hassle. Its prob best just to stick with this method.\n\nI'd just make it so the rest of the IndexReader methods act as if the thing is empty - letting it throw a null pointer exception and catching it makes those impls unhighlightable when they likely could be.

Its only a build dependency, so its not actually a big deal - just annoying if it happened to keep growing.\n\nedit\n\nHmm - actually, it looks like we can't avoid those dependencies after all - not if we want to test those queries - looks like the contrib dependency on regex stays anyway.
