I'm not a ZK expert so I may be missing something, but I do think it would make it easier while developing and testing, as you don't need to start zkClient or anything like that to create these directories, and you don't need delete zk data directory, restart zk nodes, etc. "

Other options I thought are:\n\u2022\tOnly create the initial path when bootstrap_conf is true (or bootstrap_confdir). This could still have the same issue described above.\n\u2022\tAdd a new parameter to force creation, something like \u2013DzkHost.create=true. This could add unnecessary parameters and configuration complexity. "

            "content": "Yeah, I think that was perhaps the concern - basically, it seems ops type people prefer being explicit. Other paths are auto-created, but they are not arbitrary paths supplied by the user as a connect string - I guess it's a little different. If you are trying to connect to an existing node and type something wrong, you just create a new one rather than getting an error.\n\nI don't know what's best, but like I said, I guess I lean towards auto creating.
