We might be able to prevent DBQs from getting re-ordered by making sure, at the leader, that all updates before a DBQ have been written successfully on the replicas, and block all updates after the DBQ until the DBQ is written successfully at the replicas.",

Do you see them outside of PeerSyncs? ",
