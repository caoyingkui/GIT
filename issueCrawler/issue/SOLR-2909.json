Sekiguchi-san, this sounds like a good idea to me.\n\nMy understanding is that the problem also occurs when using SynonymFilterFactory and that the above will address this case as well since the actual synonym handling is being done by SlowSynonymFilterFactory or FSTSynonymFilterFactory through delegation (based on version).  Is this correct?  Thanks. "
