    "description": "Say you keep reusing a boolean filter that looks like \"A OR B\" and never use the A and B queries out of that boolean query. Currently, after this filter has been used 5 times, we would cache both A, B and \"A OR B\", which means that cache entries for A and B would only be built for the purpose of building a cache entry for \"A OR B\", which is wasteful.\n\nBy caching compound queries a bit earlier, we could make it less likely to happen since:\n\n\twe only consider queries as consumed if a scorer is pulled\n\tonce the boolean query is cached, we stop pulling scorers on the A and B queries",
