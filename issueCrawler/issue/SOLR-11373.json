There's even a comment saying:\n\n# set to INFO to enable infostream log messages\n\n\n\nDue to this bug, even if you enable infoStream in solrconfig.xml, infoStream isn't logged unless you also change log4j.properties.\n\nWe should match the config in log4j.properties to the comment and then people can use the solrconfig.xml to enable infoStream.",
