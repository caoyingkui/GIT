    "description": "Now that the V2 API is in place and there's the nifty introspection end point, it would be great to display them from the UI. Someone with UI skills could create a link on the admin page that people could just click on. The commands could be displayed, perhaps in a tree view with tooltips?\n\nThe returned data has a link to the ref guide we could display too (would it hit the version they were on automatically?).\n\nClicking on a link could bring up the details of the commands. In the simplest form, users could just put the command in the address bar from there. More complex auto-generated forms seem possible, but just having this in place would be an enormous time-saver.\n\nRelated to SOLR-10888 which is a command-line version of something similar, they seem complementary.",
