Would you give it a once-over? Feel free to just fix anything you think should be rephrased. \n\n(I just noticed I used ByteBuffersDirectory and not ByteBuffersDirectoryFactory, so I'll fix that mistake now.)\n\nHere's the section for your convenience (with the correction I'm about to make):\n\n\n* Lucene has introduced the `ByteBuffersDirectoryFactory` as a replacement for the `RAMDirectoryFactory`, which will be removed in Solr 9.\n+\nWhile most users are still encouraged to use the `NRTCachingDirectoryFactory`, which allows Lucene to select the best directory factory to use, if you have explicitly configured Solr to use the `RAMDirectoryFactory`, you are encouraged to switch to the new implementation as soon as possible before Solr 9 is released.\n+\nFor more information about the new directory factory, see the Jira issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8438[LUCENE-8438].\n+\nFor more information about the directory factory configuration in Solr, see the section <<datadir-and-directoryfactory-in-solrconfig.adoc#datadir-and-directoryfactory-in-solrconfig,DataDir and DirectoryFactory in SolrConfig>>.\n\n\n ",
