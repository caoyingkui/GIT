I've changed handleAddReplica() and handleRemoveReplica() methods. I think that there may be methods wrapper methods for such kind of things that accepts SolrParams as parameter. So I've implemented that wrappers and I could easily write a method that wraps existing actions. I've tested it and works (not for cases which tests Overseer actions). "
