    "description": "New in java 6, we have java.text.Normalizer that supports Unicode Standard Annex #15 normalization.\nhttp://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/Normalizer.html\nhttp://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/\n\nThe normalization defined has four variants of C, D, KC, KD. Canonical Decomposition or Compatibility Decomposition will be normalize the representation of a String, and the search result will be improved.\n\nI'd like to submit a TokenFilter code supporting this feature!",

I used the Normalizer to implement my own custom analyzer for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1032. \nThere is actually a Normalizer equivalent in older versions of the Sun JDK, sun.text.Normalizer, but this obviously wouldn't end up being portable across VMs. \n\nI ended up using reflection to determine the presence of Normalizer if it existed, then fell back to sun.text.Normalizer, then finally performing no normalization if neither could be found to preserve compatibility with non Java 6/ Sun JDKs.
