    "description": "I have an installation of Lucene that has around 35000 documents in it.  When \nI do a normal search that used to work on Lucene1.2 I get the exception \nbelow.  This error, is not allowing my search to work at all.  \n\nOn a smaller development system with only a few documents I ran the debugger \non the code.  A similar query as on the 35K system had 3 clauses with 6 nested \nclauses.  I notice that after the BooleanQuery.rewrite() method was called, I \nhad over 200 nested clauses.   I am not sure what the purpose of the rewrite() \nmethod is (weighting maybe), but it seems to be conflicting with the 1024 \nmaxClauseCount limit.   \n\n__12c55e4:search.advancedSearchResults) Internal Processing exception\norg.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:109)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:101)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.MultiTermQuery.rewrite\n(MultiTermQuery.java:9\n9)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.rewrite(BooleanQuery.java:244)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.rewrite(BooleanQuery.java:244)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.rewrite\n(IndexSearcher.java:188\n)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Query.weight(Query.java:120)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search\n(IndexSearcher.java:128)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.getMoreDocs(Hits.java:93)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.<init>(Hits.java:80)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:71)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:65)",

So, what seems to be happening is that the PrefixQuery.rewrite() \nexpands the query for each individual hit.  Thus, if the search result has \nmore than 1024 results, the rewrite fails. ",

However, aren't you worried that the weighting functionality is \ncreating a query with thousands of clauses?  I would think since my original \nquery only had 9 clauses that I would not have to change the settings.  Maybe \nthere should be a setting to allow turning off the weighting?   ",
