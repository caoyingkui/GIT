    "description": "I know this is the locallucene lib, but wanted to make sure we don't get this bug when it gets into lucene contrib.\n\nI suspect that the issue is that deleted documents are trying to be evaluated by the filter.  I did some debugging and I confirmed that it is bombing on a document that is marked as deleted (using Luke).\n\n\nThanks!\n\nUsing the locallucene library 1.51, I get a NullPointerException at line 123 of DistanceFilter\nThe method is \tpublic BitSet bits(IndexReader reader) \nThe line is double x = NumberUtils.SortableStr2double(sx);\n\nThe stack trace is:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.apache.solr.util.NumberUtils.SortableStr2long(NumberUtils.java:149)\n\tat org.apache.solr.util.NumberUtils.SortableStr2double(NumberUtils.java:104)\n\tat com.pjaol.search.geo.utils.DistanceFilter.bits(DistanceFilter.java:123)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Filter.getDocIdSet(Filter.java:49)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:140)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:112)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.getMoreDocs(Hits.java:113)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.<init>(Hits.java:90)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:72)",
