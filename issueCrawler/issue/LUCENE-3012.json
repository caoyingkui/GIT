            "content": "Updated patch (against branch_3x for simplicity) that uses the LUCENE-3014 comparator API.\n\nBecause separate norms files are independent of the version that created the segment (e.g. one can call setNorm with 3.6 for a 3.1 segment), I think its really important that we fix this in 3.2 to write the header.\n\nIf there are no objections, I'd like to commit, and then regenerate the tentative 3.2 indexes for trunk's TestBackwardsCompatibility.\n\nThere's no need to change the fileformats.html documentation, as what we are doing now is actually inconsistent with it, thus the bug.
