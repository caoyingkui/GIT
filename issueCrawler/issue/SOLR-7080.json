But there is no apparent way to bootstrap this value from (say) core.properties or solrconfig.xml.\n\nIn general this is an issue when trying to migrate cores to new servers or when trying to recover a completely failed zookeeper environment.  But I think it should be possible to establish this configuration detail from some one of the configuration settings in either core.properties or solrconfig.xml.",
