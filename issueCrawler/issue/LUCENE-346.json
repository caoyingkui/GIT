    "description": "Here's a patch that disables Similiarty.coord() in the scoring of most\nautomatically generated boolean queries.  The coord() score factor is\nappropriate when clauses are independently specified by a user, but is usually\nnot appropriate when clauses are generated automatically, e.g., by a fuzzy,\nwildcard or range query.  Matches on such automatically generated queries are\ncurrently penalized for not matching all terms.",

That should probably be\nmodified to generate something like, for the query \"t1 t2\" over fields f1, and\nf2, a query like:\n\n  (f1:t1 f2:t1) (f1:t2 f2:t2)\n\nin this case the innner queries should have coord disabled while the outer query\nshould not.  I think the best approach for MultiFieldQueryParser is to\nre-implement it as a subclass of QueryParser which overrides query creation\nmethods.  But that's a separate patch... ",
