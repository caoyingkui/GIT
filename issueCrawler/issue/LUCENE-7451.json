            "content": "We try to reserve the JIRA lists for actual, identified code problems or improvement, not usage questions.\n\nThis is almost certainly an error in your code, most likely your analysis chain (i.e. the tokenizer + filters you use for this field) are breaking up the input on, perhaps, non-characters or the like. And/or the query parser you use to search is doing something similar. If you're using a simple tokenization process like whitespace this should be just fine. How you deal with periods at the ends of sentences is another issue \n\nThus the suggestion you use the user's list for the question until there is some evidence that this is an actual code problem in Lucene. You'll benefit because there are many more people who view/use/answer questions on the user's list than via JIRAs, so you'll get answers faster.\n\nWhen you do post a message on the user's list, please include enough data to help diagnose the problem other than \"it doesn't work\".
