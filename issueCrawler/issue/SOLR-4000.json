    "description": "In 3.x, the admin gui page for cache statistics includes autowarmCount.  In 4.0, this particular number is missing.  Unaware of this, I asked someone on the user list for their cache statistics, thinking it would be included.  The regenerator (available in 3.x) is also not included, but that's probably mostly unnecessary.\n\nThe information is in the SolrInfoMBeanHandler (/admin/mbeans?stats=true) output.",

When I gathered the information from my own system, I picked the first core, which it turns out has autowarmCount=\"0\" in it.  Just now I tried another core and it had all the same information as 3.x does, including autowarmCount and regenerator. "
