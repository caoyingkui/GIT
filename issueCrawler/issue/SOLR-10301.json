            "content": "I would like to publish these meta-docs online somewhere, and I've thought of a few possibilities:\n\n\n\tManually convert them to HTML and put them on the website, maybe under http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide. Maintenance would be a (minor) issue here. I really don't want to introduce a manual process though.\n\tPut them all in the Solr Wiki. I spent approximately 10 seconds thinking about how much fun it would be to take AsciiDoc and jam it into MarkDown ... and then discarded this idea.\n\tPublish them with the rest of the Guide. This is my preferred idea, so I thought some more about it...\n\n\n\nMy proposal: \n\n\n\tMove the directory solr-ref-guide/meta-docs and its contents to solr-ref-guide/src/meta-docs so they are found by the build process.\n\tCreate a new page how-to-contribute.adoc that will have different content depending on the format:\n\t\n\t\tHTML will use the include macro to pull the pages that are currently in solr-ref-guide/meta-docs into one large page. An alternate idea would be for them to be separate pages, but I rather like them being in a discreet directory from the other content.\n\t\tPDF will have an intro paragraph and point users to the online version of how-to-contribute.html. The reason I wanted to do this is the PDF is already really, really long, and it feels like content that is better served online instead.\n\t\n\t\n\tIn the HTML version, the last item in the sidebar navigation will be a new top-level heading \"How to Contribute\".\n\n\n\nIt would also be possible to only publish the content if the page is (or is not) a DRAFT - but, personally I think it's fine to publish it in the \"live\" HTML version.\n\nIf there aren't any objections or better ideas, I'll get this done tomorrow.
