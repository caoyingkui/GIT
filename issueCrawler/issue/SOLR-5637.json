    "description": "We have found it very useful to have information on the number of cache hits and misses for key Solr caches (filterCache, documentCache, etc.) at the request level.\n\nThis is currently implemented in our codebase using custom SolrCache implementations.\n\nI am working on moving to maintaining stats in the SolrRequestInfo thread-local, and adding hooks in get() methods of SolrCache implementations. This will be glued up using the DebugComponent and can be requested using a \"debug.cache\" parameter.",
