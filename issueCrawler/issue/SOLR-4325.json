    "description": "Yesterday was DST change in Fidji (clock went one hour backwards, as summer time ended and winter time started). This caused org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.TestBuiltInEvaluators.testDateFormatEvaluator to fail. The reason is simple: NOW-2DAYS is evaluated without taking time zone into account (its substracting 48 hours), but to be correct and go 2 DAYS back in local wall clock time, it must subtract only 47 hours. If this is not intended (we want to go 48 hours back, not 47), the test needs a fix. Otherwise the date evaluator must take the timezone into account when substracting days (e.g., use correctly localized Calendar instance and use the add() method (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html#add(int, int)).",
