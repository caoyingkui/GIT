    "description": "Recent experiments with thousands of collections have revealed some things that would be really helpful on the cloud graph page when there are more than a handful of collections:\n\n\n\tA filter option with a name like \"Not Healthy\" so that only nodes/replicas with detectable problems are shown.\n\tSummary counts of nodes and/or replicas, showing how many are in each of the five states (active, recovering, down, recovery failed, gone).  I don't know that it makes sense to count the number of leaders, but if it does, include that too.\n\tI'd like to be able to configure the default number of items shown per page.  That would probably be a solr.xml option.  As far as I can tell, it's not currently possible to configure this.",
