            "content": "Patch: I tried to find all the places that involved offsets with term vectors, and added a corresponding option for payloads.  For FieldProperties I just assigned the next available flag; I assume I couldn't shift the existing ones (are these not supposed to change, for back-compat?).\n\nI also added returning payloads from TermVectorComponent, encoded as base64, and added a simple test confirming that payloads come back when indexed.

At first I was just thinking this was a small matter of the schema but you thought of the TermVectorComponent, LukeRequestHandler, etc.\n\nI did make a change to TermVectorComponent.mapOneVector so that the postings flag indicates the options we want... and I simplified the code a little to not need the 3 useOffsets|Positions|Payloads booleans which seemed redundant with the same booleans on fieldOptions.\n\nTests pass, precommit passes.\n\nIf you don't have time to commit then I will be happy to.
