    "description": "From Konstantin Gribov on the dev list:\n\n\nCurrently API docs for Lucene can be found in 2 clicks from lucene.apache.org (\"lucene core\" link, then 5.2.1 in \"release docs\"). \n\nBut it isn't so easy for Solr. I haven't found it on lucene.apache.org/solr/ site anywhere (maybe it can be found somewhere in cwiki, but not on front page of reference guide there). Only google helped me with it.\n\n[...]\n\nI think, link to lucene.apache.org/solr/api/ should be added to resources/docs on Solr site.\n\nThe text \u201cLatest Release\u201d directly under the \u201cDocumentation\u201d heading at <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html#documentation> is supposed to link to the Solr equivalent of the Lucene release docs - if you look at the source for the page it\u2019s:\n\n\n<h2 id=\"documentation\">Documentation</h2>\n<h3 class=\"offset\" id=\"release-documentation>Release Documentation</h3>\n\n<p>In each Solr binary release artifact, you can find a copy of the Solr tutorial, a detailed list of changes, and JavaDocs for all included code.\nCopies of this documentation for the most recent release of each major branch under active development can also be found online:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/solr/5_2_0/index.html\">Latest Release</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\nBut for me on Safari on OS X, most of this text is invisible (including the \"Release Documentation\" header and the paragraph starting \"In each Solr binary release artifact\"), and the \u201cLatest Release\u201d text does not link to the release docs.",
