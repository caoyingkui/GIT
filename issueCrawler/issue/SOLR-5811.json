            "content": "When the Overseer was first considered, one of the primary ideas was that commands could fail over if not completed or be retried on failures, etc. A lot of this is not there yet. The Overseer will actually retry failed commands now, but it's much too dumb about it - a command that cannot or will not succeed will tie up the whole processing pipeline.\n\nIn the short term, I don't think we should retry most work items. \n\nLonger term, it seems like we should track retries and perhaps give up at some point - or something smart than retrying as fast as possible until success.
