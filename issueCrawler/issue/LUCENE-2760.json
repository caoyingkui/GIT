    "description": "SpanFirstQuery and SpanPositionRangeQuery (SpanFirst is just a special case of this), are currently inefficient.\n\nTake this worst case example: SpanFirstQuery(\"the\").\nCurrently the code reads all the positions for the term \"the\".\n\nBut when enumerating spans, once we have passed the allowable range we should move on to the next document (skipTo)",
