I think we should expose the Collections API for SolrCloud collections and keep using the CoreAdmin API for cores until the non-cloud Collections API is done.  If the new API is done right, it will be substantially similar to the existing CoreAdmin API, so the admin UI migration should be very easy.\n\nThe CoreAdmin API is not going to disappear, at least not in any 5.x version.  It just won't be publicly documented any more, and users will be encouraged to switch to the Collections API.  Some deprecations in SolrJ are likely. "

The field definition is not present as well . Maybe we should make the terms handler distributed as well?\n\tI get a \"healthcheck not configured\" error when I first select a core.\n\tPing request handler works on distributed mode as well after SOLR-7746 so maybe we put it in the collections tab?\n\n\n\nI'll try taking a more in-depth look at it soon.
