    "description": "Currently it is propagated, which means that one collector can hide hits to another collector. We could try to reconcile min scores across collectors to take the maximum min score, but I don't think it's worth the effort as combinations are most often going to include one collector that needs top hits and another one that doesn't need scores at all (eg. facets or total hits) rather than another collector that also needs top scoring documents.",
