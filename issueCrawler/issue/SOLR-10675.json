Specifying -Dsolr-guide-version=X.Y on the command line when building a guide release is just like specifying -Dversion=X.Y.Z when releasing the code \u2013 the only reason for the new/diff prop name on the command line is simply to allow us to still read the (existing) version value from versions.properties on the current branch to correctly identify which major.minor version of solr we're publishing the guide for.\n\n\nAnd by the way, the PDF file on jenkins does not have \"-SNAPSHOT\" in the version number ...\n\nthe branch_6_6 and branch_6x jenkins guide jobs both (currently) include -DRAFT in their artifact name as intended.  the master jenkis guide job does not \u2013 but that's only because that job last ran BEFORE i committed these changes.\n\nThe choice of \"-DRAFT\" vs \"-SNAPSHOT\" was deliberate to be consistent with the way we refered to the cwiki content prior to this migration.  If you think we should cahnge that please file a new issue.  (Personally i think that while SNAPSHOT makes sense for \"code builds\", the term \"DRAFT\" will be easier for folks to udnerstand in the context of documentation. ",
