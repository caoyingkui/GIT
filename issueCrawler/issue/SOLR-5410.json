No need to reference Yonik's Law on this patch any more...I don't think.\n\n\n\tNow processes SolrParams to configure the parser\n\tNow also handles fields that are not TextField\n\tPatched for SOLR-5594\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Jason Robinson for the initial patch (and very fruitful collaboration).  Thanks also to SimpleQParserPlugin as a model!\n\nAny and all feedback is welcome.  Thank you. "
