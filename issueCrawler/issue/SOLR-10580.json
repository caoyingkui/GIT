    "description": "Certain statistics have common elements that they need to track or calculate.  These should be de-duplicated somehow when multiple facet functions are requested on the same field.\n\nAs an example, one of the most basic stats is the number of values for a field in a bucket.  This is needed for calculating mean as well as variance and stddev.",
