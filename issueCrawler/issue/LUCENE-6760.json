    "description": "Java 9 changed its character tables to unicode version 7.0. The table updates are listed here: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/jdk/rev/86206517258d\n\nBecause of this, character \\u180E is no longer treated as whitespace, so TestUtil#randomWhitespace() fails.\n\nI will remove this character from the list and update the documentation JRE_VERSION_MIGRATION.txt.\n\nWe should maybe make this character list dynamic (e.g. TestUtil initializes it on static class init one time by iterating over all 16 bit characters). Maybe somebody else has an idea (there is already a TODO in the code about that).",

I will go for the first patch and simply remove the non-whitespace character.\n\nFYI, I checked with Eclipse call trace: The method is only used by this single test, so it's not really a useful utility method in TestUtil. We should move it to the test. But I will for now only fix the problem, so the recent Java 9 builds pass! "
