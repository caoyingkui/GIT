    "description": "Collections.sort works by dumping its content into an array, sorting it with Arrays.sort and then getting the elements back into the list. On the contrary, CollectionUtil has the ability to sort in-place when the list supports random-access, this is more memory-efficient and maybe even faster in some cases.\n\nWe could use the forbidden-apis tool to prevent our code from calling Collections.sort.",
