    "description": "Original discussion:\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Package-Access-Issues---Extending-FacetComponent-to19148122.html\n\nThe FacetComponent class uses several helper classes that currently have package-restricted access. This makes it impossible to extend the FacetComponent without rewriting most of its functionality.\n\nA proposed solution is to make those classes public and make their public member variables accessibly only through get and set functions (i.e. make them private).",

The getter/setters seem to be just noise. They may give us some flexibility in the future but in this case that might not be needed?\n\nWhat do you think? "
