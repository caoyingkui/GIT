    "description": "Followup from LUCENE-6508\n\nWe should ultimately remove this parameter, it is just sugar over a \"sleeping lock factory\" today that sleeps and retries until timeout, like the old code.\n\nBut really if you want a lock that blocks until its obtained, you can simply specify the sleeping lock factory yourself (and have more control over what it does!), or maybe an NIO implementation based on the blocking FileChannel.lock() or something else.\n\nSo this stuff should be out of indexwriter and not baked into our APIs.\n\nI would like to:\n1) deprecate this, mentioning to use the sleeping factory instead\n2) change default of deprecated timeout to 0, so you only sleep if you ask. I am not really sure if matchVersion can be used, because today the default itself is also settable with a static setter <-- OVERENGINEERED",
