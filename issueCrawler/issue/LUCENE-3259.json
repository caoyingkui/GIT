I don't mind if we change the contract to hasPayload() first, then getPayload().\n\nBut if we want to follow, e.g. DocIdSetIterator, where you call nextDoc() and get the doc ID back, without calling next() followed by docID(), then I think getPayload() should be enough here too. Especially for cases where we know a payload was written.\n\nWhat do you think? ",

I don't mind if we change the contract to hasPayload() first, then getPayload().\n\nLet me rephrase what I mean: currently if you call getPayload(), and there is no payload, it does not actually always return null  So its \"defined\" but does not work as defined.\n\nThe only safe thing at the moment to do if you are not sure if there is a payload, is to check hasPayload() first, and if this returns false, do not mess with getPayload().\n\nIf you are sure there is a payload, you don't need to do anything with hasPayload().
