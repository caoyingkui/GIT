Please feel free to change as needed, it is just a starting point.\n\nAs per Doug's discussion way back when (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/18320?search_string=code%20style;#18320), I don't think it is a big deal if submitted code isn't 100% formatted the way we want.\n\nAttachment to follow.",
