    "description": "Prior to SOLR-6058 the /solr/tutorial.html link on the website contained only a simple landing page that then linked people to the \"versioned\" tutorial for the most recent release \u2013 or more specificly: the most recent release*s* (plural) when we were releasing off of multiple branches (ie: links to both the 4.0.0 tutorial, as well as the 3.6.3 tutorial when 4.0 came out)\n\nThe old tutorial content lived along side the solr code, and was automatically branched, tagged & released along with Solr.  When committing any changes to Solr code (or post.jar code, or the sample data, or the sample configs, etc..) you could also commit changes to the tutorial at th same time and be confident that it was clear what version of solr that tutorial went along with.\n\nAs part of SOLR-6058, it seems that there was a concensus to move to a keeping \"tutorial\" content on the website, where it can be integrated directly in with other site content/navigation, and use the same look and feel.\n\nI have no objection to this in principle \u2013 but as a result of this choice, there are outstanding issues regarding how devs should go about maintaining this doc as changes are made to solr & the solr examples used in the tutorial.\n\nWe need a clear process for where/how to edit the tutorial(s) as new versions of solr come out and cahnges are made that mandate corisponding hanges to the tutorial.  this process should also account for things like having multiple versions of the tutorial live at one time (ie: at some point in the future, we'll certainly need to host the \"5.13\" tutorial if that's the current \"stable\" release, but we'll also want to host the tutorial for \"6.0-BETA\" so that people can try it out)",

I decided to leave in per-field querying, and not mention any caveats, since I figure SOLR-9526 will change the situation shortly.  I didn't find any other problems.\n\nFinally, the patch also includes a new target generate-website-quickstart in solr/build.xml that makes few minor modifications to quickstart.mdtext (see comments in the build file for details) and puts the result at solr/build/website/quickstart.mdtext.  This is a low-impact mechanism to allow the content to be shared between the bundled docs and the website.\n\nIf there are no objections I'll commit in a day or so, and put the modified version of the quickstart tutorial up on the website.

Or is there some sort of discussion on which features need to be highlighted and which can be omitted.\n\nI think the normal process should work okay - Lucene/Solr's official process is commit-then-review, but (as I've just done) pre-commit communication via patches should work too.  But maybe you're thinking about the live website?  I think we should err on the side of exhausting available review prior to publishing there.  (My version of that here was giving a rough deadline at which I'll publish if I havn't gotten any review.)\n\nAnd with links to the Reference Guide, do we link into the live version of it (easy and convenient) or do an offline reference to the version-matched export?\n\nAll of the links are to specific sections in the ref guide, and while I've seen internal PDF links work (depending on how the PDF was created and the PDF reader being used), I don't think they're dependable enough to allow us to use for this purpose.  So I don't think there's a real choice at this point.   However, once Cassandra Targett's ref guide work is in place (https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc), we should be able to make version-matched online docs that would be suitable for outbound links from the tutorial.
