    "description": "The FieldAnalysisRequestHandler provides the analysis functionality of the web admin page as a service. This handler accepts a filetype/fieldname parameter and a value and as a response returns a breakdown of the analysis process. It is also possible to send a query value which will use the configured query analyzer as well as a showmatch parameter which will then mark every matched token as a match.\n\nIf this handler is added to the code base, I also recommend to rename the current AnalysisRequestHandler to DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler and have them both inherit from one AnalysisRequestHandlerBase class which provides the common functionality of the analysis breakdown and its translation to named lists. This will also enhance the current AnalysisRequestHandler which right now is fairly simplistic.",

With this coming in, we will have three places which help with analysis (analysis.jsp, AnalysisRequestHandler and FieldAnalysisRequestHandler). Would you like to take a stab at this before we commit?\n\nI doubt our refactoring will change the public API (the request/response format) for any of the three. Therefore, I'm fine with refactoring later and committing this as-is. "

The old AnalysisRequestHandler will be deprecated and it's (enhanced) functionality will be available via the DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler. That said, it would be nice to be backward compatible as much as possible for those who are using the old ARH already (I suspect not many are using it anyway as it's mostly used for tooling and debugging).

I didn't feel best with it as well, but that how the original analysis handler worked so I just followed that\n\n\nAnd that got me thinking why there are SolrJ classes dedicated to it... and I'm not sure that we should take up space for that.\n\nIMO, common things in SolrJ should have easier, more type safe interfaces and uncommon, advanced features should be accessed via the generic APIs in order to keep the interfaces smaller and more understandable for the general user.\n\nWhy wouldn't you want SolrJ support for it? IMO, it would be great to have SolrJ support for every request handler that ships out of the box with Solr. It makes the user's life simpler and easier to use Solr this way. And as far as space is concerned... how much does it really add to the overall size of solrj jar? In any case, we're not talking of megabytes here... and for most people it doesn't really matter - I think it's more important to provide a simple and user friendly API to work with, and if the cost is to add a few extra classes I think it's a pretty cheap price to pay. It is true (I also mentioned it before) that it's not a major functionality that will be used often... but it is useful to have for tooling support - We're using it in one of the tools that we've created and the admin website can use it as well.
