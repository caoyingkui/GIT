    "description": "It would be great if there was a clean simple approach to plugin custom analytics to Solr.\n\nThis ticket introduces the AnalyticsQuery class which makes this possible.\n\nTo add a custom analytic query you extend AnalyticsQuery and implement:\n\n  public abstract DelegatingCollector getAnalyticsCollector(ResponseBuilder rb, IndexSearcher searcher);\n\n\n\nThis method returns a custom DelegatingCollector which handles the collection of the analytics.\n\nThe DelegatingCollector.finish() method can be used to conveniently finish your analytics and place the output onto the response.\n\nThe AnalyticsQuery also has a nifty constructor that allows you to pass in a MergeStrategy (see SOLR-5973). So, when you extend AnalyticsQuery you can pass in a custom MergeStrategy to handle merging of analytic output from the shards during a distributed search.\n\nThis design is a natural extension of the PostFilter framework. So you can plugin your AnalyticsQuery with a custom QParserPlugin, for example:\n\nq=*:*&fq={!myanalytic param1=p1}\n\n\n\nJust like PostFilters, AnalyticsQueries can be ordered using the \"cost\" parameter. This allows for analytic pipe-lining, where the result of one AnalyticsQuery can be pipe-lined to another AnalyticsQuery.",
