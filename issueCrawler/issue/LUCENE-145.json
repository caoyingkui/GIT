    "description": "The URL I gave is to an archived Lucene-User mailing list post, in which a new\nuser describes surprise at phrase queries succeeding when stopwords appear\nbetween phrase tokens in the original text.\n\nI think that the default StopFilter.java implementation should implement the\nposition adjusting behavior described in the Lucene API docs:\n<URL:http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Token.html#setPositionIncrement(int)>\n\"Set [the position increment] to values greater than one to inhibit exact phrase\nmatches. If, for example, one does not want phrases to match across removed stop\nwords, then one could build a stop word filter that removes stop words and also\nsets the increment to the number of stop words removed before each non-stop\nword. Then exact phrase queries will only match when the terms occur with no\nintervening stop words.\"",
