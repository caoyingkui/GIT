            "content": "FWIW, since this confused me a bit...\n\n\n\ton trunk...\n\t\n\t\tShardHandlerFactory has a close() method\n\t\tCoreContainer may create a ShardHandlerFactory, and closes it on shutdown\n\t\tSearchHandler may create a ShardHandlerFactory (if CoreContainer doesn't have one) and if so, then it registers a CloseHook to close it when the SearchHandler's SolrCore closes\n\t\tSOLR-3491 is another problem related to not closing ShardHandlerFactory instances in some cases, but that's unrelated to this issue.\n\t\n\t\n\ton 3x...\n\t\n\t\tShardHandlerFactory doesn't define a close() method\n\t\tSearchHandler is the only thing instantiating ShardHandlerFactory\n\t\tSearchHandler doesn't do anything to clean up the resources of the ShardHandlerFactory.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n(greg: did i miss anything?)\n\nSo with that in mind, it seems like:\n\n\n\tonly 3.6 is affected by this issue (not trunk)\n\ti think there is still a thread pool leak in SearchHandlerwith your patch...\n\n  private ShardHandlerFactory shardHandlerFactory = new HttpShardHandlerFactory();\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my suggestion for 3x instead of your patch would be...\n\n1) let \"shardHandlerFactory\" init to null, and assign it in SearchHandler.inform just like is done on trunk when CoreContainer doesn't have one (so SearchHandler never calls \"new HttpShardHandler\"\n2) instead of making HttpShardHandlerFactory SolrCoreAware, lets just give SearchHandler a close method (like on trunk), and have SearchHandler register the CloseHook for it just like it does in trunk\n\nSound good?
