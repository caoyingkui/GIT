    "description": "The conversion of PhraseQuery to SpanNearQuery miscalculates the slop if there are stop words in some cases.  The issue only really appears if there is more than one intervening run of stop words: ab the cd the the ef.\n\nI also noticed that the inOrder determination is based on the newly calculated slop, and it should probably be based on the original phraseQuery.getSlop()\n\npatch and unit tests on way",

I made some minor improvements to the code, somewhat making it similar to the conversion that WSTE does of MultiPhraseQuery in terms of keeping the positionGaps integer separate from slop.  And no loop is needed to calculate that gap.\n\np.s. when attaching patches, use the same file name for updates.  JIRA keeps all of them and clearly shows the latest. ",
