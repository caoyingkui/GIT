    "description": "there are handful of code paths in solr that use DocTermOrdsRangeFilter and DocValuesRangeFilter to do range queries over fields with DocValues \u2013 and in many cases this is to account for the \"field:[* TO *]\" type usecase (in some cases it's even done internally as an optimization of the \"field:*\" usecase.\n\nin these DocValue situations, if we know that hte uper & lower bounds are both null, we should make this code more optimized to use FieldValueFilter instead",
