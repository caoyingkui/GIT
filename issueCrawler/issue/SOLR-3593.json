    "description": "solr historically only had one version of the javadocs on the site at a time.\nparticularly now that we have 3.6.X and 4.X concurrently, this needs to change.  both sets of javadoc are already on the site, and \"/solr/tutorial.html\" already links to both versions appropriately but there are still some improvements that should be made...\n\n\n\tadd a \"/solr/api/index.html\" file that mirrors the type of inof listed on /core/documentation.html\n\t\n\t\twe could use the same \"documentation.html\" name, but since historically lots of people have bookmarked/linked to \"/solr/api\" reusing that path as the \"landing\" page for finding docs about multiple versions seems better\n\t\tmaking this visible will probably mean needing to dial in the existing /solr/api redirect more\n\t\n\t\n\tupdate the \"Javadocs\" link i nthe right nav to link to this page",
