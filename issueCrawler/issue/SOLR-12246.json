    "description": "Any time a full recovery happens, I get a failed checksum mismatch on the \".liv\" file.\n\ndate time WARN\u00a0 [recoveryExecutor-3-thread-5-processing-x:collection_shard_replica https:////host:port//solr//collection_shard_replica r:core_node69 n:host:port_solr c:collection s:shard] ? (:) - File _2yzfn_7pc.liv did not match. expected checksum is 4263266717 and actual is checksum 1689291857. expected length is 936757 and actual length is 936757\n\nToday we download the file anyways because of this check in IndexFetcher\n\nstatic boolean filesToAlwaysDownloadIfNoChecksums(String filename,\n    long size, CompareResult compareResult) {\n  // without checksums to compare, we always download .si, .liv, segments_N,\n  // and any very small files\n  return !compareResult.checkSummed && (filename.endsWith(\".si\") || filename.endsWith(\".liv\")\n  || filename.startsWith(\"segments_\") || size < _100K);\n}\n\nSo I think a WARN here is very confusing to a user who doesn't understand the internals of a full recovery .",
