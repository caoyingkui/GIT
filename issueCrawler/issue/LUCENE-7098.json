    "description": "Today we write all ords as longs, since we support more than 2.1B values in one segment, but the vast majority of the time an int would suffice.\n\nWe could look into vLong, but this quickly gets tricky because BKDWriter needs random access to the file and we rely on fixed-width entries to do this now.",

            "content": "Patch.  BKDWriter figures out up front whether it can use int or long to write all ords.  The caller must specific max number of values it will pass to this instance (hmm, I'll add checks to verify caller didn't exceed what it had promised).\n\nThis gives a nice speed up on the 6.1M London UK test, with the final merge going from 192.1 sec down to 171.1 sec to merge points.\n\nI'll make sure Test2BPoints passes with this change.

I think thats being too sneaky!\n\n "
