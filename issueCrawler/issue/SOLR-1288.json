I haven't checked, but does date faceting work on trie-type dates?\n\nShould the trie based date subclass DateField so we can have a common base class for all date related classes?  Seems like this would make it easier for separate components (like date faceting) to deal with. "

So we need to implement indexedToReadable in TrieField. Also, since trie fields are multi-valued, we need to short-cut faceting on using the highest precision value. "
