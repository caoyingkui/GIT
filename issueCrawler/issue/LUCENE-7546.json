    "description": "The people.apache.org server was replaced by a different server home.apache.org officially last year, and it appears to have completed sometime this year.  DNS for both points to the same machine but we should reference home.apache.org now.  Unfortunately, some data was large enough that ASF Infra didn't automatically move it, leaving that up to the individuals to do.  I think any data that hasn't been moved by now might be gone.\n\nHere's a useful reference to this: EMPIREDB-234   The second part of that issue also informs us that RC artifacts don't belong on home.apache.org; there is https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/<project> for that.  6.3 was done the right way... yet I see references to using people.apache.org in the build for RCs.",
