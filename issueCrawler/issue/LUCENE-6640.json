            "content": "Here is a proposal: add a new API called BitsProducer with the following definition:\n\n\n/** A producer of {@link Bits} per segment. */\npublic abstract class BitsProducer {\n\n  /** Return {@link Bits} for the given leaf. The returned instance must\n   *  be non-null and have a {@link Bits#length() length} equal to\n   *  {@link LeafReader#maxDoc() maxDoc}. */\n  public abstract Bits getBits(LeafReaderContext context) throws IOException;\n\n}\n\n\n\nAnd use it in lieu of Filter. Tests pass and I think it has the benefit of making the API a bit less trappy in the sense that it's now obvious that random-access is required? "
