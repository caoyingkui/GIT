    "description": "See LUCENE-5527 for more context: several of us seem to prefer Leaf to Atomic.\n\nTalking from my experience, I was a bit confused in the beginning that this thing is named AtomicReader, since Atomic is otherwise used in Java in the context of concurrency. So maybe renaming it to Leaf would help remove this confusion and also carry the information that these readers are used as leaves of top-level readers?",

It is pretty massive, but it also only took about 2 minutes using IntelliJ.\n\nI think the major bump to 5 is the perfect time to do this type of renaming.  Yes renaming presents a burden on consumers, but refactoring for clarity and ease of entry for new developers outweighs that burden, IMO. ",

For example we could declare readers are instances and have a docbase and parent. Multireaders and other weird shit could wrap the readers to fix this up. ",

A pure rename is useless. Unfortunately i was the one who added that name in the big IndexReader refactoring. But at that time we all agreed on that name.\nBut we should have thought better about it. LeafReader is fine, especially becaus ethe other APIs already use leave: Like ReaderContext#leaves().\nIf we really want to rename that, we should do this shortly before the release of 5.0. Otherwise merging might be much harder from trunk to 4.x. As this is just an eclipse rename of 2 classes (AtomicReader, AtomicReaderContext), this is not much work, just an Eclipse-automatism. The remaining classes is the same: FilterAtomicReader, and various test-only readers. ",
