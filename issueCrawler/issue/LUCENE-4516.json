    "description": "As a user, I'd like to associate a \u201cforeign key\u201d with a string (rather: final node) in the suggester index (in addition to the rank). For example, I\u2019d like to add \u201cLucene in Action\u201d with key 1933988177 (the ISBN) and some rank to a WFST or AnalyzingSuggester. A completion would return the completed string and the key associated with each entry (i.e. final nodes get a \u201ckey\u201d field (int), which is returned in the LookupResult). That foreign key could also be used for fast de-duping (no more string/byte array comparisons).\n\nThere may be workarounds for the \u201cforeign key\u201d use case \u2013it seems that lots of data structures would be affected by storing a user-provided key with final nodes, which therefore may not be a viable path. It may be possible to encode the foreign key in the transducer\u2019s output instead.\n\nDiscussion on java-user@lucene:\n\nMike McCandless: \n\nThis is maybe the same idea as\nLUCENE-4491 ?  Could you simply stuff your ISBN onto the end of the suggestion (ie enroll Lucene in\nAction|1933988177)?\n\nDawid Weiss:\n\nJust remember that if your suffixes are unique then you'll be expanding the automaton quite a bit (unique suffix paths).\n\nD.\n\nMike:\n\nThat's a good point... encoding into the FST's output may be better.",
