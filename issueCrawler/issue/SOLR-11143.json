It would be nice, however, if those links could dynamically add the Solr version based on the built version of Solr the specs are included with.\n\nSo, for Solr 7.5 (hypothetically), something like this:\n\n\"documentation\": \"https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/collections-api.html#create\"\n\nwould become this:\n\n\"documentation\": \"https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_5/collections-api.html#create\"",
