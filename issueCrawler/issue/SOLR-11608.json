    "description": "I noticed recently that the v2 Solr API's rename-core command fails to parse out the provided \"to\" parameter (which contains the desired new core name).\n\n_introspect shows the following documentation for the API:\n\n\n        \"rename\":{\n          \"type\":\"object\",\n          \"documentation\":\"https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/coreadmin-api.html#coreadmin-rename\",\n          \"description\":\"Change the name of a core.\",\n          \"properties\":{\n            \"to\":{\n              \"type\":\"string\",\n              \"description\":\"The new name for the core.\"},\n            \"async\":{\n              \"type\":\"string\",\n              \"description\":\"Defines a request ID that can be used to track this action after it's submitted. The action will be processed asynchronously when this is defined.\"}},\n          \"required\":[\"to\"]},\n\n\n\nbut it appears that the underlying code fails to parse out the \"to\" parameter:\n\n\n\u279c  solr git:(master) \u2717 curl -ilk -X POST \"$SOLR_HOST/api/cores/foo\" -d '{\"rename\": {\"to\":\"bar\"}}'\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 381\n\n{\n  \"responseHeader\":{\n    \"status\":400,\n    \"QTime\":0},\n  \"error\":{\n    \"metadata\":[\n      \"error-class\",\"org.apache.solr.common.SolrException\",\n      \"root-error-class\",\"org.apache.solr.common.SolrException\"],\n    \"msg\":\"Invalid core: [null]. core names must consist entirely of periods, underscores, hyphens, and alphanumerics as well not start with a hyphen\",\n    \"code\":400}}\n\n\n\nI'm not super familiar with the V2<->V1 API mapping code, but it looks like the underlying implementation in CoreAdminOperation is expecting a parameter named \"other\", but there's no mapping from \"to\" -> \"other\" for this particular API.",

Rather than adding a new test, I've fixed this existing test in the attached patch.\n\nAs a side note, I've also added other tests that touch on this area on SOLR-11551, which beefs up coverage of this area more generally.  But most of those tests aren't strictly related to this issue, so I didn't duplicate them on this patch as well.  But if SOLR-11551 gets in, we can feel even better about our test coverage here. ",
