On one hand, it makes you think you can ask for a.rts(\"a) and a.rts(\"b\") safely, but on the other it is documented to be not that safe (i.e., don't call this method if you need more than one token stream from an analyzer at the same time).\n\nI don't know how to solve it best - I'd like to have a tokenStream method that accepts the field name, and that I can get a reused token stream, for that field name. But I also would like to have a method that I can call \"get a reusable token stream\" and \"I don't care which field it is\". So maybe have two variants:\n\n\treusableTokenStream(Reader reader)\n\treusableTokenStream(String field, Reader reader)\nThis is kind of related to LUCENE-1678, as I think we'd like tokenStream to return a reused one, but maybe having a tokenStream which always returns a new one, and a reusableTokenStream (w/o a field) which reuses a stream (maybe the 'default' stream), would be good.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?

In addition we can do the following:\n\n\tDefine reset(String, Reader) on Streams, so that everyone just calls streams.reset(), instead of resetting tokenizer and tokenStream. Streams will do that internally.\n\tDefine a protected abstract getTokenizer() on Analyzer that all Analyzers implement. (due to back-compat, this can throw UOE - let's leave it for now).\n\tHave Analyzer's reusableTokenStream look like the following:\n\npublic TokenStream reusableTokenStream(String field, Reader reader) {\n  Streams streams = getPreviousTokenStream();\n  if (streams == null) {\n    streams = new Streams();\n    streams.tokenizer = getTokenizer(field, reader);\n    streams.tokenStream = tokenStream();\n    setPrevTS(streams);\n  } else {\n    streams.reset(field, reader);\n  }\n  return streams.tokenStream;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that can be even more simplified, by having Streams define a ctor which accepts Tokenizer and TokenStream. We can also instead of doing \"new Streams()\" call a method newStreams() so that sublcasses can override if they want to provide a different Streams impl. Not a must, and we might even consider the whole thing final (Streams, reusableTokenStream ? etc.)\n\nThat will save some code in that patch I believe.

I guess as long as getTokenizer() is not public and is documented as optional operation, then I would not have a problem with this case...\n\n\nI'll try to impl it tomorrow, using the new API and see how it goes.\nplease do, I think its a great idea!

If we could introduce such method on TokenStream, we wouldn't need to refer to Tokenizer directly.\n\ndo you have any ideas on the back compat issues?\n\nWell it's a bit trickier ... today we call reusableTokenStream in our indexing code, and either get a new instance, or a reused instance. We cannot change Analyzer's default behavior, which returns a new instance (unless we're willing to break back-compat), because Analyzers that did not override reusableTokenStream, may break if we start reusing the instance by default (for example if they add two fields to a document w/ reusableTokenStream called twice).\n\nAlso, deprecate reusableTokenStream and define a new one (say reuseTokenStream), and move to use it is not good either, since we want its default impl to reuse the token stream, and impls that did not override it may break.\n\nSo how about if we create a new abstract ReusingAnalyzer which impls reusableTokenStream to always reuse it. And we add Streams to Analyzer as a protected static class. That way, Analyzers that don't care about reuse, can still extend Analyzer. Analyzers which care about reuse and are fine w/ ReusingAnalyzer's impl, can move to extend it. And Analyzers that care about reuse but want their reuse to be done differently can choose to extend ReusingAnalyzer, or Analyzer.\n\nBack-compat wise, we're safe since:\n\n\tExisting Lucene Analyzers that reuse can be changed to extend ReusingAnalyzer.\n\tExisting Analyzers (outside Lucene code) either override or not reusableTokenStream, and therefore won't break.\n\tOur indexing code will still call reusableTokenStream, no change here.\n\tAny code out there which traverses an Analyzer by calling reusableTokenStream does not need to change anything.\n\n\n\nI think that'd work?
