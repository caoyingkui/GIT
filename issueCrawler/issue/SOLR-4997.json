That is by design and we're not going to change that.",

The last one required invasive changes.\n\nI'll put up this patch in case someone wants to review and commit it tomorrow morning my time (IST).\n\nI'd like to include this in 4.4 since it fixes major bugs but I'm not sure if we have enough time to let this bake.
