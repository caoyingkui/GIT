A user can create an index with one soft-deletes field then open an IW with another field or add an index with a different soft-deletes field. This should not be allowed and reported the error to users as soon as possible.",

Michael McCandless indicated he want's to use it and I suspect the usecase is becoming more widely adopted we can be more strict about it and make it a non-expert feature. The fact that it's just a DV field is great and under the hood not many changes were necessary. The overhead of tracking this is small in my opinion and enforcing this would allow us to make the feature much less trappy down the road. ie. factory methods can automatically wrap indices that have a soft-deletes field, we can track the numSoftDeletes which helps a ton with assertions and allows to pull index stats by reading seginfos alone without opening a reader. I can work around all these thing and I am not even convinced we should do automatically wrapping a reader etc. but we can make this feature easy to use with a simple setter on IWC. From a interface perspective it's simple and the changes necessary to make it way less trappy warrent the change. I wonder what others think. ",

Like you can only have a soft_deletes field if you mark it as such from the very beginning ie. as soon as you introduce it.\n\n ",
