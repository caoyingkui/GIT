    "description": "text or string field type constantly have some character might confilct with xml specification, especially for DBCS language data. In my case and experience, I always add CDATA around the contents of  string or text fileds may contains Chinese  contents. This will always any pass xml parsers. But I see xml-format result set of Solr 5.4.1 doesn't do this by default. The result set would have high possibility that it will not pass the xml parsers. I think CDATA for text/string fields should be a requisite. Better provide a patch ASAP. You can't only consider english contents cause they are not DBCS.",
