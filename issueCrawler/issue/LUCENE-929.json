    "description": "The contrib/benchmark build does not properly handle checking to see if the content (such as Reuters coll.) is properly extracted.  It only checks to see if the directory exists.  Thus, it is possible that the directory gets created and the extraction fails.  Then, the next time it is run, it skips the extraction part and tries to continue on running the benchmark.\n\nThe workaround is to manually delete the extraction directory.",

            "content": "I didn't find a way to check if an Ant directory is empty, and even if there is a way, the extract process can still fail in the middle. So maybe an alternative solution is to extract the files in ExtractReuters to a tmp directory first, and rename it if everything succeeds. Also, always delete the target dir at startup. That way, if extraction fails, the directory doesn't exist, and if it does exist, we know it's ok (unless manually tempered, but that's not for us to solve).\n\nWhat do you think? ",

If the target exists, the code should fail - we're not supposed to call it from Ant anyway, and so if it's indeed called, it may discover a bug in the build.xml, and if it's called by a standalone program, I think it'd be better to fail so as to indicate the caller that the dir exists - maybe he'll want to delete and re-create it.
