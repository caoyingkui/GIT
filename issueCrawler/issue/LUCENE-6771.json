    "description": "NTFS has a state for a file called \"pending delete\", where a delete was tried (\"succeeded\", if the files was opened with shared access), but if there were still open file handles on that file, the file is in \"pending delete\" state where it is listed in the directory but cannot be written, read nor deleted.\n\nUwe Schindler suggested WindowsFS should try to emulate this too, and I agree: it would maybe have made it easier to repro some recent Windows-only test failures.\n\nSee the comment on LUCENE-6684 for more details...",
