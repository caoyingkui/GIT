    "description": "Hi,\n\nwe are using a DIH via JDBC to index documents out of our database. Due to our design, this full import is/can be executed entity per entity. We are using a http request out of .Net client to execute these imports.\n\nIf we execute requests (multiple full imports) very fast, Solr accepts the request but the import is not executed. In such a case the following log entry is visible:\n\n2017-05-11 13:28:10.317 INFO  (qtp1654589030-16) [   x:iET] o.a.s.c.S.Request [iET]  webapp=/solr path=/dataimport params=\n{connectionString=jdbc:sqlserver://...&clean=false&user=sa&version=2.2&command=full-import&entity=ts2_it_change_text_search}\n status=0 QTime=0\n\nThat's all for this entity. We stumbled over this entry because the QTime=0.\n\nWhereas a successfull import produces entries like this:\n\n2017-05-11 13:28:10.298 INFO  (qtp1654589030-14) [   x:iET] o.a.s.c.S.Request [iET]  webapp=/solr path=/dataimport params=\n{connectionString=jdbc:sqlserver://...&clean=false&user=sa&version=2.2&command=full-import&entity=ts1_it_change_text_search}\n status=0 QTime=15\n...\n2017-05-11 13:28:10.339 INFO  (Thread-16) [   x:iET] o.a.s.h.d.JdbcDataSource Creating a connection for entity ts1_it_change_text_search with URL: jdbc:sqlserver://...\n...\n2017-05-11 13:28:10.715 INFO  (Thread-16) [   x:iET] o.a.s.u.p.LogUpdateProcessorFactory [iET]  webapp=/solr path=/dataimport params=\n{connectionString=jdbc:sqlserver://...&clean=false&user=sa&version=2.2&command=full-import&entity=ts1_it_change_text_search}\n status=0 QTime=15\n{add=[82628015d12ac6be (1567106573943177216), 3f314c79dd29634f (1567106573948420096), 37e6a5139ac7640d (1567106573950517248), 6b44fa32c4aee1b4 (1567106573952614400), f5695f69c3aac089 (1567106573954711552), 7a34e505265071ce (1567106573956808704), b2729ff2de7d3b8e (1567106573958905856), b92b779c74481ef0 (1567106573963100160), 5d42a3619ddc50fd (1567106573967294464), 9793b2036f2491db (1567106573969391616), ...

Or do you have any idea what we are doing wrong?\n\nThx\nTorsten",

It is not design for that, as it runs asynchronously. However, I believe that if you have several request handlers (in solrconfig.xml) for DIH, you can invoke them in parallel. They can share the same configuration file. \n\nI would try that first. ",
