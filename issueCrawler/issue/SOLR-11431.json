    "description": "When leader candidate does PeerSync to all replicas, to download any missing updates, it is tolerant to failures. It uses cantReachIsSuccess=true switch which handles connection issue, 404 and 503 as success, since replicas being DOWN should not affect the process.\n\nHowever, if a replica has disk issues, the core initialization might fail and that results in 500 instead of 503. I failing replica like that can prevent any other replicas becoming the leader.\n\nProposing either:\n\n\tAccepting 500 as \"cant reach\" so leader candidate can go on\nor\n\tChanging SolrCoreInitializationException to return 503 instead of 500\n\t* this might be API change, however",
