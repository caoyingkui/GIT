    "description": "We made good efforts in order to make index sorting fast and easy to configure. We should now look into making IndexSearcher aware of it. This will probably require changes of the API as not collecting all matches means that we can no longer know things like the total number of hits or the maximum score.\n\nI don't plan to work on it anytime soon, I'm just opening this issue to raise awareness. I'd be happy to do reviews however if someone decides to tackle it.",
