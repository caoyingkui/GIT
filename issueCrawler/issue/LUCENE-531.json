    "description": "If you generate an index somewhere on the filesystem in location DIR and later on\nadd some other (not index-related) directories to DIR, then loading that index using\nFSDirectory will succeed. However, if you then attempt to load that index into\nRAM using RAMDirectory API, RAMDirectory constructor will throw an exception\nbecause it assumes that FSDirectory will return a list of files residing in DIR. The\nproblem with the trunk is that FSDirectory.list() implementation does not check\nfor extraneous entities in the index directory, hence breaking RAMDirectory\nconstruction.\n\nI encountered this issue because I started storing some of my tiny indexes under\nversion control. Loading these indexes using RAMDirectory fails because of\nthe CVS/subversion directories (.svn/.cvs) which are created within the index\ndirectories.",

The patch includes\nthe following:\n\n       (1) Safer implementation of FSDirectory.list()\n       (2) A test case in org/apache/lucene/index/store/TestRAMDirectory.java\n\nCurrent trunk build and tests pass successfully using this patch. Note that the patch is still\nnot very satisfactory because, in theory, it would be nice if FSDirectory returned only the\nvalid Lucene index files.\n\n\n\n ",
