    "description": "Javadocs for Scorer.java and TermScorer.java \nAlso changed build.xml to use package access for the \njavadocs target. That caused some minor error javadoc messages \nin CompoundFileReader.java and FieldInfos.java, which are also fixed. \n\nThe patch posted earlier for Weight.java \n(a broken javadoc link) is also included. \n\nThe attached patch is for all 5 files against the CVS top directory \nof 28 July 2004. The only dependency is that package access \nis needed for TermScorer.java. \n\nThis might be changed by declaring TermScorer as a public class, \nbut I preferred to use javadoc package access in build.xml \nover changing java code. \n\nUsing package access for javadocs shows some more undocumented \nclasses, eg. in the doc page of the search package. This might \nencourage folks to write more javadocs... \n\nRegards, \nPaul",

Classes methods and\nfields which are not public should not be in the API documentation.  Perhaps we\ncould have a separate javadoc target (javadocs-internal, or somesuch) that shows\npackage and even private stuff, for use by developers, but the primary javadoc\nshould only show the public APIs.
