The default is typically 51,200 but for the UnifiedHighlighter and PostingsHighlighter it's 10,000. This could easily lead to an unexpected lack of highlights that you expect to see when trying the UH.",

I see you noticed I didn't add a test   I'll go add one if you insist; though I don't think every option out there deserves a test, particularly at the Solr layer for where there is a Lucene capability.
