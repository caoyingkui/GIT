After this time is exceeded, the search thread is stopped, partial results (if any) are returned and the total number of results is estimated.\n\nThis patch tries to minimize the overhead related to time-keeping by using a version of safe unsynchronized timer.\n\nThis was also discussed in an e-mail thread.\nhttp://www.nabble.com/search-timeout-tf3410206.html#a9501029",

A single thread should be created to be used for all searches.\n\nModified Files:\nHits.java\n\n    Added partial result flag.\n\nIndexSearcher.java\n\n    Catches TimeLimitedCollector.TimeExceeded, sets partial results flag on TopDocs and estimates the total hit count (if we hadn't timed out partway through).  Returns TopDocs with partial results.\n\nSearcher.java\n\n    Added methods to set and get the timeout parameters.  This implementation decision has the limitation of only permitting a single timeout value per Searcher instance (of which there is usually only one).  However, this greatly minimizes the number of search methods that would need to be added.  In practice, I have not needed the functionality to change the timeout settings on a per query basis.\n\nTopFieldDocCollector.java\n\n    Uses TimeLimitedCollector functionality.\n\nTopDocCollector.java\n\n    Uses TimeLimitedCollector functionality and exposes it to child class TopFieldDocCollector.\n\nTopDocs.java\n\n    Added partial results flag.  Note, TopFieldDocs extends this class and inherits the new functionality. ",

Not so simple.\n\nI think my preference for the API and implementation would be in HitCllector.collect() - in other words, we consider this new feature as an advanced one, and so only allow applications to provide their \"timed\" hitCollector. The modified collect() would either throw a TimeoutException or return a timedOut indication. If this is a (subclass of) RunTimeException (thuogh I am not crazy about this alternative) then there's no API change (a plus) but we need to verify that the code below propagates the RuntimeException gracefully and closes all the streams and everything (which I believe it does with all last careful changes by Mike and Michael). If RuntimeEXception is not acceptable, then this is an API change (a minus) and also many (simple) changes will be required in scorers (callers to collect). \n\nThe application's timedColletor will have all the logic in that collector for both announcing and detecting the timeout. Next we can add a TimedCollector for the benefit of applications, and last, consider adding search() methods with timeOut, but I doubt that last step. ",

The point is that if a search is going to find 14 million hits, Google does not go and tally them. It stops quickly and estimates how many might remain.

However, there is simply no justification to change TopDocCollector, TopFieldDocCollector, Topdocs, Hits and Searcher. There's a MUCH simpler, and in my opinion cleaner, approach: Just make TimeLimitedCollector be a front-end for another collector (for example, TopDocCollector) which will be passed to TimeLimitedCollector's constructor. For every document that is presented to TimeLimitedCollector's collect(), it would call the inner collector's collect().\n\nThis way, without any changes to Lucene's core APIs, and just the addition of a new class, you can add the new functionality that you wanted. This, I think, is the beauty of the HitCollector interface over the \"monolithic\" Hits approach, and I think we should encourage this way of thinking instead of adding more and more features to Hits.

This is going to take an amount of time that is linear in the size of the index but no document will be collected.\n\nThis means that every conjunction (boolean queries with more than one required clause, phrase queries, span near queries) will need to check for timeout.

I agree nanoTime is the correct implementation when using 1.5.\n\nIt doesn't seem like on Linux running ntp it matters much either way.  NTP tries to perform smoothing and makes clock changes slowly over a longer period of time when it can rather than have an abrupt change, but YMMV if your system is having clock issues.  On a really overloaded Windows box, the TimerThread implementation will not behave well as demonstrated above.  I can't speak to any other platforms. ",

I haven't seen any performance issues with System.currentTimeMillis().\n\nAs far as 200ms, I think that is too large of a default resolution (and with the current implementation it is not configurable).  With a 200 ms resolution, a query with a 1 second time allowed could timeout in 800 ms, and one with a time allowed of 500 ms could timeout in 300 ms.  I think it is much worse to timeout a query early than to timeout late. ",

In the attached N_THREADS = 50 and this number of threads always passes for me.\n\nIf there are no more major concerns I think this is now ready to go in, question is where to - under core o.a.l.search or under contrib (query or misc). \nOthers?
