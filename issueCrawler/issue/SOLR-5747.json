            "content": "This would be a nice feature, but making it happen by default seems like a bad idea to me.  It would result in a considerable change to Solr's default behavior.  If we make it configurable and don't turn it on by default, I think it would be nice to have.\n\nRight now you can make a change to your config in zookeeper, and it won't take effect until you CHOOSE to make it take effect, by reloading manually.  If you have several thousand collections all using the same config, you definitely don't want thousands of cores to reload, even if it were to happen one-by-one instead of all at once. "

            "content": "I'd agree with Shawn/Mark, for a large production system, having it automatically pick up new configuration feels positively dangerous.  Our production systems need more fine-grained control over when replicas are reloaded, so operationally, we upload new config, and then restart parts of the cloud piece by piece.  This also reduces our load on ZK (we have 1024 cores, so it they all receive a watch at the same time, and start pulling config, its a non-trivial load on ZK, and the poor old Overseer gets swamped!)\n\nI can understand automatic deployment in a development system (definitely easier I grant you), or maybe small-scale production (depends what rollout/backout you have to handle) but seems more of a nice to have than important.  But I guess it depends on your use case. "

The manual reload is last keeper that if automatic doesn't work. "
