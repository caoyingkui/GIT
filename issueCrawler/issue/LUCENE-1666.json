It just uses LucenePackage to get the implementation information. If it is NULL (because no manifest), it uses the same algorithm for resolving like you proposed. ",

Googling, it seems there are some occasions where .getPackage() might return null (seems to be w/ custom classloaders).\n\nAnd.... are there any situations where .getPackage() would fail but the current way would work (and vice/versa)?  (This is all voodoo magic to me!). ",
