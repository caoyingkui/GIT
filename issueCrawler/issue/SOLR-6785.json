    "description": "The wiki for UpdateCSV (which also presumably applies to the CSV response writer) states: \"If an escape is specified, the encapsulator is not used unless also explicitly specified since most formats use either encapsulation or escaping, not both.\" That makes a lot of sense. However,  the fix for SOLR-3959 makes it so that polyfields are always escaped, even when enscapsulation is enabled. Are we sure that SOLR-3959 was even a bug in the first place? Why should commas in the output of polyfields be treated any differently than commas elsewhere? One possible enhancement to the interface would be to use \"\\\" as the separator by default when encapsulation is disabled, but I propose starting by reverting the \"fix\" for SOLR-3959.",
