    "description": "This was a nice crutch for tons of expensive per-document methods, but its no longer needed anymore. After LUCENE-7147 these are truly only boundary cases and we aren't doing a ton of per doc checks anymore. See LUCENE-7212 for inspiration.\n\nThe extra bitset needed, 64-bit docvalues fetch, etc, this cost is no longer worth it.",
