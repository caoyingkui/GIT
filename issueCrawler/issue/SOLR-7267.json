    "description": "As noted by Eduard Moraru on the solr-user list:\n\n\n\tthe solr example configs use the naming convention of \"cz\" for Czech language related field types (both in the dynamicField, fieldType, and stopwords file name)\n\tthe ISO langauge code for Czech is actaully \"cs\" \u2013 \"cz\" is the country code for the Czech Republic, but it is not a standard language code.\nbut what we are really wondering now is why does Lucene/Solr use \"cz\"\n(country code) instead of \"cs\" (language code) in both its \"text_cz\" field\nand its \"stopwords_cz.txt\" file?\n\n\n\nIs that a mistake on the Solr/Lucene side? Is it some kind of convention? Is it going to be fixed?",
