    "description": "I'm using Solr-1.3 trunk and I have http caching headers enabled.  Some of my interactions with solr using my browser (Firefox) such as using the multicore features to reload a module were return so quick that I was suspicious that it did anything.  It turns out that it was caching the reload command and it didn't really do anything.  I think the http caching headers should only be applied to search result queries and no other URLs for SOLR.",
