    "description": "This patch enables indexed cells to be differentiated between those that are completely within the shape that was indexed, and those on the edge (intersects, not within) but reached a precision threshold.  The point of this  differentiation is to be used by the two-phase optimized predicates in LUCENE-5579 to be able to avoid an expensive geometry check for accuracy, in more cases than it is able to without this differentiation.  In particular, if the query shape is within an indexed shape, then this cell differentiation will enable a predicate to observe that without doing a geometry check.\n\nnote: patch here is moved from LUCENE-5579 as this is really an add-on",

But I think this issue overall should wait until LUCENE-5579 as that will make this easier to test and of course we can observe the benefit to this cell differentiation that we trade-off in index size and some complexity.
