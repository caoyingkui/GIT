    "description": "Since flexible indexing, terms are now represented as byte[], but for backwards compatibility reasons, they are not sorted as byte[], but instead as if they were char[].\n\nI think its time to look at sorting terms as byte[]... this would yield the following improvements:\n\n\tterms are more opaque by default, they are byte[] and sort as byte[]. I think this would make lucene friendlier to customizations.\n\tnumerics and collation are then free to use their own encoding (full byte) rather than avoiding the use of certain bits to remain compatible with char[] sort order.\n\tautomaton gets simpler because as in LUCENE-2265, it uses byte[] too, and has special hacks because terms are sorted as char[]",
