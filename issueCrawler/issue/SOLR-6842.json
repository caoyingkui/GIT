    "description": "As a user, I'd like to be able to specify more precise term-matching by surrounding a term with double quotes. To support this, we need to be able to supply a different set of fields for phrases than for bare terms. Specifically, we'd like to treat phrases as more \"exact\" - probably turning off stemming and generally having a tighter analysis chain.\n\nI have a working implementation now that is a quite small, built as an extension of ExtendedDismaxQParser and friends.  If there's interest, I can do the work to merge the small changes in with the existing classes.  Basically my idea was to create a parallel set of Aliases for a dummy default phrase-field (named IMPOSSIBLE_PHRASE_FIELD_NAME), and then to use that for user-supplied phrases when there are aliases present, instead of the current default.  I would propose to name the new field \"pqf\" - - \"phrase query fields\", by analogy to \"qf\".
