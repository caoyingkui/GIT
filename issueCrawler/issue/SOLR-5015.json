    "description": "Currently, the shards.info section of a SolrCloud query response uses \"the | delimited list of equivalent servers\" of the available servers for the shard keys in the response, rather than the shard IDs (names?.)\n\nMy first preference would be for the shard IDs to be used for the shards.info keys, and then the list of servers could be a \"servers\" key value at the next level down in the response. But if compatibility is important, continue to use the server list as the keys for shards.info, and then add \"shardID\" or \"shardName\" as a key at the next level down in the response.\n\nFor example, instead of:\n\n\n  \"shards.info\":{\n    \"207.237.114.232:8984/solr/collection1/|207.237.114.232:8986/solr/collection1/\":{\n      \"numFound\":2,\n      \"maxScore\":1.0,\n      \"time\":224},\n    \"207.237.114.232:8983/solr/collection1/|207.237.114.232:8985/solr/collection1/\":{\n      \"numFound\":8,\n      \"maxScore\":1.0,\n      \"time\":898}},\n\n\n\nMy first choice would be:\n\n  \"shards.info\":{\n    \"shard2\": {\n      \"servers\": \"207.237.114.232:8984/solr/collection1/|207.237.114.232:8986/solr/collection1/\",\n      \"numFound\":2,\n      \"maxScore\":1.0,\n      \"time\":224},\n    \"shard1\": {\n      \"servers\": \"207.237.114.232:8983/solr/collection1/|207.237.114.232:8985/solr/collection1/\",\n      \"numFound\":8,\n      \"maxScore\":1.0,\n      \"time\":898}},\n\n\n\nAnd my second choice would be:\n\n\n  \"shards.info\":{\n    \"207.237.114.232:8984/solr/collection1/|207.237.114.232:8986/solr/collection1/\":{\n      \"shardName\": \"shard2\",\n      \"numFound\":2,\n      \"maxScore\":1.0,\n      \"time\":224},\n    \"207.237.114.232:8983/solr/collection1/|207.237.114.232:8985/solr/collection1/\":{\n      \"shardName\": \"shard1\",\n      \"numFound\":8,\n      \"maxScore\":1.0,\n      \"time\":898}},\n\n\n\n(We don't have shard \"name\", but I presume that at some point we will. For now, it would just be the shard ID.)\n\nI suppose the second choice might be better for non-cloud traditional distributed Solr - where there is no shard ID/name.",

And also, the list of servers becomes an array instead of a string with some internal parsing required (separated by |).\n\nLastly, (though this could be a separate issue), it would be nice if shards.info indicated which server out of the list it actually went to? Currently the response indicates the results come from shard1 and shard2 and which possible servers could have generated those responses.  It would be nice (for monitoring load and checking timings) to see which of these 2 servers actually supplied the results for this query.  We could use that to check timing issues/load spikes on a particular replica of a shard.\n\nI appreciate that shards.info pre-dates SolrCloud, and in that (Solr 3.x) world the client dictated which servers to to go, but in the Cloud world, Solr can load-balance itself, so it would be nice to see where it is sending requests for monitoring purposes. Maybe we need a new cloud-aware parameter (e.g. \"replicas.info\"), that wouldn't suffer any backward compatibility issues? "
