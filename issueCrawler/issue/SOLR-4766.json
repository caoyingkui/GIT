Thanks.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\nI wonder if comparing file sizes will cause problems.  When I tried a ways back to institute checks for identical artifacts, I ran into problems with differing timestamps in archive metadata; that is, since the build creates the same artifact multiple times, even though their contents are identical, their metadata isn't.  It's possible that metadata differences will change file sizes.\n\nThe real fix here is to change the build so that any given artifact is only built once when producing a release.  This is not just an issue for the Maven artifacts - the Solr .war includes lucene .jars that are built separately from the Lucene release .jars. "
