    "description": "Currently distance measures are instantiated by passing the name of the distance measure to a function, for example the knn\u00a0function can be passed the named parameter: distance=\"manhattan\".\u00a0\n\nThis ticket will create a specific function for each distance measure which will be used to specify which distance measure to apply. With this design the knn\u00a0function would be passed the function: manhattan() or any of the other distance measure functions.\n\nSample syntax:\n\nknn(a, b, manhattan())\n\nor\n\ndbscan(a, haversineMeters())",
