Deprecated the old constructors.\n\tAdded constructor to ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer which does not take a Version and deprecated the old constructor.\n\tRemoved TEST_VERSION_CURRENT.  Replaces with Version.LATEST where necessary, or just used an alternate function/ctor that didn't take Version.\n\tRemoved FacetExamples.java.  It's only member, EXAMPLES_VER, was not used.\n\tRemoved all :Post-Release-Update-Version: notes. Many were already dead comments, and the rest could be replaced either with Version.CURRENT, or have version removed from the example.\n\n ",

Currently all the Tokenizer/TokenFilterFactories that require the matchVersion property in the map complain.\n\nIn 5.0 and trunk we wanted to use Version.LATEST by default, so we should change AbstractAnalysisFactory to use this constant as default, too (instead of NULL). The assureMatchVersion call is then obsolete, because it should always be non-null.\n\nI will post a patch that fixes this. ",
