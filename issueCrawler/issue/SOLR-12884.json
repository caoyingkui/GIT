    "description": "One of the conference attendees noted that\u00a0you go to the schema browser and click on, say, a pint field, then click \"load term info\", nothing is shown.\n\nadmin/luke similarly doesn't show much interesting, here's the response for a pint .vs. a tint field:\n\n\"popularity\":{ \"type\":\"pint\", \"schema\":\"I-SD----OF-----\"},\n\n\"popularityt\":\n{ \"type\":\"tint\", \"schema\":\"I-S------OF------\",\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"index\":\"-TS--------------\", \"docs\":15}\n,\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat, if anything, should we do in these two cases? Since\u00a0 the points-based numerics don't have terms like Trie* fields, I don't think we can show much more so the above makes sense, it's just jarring to end users and looks like a bug.\n\nWDYT about putting in some useful information though. Say for the Admin UI for points-based \"terms cannot be shown for points-based fields\" or some such?",
