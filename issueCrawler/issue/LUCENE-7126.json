    "description": "This query currently takes minimum and maximum range and rewrites to a boolean query of two distance queries (big NOT little).\n\nThe problem is, this rewrite is not correct if a document has multiple values in the field.\n\nDo we really need to support this query? What is the use case? Is it a relic of people doing things like pagination or distance faceting in a very slow way? We can do these things more efficiently with other mechanisms (e.g. distance sort for LatLonPoint works well with searchAfter, can be ported to geopoint).",

I was going to update the GeoAPIs to accept a min/max to solve this, but I agree, this just adds unnecessary complexity. +100 for removing it and accomplishing the doughnut search using a distance sort.
