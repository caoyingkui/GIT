An example use might be a query that returns a list of books where ANY 2\npeople from a list of people were co-authors, eg:\n\"Lucene In Action\" would match (\"Erik Hatcher\" \"Otis Gospodneti\u0107\" \"Mark Harwood\"\n\"Doug Cutting\") with a minRequiredOverlap of 2 because Otis and Erik wrote that.\nThe book \"Java Development with Ant\" would not match because only 1 element in\nthe list (Erik) was selected.\n\n2) CustomQueryParserExample\nA customised QueryParser that allows definition of\nCoordConstrainedBooleanQueries. The solution (mis)uses fieldnames to pass\nparameters to the custom query.",

Consider the following nesting scenerio...\n\n   ( (A B X) (C D Y) (E W Z) )\n\nIf document #42 matches A, B, C, D, and E, but does NOT match X, Y or Z, then it will easily match this query.  Even if all of the subqueries are modified so that minNrShouldMatch=2, the result set will be the same \u2013 but the score for document#42 SHOULD be different, because it no longer matches enough individual clauses in the third sub query to get a score contribution from it (ie: the match on E no longer improves the score)\n\nBut, if all you do is set minNrShouldMatch > 0 on the outermost query ...
