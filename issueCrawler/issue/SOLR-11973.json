    "description": "Not quite sure whether this qualifies as something for Solr or Lucene....\n\nI'm working gradually on getting precommit lint warnings out of the code base. I'd like to selectively fail a subtree once it's clean. I played around a bit with Robert's suggestions on the dev list but couldn't quite get it to work, then decided I needed to focus on one thing at a time.\n\nSee SOLR-10809 for the first clean directory Real Soon Now.\n\nBonus points would be working out how to fail on deprecation warnings when building Solr too, although that's farther off in the future.\n\nAssigning to myself, but anyone who knows the build ins and outs please feel free to take it!",
