I don't think we need more of these to block a release, instead this should be an area of continual improvement.\n\nFor example, we added \"fail on javadocs warnings\" to the build instead of \"verify there are no javadocs warnings manually\".

Far, far from it.\n\nAlso, I don't like the drive to formality this seems to represent - I understand what defines an acceptable release candidate - 3 PMC +1's. Shebam!\n\nWe should just make more targeted improvement JIRA's as needed/motivated. Growth does not need to mean more formality by default. Please gods... ",
