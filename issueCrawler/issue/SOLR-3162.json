Additionally we would need the functionality as a handler/servlet-thingy ...\n\nThis is where the, tada, VelocityResponseWriter could really help here.  Rather than raw data having to come from Ajax calls, through a Velocity template you can get at pretty much anything from the SolrCore and configuration, and then use that to generate a response (even, say, an \"x = '$whatever'\" kinda variable into JavaScript.  For example:\n\n\nnever304 = $request.core.solrConfig.httpCachingConfig.never304\n\n\n\nYou could get this using an out of the box request like this: http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=*:*&wt=velocity&v.template=foo&v.template.foo=never304%20=%20$request.core.solrConfig.httpCachingConfig.never304 (though of course I'd recommend templates be created from this under conf/velocity rather than passed in via the request).  The point is, everything can be gathered when you're \"inside\" Solr, but requires explicit exposing of these inner details to make the data available cleanly for this Ajax-the-data-generate-UI-in-JavaScript approach.\n "
