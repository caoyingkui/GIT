    "description": "Now I'm write a plugin for SOLR to highlight custom user data\n\nie my application send to handler on Solr set of documents to highlight in xml format\n\nhandler parse xml, create list of Document (not Lucene object just my abstraction which content Map<fieldName,fieldValue>\nit's enough to properly highlight fields)\n\nSo I'm think  you can change SolrHighlighter:\n\npublic NamedList<Object> doHighlighting(DocList docs, Query query, SolrQueryRequest req, String[] defaultFields) \nto\npublic NamedList<Object> doHighlighting(List<Document> docs, Query query, SolrQueryRequest req, String[] defaultFields) \n\nor create some type of provider to retrieve list of abstract Document's\n\nand Highlighter will be more reusable",

If not, I'm tempted to mark this as Won't Fix in a few days unless somebody speaks up and says a change like this makes sense and is doable. "
