    "description": "trying to wrap my head around a weird bug in my experiements with SOLR-445, i realized that DUP.processDelete has a direct call to finish().\n\nThis violates the normal lifecycle of an UpdateProcessor (finish is only suppose to be called exactly once after processing any/all UpdateCommands) and could potentially break any UpdateProcessors configured after DUP (or in my case: processors configured before DUP that expect to be in charge of calling finish, and catching any resulting exceptions, as part of the normal life cycle)\n\nIndependent of how it impacts other update processors, this also means that:\n\n\tall the logic in DUP.doFinish is getting executed twice \u2013 which seems kind of expensive/dangerous to me since there is leader initiated recovery involved in this method\n\tSolrCmdDistributor.finish() gets called twice, which means StreamingSolrClients.shutdown() gets called twice, which means ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.close() gets called twice ... it seems like we're just getting really lucky that (as configured by DUP) all of these resources are still usable after being finished/shutdown/closed",

            "content": "\nI suspect that the intended goal here (in processCommit) is to do the same sort of \"force sequential ordering\" type logic as doDeleteByQuery \u2013 in which case we can/should replace the call to finish() with a call to cmdDistrib.finish() ... except that i'm still concerned about shutdown/closing of clients done by that method, and wonder if both processCommit & processDelete should be calling SolrCmdDistributor.blockAndDoRetries() directly? (we would just need to make that method public)\n\nHoping folks like Mark Miller / Timothy Potter might have some ideas about this? ",
