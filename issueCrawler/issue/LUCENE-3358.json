    "description": "Lucene 3.3 (possibly 3.1 onwards) exhibits less than great behaviour for tokenising hiragana, if combining marks are in use.\n\nHere's a unit test:\n\n\n    @Test\n    public void testHiraganaWithCombiningMarkDakuten() throws Exception\n    {\n        // Hiragana 'S' following by the combining mark dakuten\n        TokenStream stream = new StandardTokenizer(Version.LUCENE_33, new StringReader(\"\\u3055\\u3099\"));\n\n        // Should be kept together.\n        List<String> expectedTokens = Arrays.asList(\"\\u3055\\u3099\");\n        List<String> actualTokens = new LinkedList<String>();\n        CharTermAttribute term = stream.addAttribute(CharTermAttribute.class);\n        while (stream.incrementToken())\n        {\n            actualTokens.add(term.toString());\n        }\n\n        assertEquals(\"Wrong tokens\", expectedTokens, actualTokens);\n\n    }\n\n\n\nThis code fails with:\n\njava.lang.AssertionError: Wrong tokens expected:<[\u3056]> but was:<[\u3055]>\n\n\n\nIt seems as if the tokeniser is throwing away the combining mark entirely.\n\n3.0's behaviour was also undesirable:\n\njava.lang.AssertionError: Wrong tokens expected:<[\u3056]> but was:<[\u3055, \u3099]>\n\n\n\nBut at least the token was there, so it was possible to write a filter to work around the issue.\n\nKatakana seems to be avoiding this particular problem, because all katakana and combining marks found in a single run seem to be lumped into a single token (this is a problem in its own right, but I'm not sure if it's really a bug.)",

(I will still wait for 3.4 because it will make backwards-compat much simpler.)\n\nI am aware of the Unicode word breaking rules and read the standard through, which is where I discovered that the non-breaking of Katakana was part of the standard (which is why I haven't filed it as a bug or improvement about that as well.)  It is very unfortunate that the Unicode Consortium somehow ended up with a rule which is, quite frankly, undesirable. When I brought the change up with Japanese users, they were 100% against that behaviour, so it's a wonder that the standard got past the Japanese without any objections (I am, of course, assuming that they actually consulted an expert in the language.)  But breaking it up as a separate filter isn't so hard.  It's only a single Unicode area with few combining marks, so the logic is not that difficult and StandardTokenizer even marks the token as katakana for us. ",

When using title-only queries, the Okapi model provided the best\nmean average precision of 0.2972 (bigram on Kanji only) compared to 0.2873 when\ngenerating bigrams on both Kanji and Katakana. This difference is rather small, and is even\nsmaller in the opposite direction for long queries (0.3510 vs. 0.3523). Based on these results\nwe cannot infer that for the Japanese language one indexing procedure is always significantly\nbetter than another.\n\n\n\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.111.6738 ",
