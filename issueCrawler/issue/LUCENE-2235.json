            "content": "Hi Nick,\nthanks for reporting this. Your problem only occurs since the missing method was added (before PFAW only returned some default, now it throws NPE) in that case.\n\nIn general, Lucene does not support null analyzers anywhere (not as ctor argument in IW/IWC) or e.g. here. You should always add a \"simple\" analyzer to IndexWriter (WhitespaceAnalyzer, SimpleAnalyzer, KeywordAnalyzer) or other methods taking Analyzer.\n\nTo really fix this, we have to review all places that don't need to call Analyzers. There are e.g. other places, like when you directly pass the TokenStream to the Field with \"new Field(name, TokenStream), it also calls the analyzer, so you have to implement it. ",

            "content": "To come back to the original issue:\n\nShould this be checking that a field is indeed analyzed before calling getOffsetGap ?\n\nIn my opinion this should be done (and so this issue would disappear). Can you open another issue requesting this check and link it to this one?\n\nOne problem coming from not checking for \"analyzed\" is this:\nYou add a field indexed and it gets analyzed by PFAW - After that you add the same field name stored-only (which is perfectly legal and often used, e.g. when the stored value is binary or in some other format and does not correspond to the indexed text), the positionIncrement is increased. After that you again add another instance of the same field as indexed-only, which also increases posIncr. So you have 2 times the gap between both indexed sub-fields. This is definitely wrong. ",
