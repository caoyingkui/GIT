    "description": "Right now a replica when first loaded always does recovery (except the replica is the leader). This will lead to several problems, for example: \n\n\tleaderless if at the same time the replica is doing recovery, the current leader goes down.\n\tthe recovery process is not necessary if the replica is already in-sync with the leader\nBy using term value introduced in SOLR-11702 we can skip the recovery process if replica's term equals to leader's term.",
