For example, TermQuery(t) and SpanTermQuery(t) will generate the exact same hash codes.\n\tmix bits between different components that have any hashCode parts in common...\n   for example RangeQuery will produce the same hashCode whenever lowerTerm==upperTerm.\n   Also, field[x TO y] will produce the same hashCode for any field since the fieldname parts of the\n  terms will always cancel eachother out.  This will also cause the hashCode of field\n{x TO x}\n to equal field:x\n  The hashCode of FilteredQuery will also cause many collisions because the bits aren't mixed inbetween\n   the query and the filter.\n  Remember that every query as a boost component... never just xor two query hashCodes together.\n\tmake things position dependent.\n  Currently, field[x TO y] will produce the same hasCode as field[y TO x]... not particularly important for RangeQuery, but\n   you get the idea. \n\tdon't be afraid of using \"\" instead of \"^\".  They both take a single CPU cycle, but \"\" is not quite so easily (accidentally) reversed.\n\tflipping more than a single bit when hashing a boolean might be a good idea - it will make collisions harder.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm is an interesting link on integer hash codes (what we are in effect doing when we combine multiple hash codes).  Esp interesting is the section \"Parallel Operations\" ",

As I find the need to update a hashCode, do you think it's bad form for me to outright replace an existing hashCode implementation you wrote that looks complicated to me with what IntelliJ generates?:  Here's a specific example:\n\nSpanNotQuery formerly:\n\n    int h = include.hashCode();\n    h = (h<<1) | (h >>> 31);  // rotate left\n    h ^= exclude.hashCode();\n    h = (h<<1) | (h >>> 31);  // rotate left\n    h ^= Float.floatToRawIntBits(getBoost());\n    return h;\n\n\n\nIntelliJ will generate a hashCode for this + a new pre & post pair of integer fields I'm adding via LUCENE-5091:\n\n    int result = super.hashCode();\n    result = 31 * result + include.hashCode();\n    result = 31 * result + exclude.hashCode();\n    result = 31 * result + pre;\n    result = 31 * result + post;\n    return result;\n\n\n\nNow that's a hashCode implementation I can understand, and I don't question it's validity because IntelliJ always generates them in a consistent fashion that I am used to seeing.  Your hashCode might be better, but I simply don't understand and thus can't maintain it.  Do you want me to consult you (or an applicable author of a confusing hashCode in general) every time?  Granted this doesn't happen often. ",

There's actually an intrinsic for this (Integer.rotateLeft and rotateRight).\n\nNow which sequence of operations \u2013 the one above or IntelliJ generated one \u2013 is \"better\" is a difficult question to answer \u2013 depends how many collisions you actually get for real life include/exclude pairs. I doubt there'll be many. Multiplications used to be much smaller than bitshifts and logical operations so the first version is probably historically motivated (as being faster). ",

Well... as I've been spending more time investigating, I'm feeling a more comfortable.  I would certainly prefer to see Integer.rotateLeft(31).\n\nI argue for the more maintainable code \u2013 and that's IntelliJ's version.  I also like that it uses super.hashCode(), which leaves the responsibility of including the hashcode of boost, which is where that responsibility should lie.  Of course the approaches are complementary.\n\nMore generally, I'm looking to see if it would be bad form of me to outright replace a hashCode (or equals) method if it suited me, without feeling obliged to consult who coded it in the first place.

IntelliJ's version is based on a common pattern found throughout the JDK \u2013 I am pretty sure it has a common underlying academic source somewhere \n\nIn general implementing equals and hashCode properly (so that the contract of these methods is not violated and the hash code distribution is sensibly random) is not trivial at all so anything that helps you get to the point is probably sensible.\n\n\nInteger.rotateLeft(31)\n\n\n\nThat example is actually a rotateLeft(1) \u2013 you shift one bit to the left (h<<1), then you OR (\"insert\") the leftmost bit shifted to the first bit's position (h>>>31).
