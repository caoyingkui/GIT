    "description": "To support multi-dimensional point fields in Solr, 2 things are needed:\n\n\ta way to index a multi-dimensional point.  Perhaps provide as a comma delimited string.\n\ta way to do a multi-dimensional range query.  Write a new query parser.\n\n\n\nWe ought to do this in a some new FieldType's... one for whole numbers, another for floating point.\n\nOriginal description:\n\nThe release of Apache Solr 6.5.0. has a Highlight that \"PointFields (fixed-width multi-dimensional numeric & binary types enabling fast range search) are now supported\" \u3002\nBut I read the source code of solr 6.6 about point, I didnot find out n dimensional that n bigger than 3.\nIn solr,\n1.LatLonPointSpatialField support 2D using LatLonPoint in lucene\u3002\n2.And IntPointField/LongPointField/FloatPointField/DoublePointField only support 1D, although multi-dimensional point is supported in lucene\u3002\n\nSo i have a quesion that is how to support n dimensional search in solr( n >= 3 )?",

It's filed as a \"New Feature\" \u2013 and indeed this is a new feature (request) since Solr doesn't do it now and it could be enabled to thanks to the low level support in Lucene.  The title & description are perhaps not written as a feature-request, they are worded as a question \u2013 hence your reaction Erick on stylistic points but nonetheless it stands that Solr ought to do this and does not yet.
