    "description": "A query like \nq=:&hl=on&.....\n\ndoesn't attempt to highlight anything, as well it shouldn't. But \nq=field1:*&hl=on&...\n\ndoes try to highlight. Of course it highlights every last term in the highlight fields, and is also very slow. \n\nRe-forming the query as \nq=:&fq=field1:*&hl=on&.... \ngets around the problem and is a better query anyway, but it still seems like trying to highlight in the above case is wrong.\n\nComments from the dev list\n\nJack Krupansky:\nIf you want to add a highlight option to suppress or limit highlighting for wildcard terms (or any multi-term query, including fuzzy query), that would seem reasonable, but I\u2019d hate to lose the highlighting for useful wildcards such as field1:invest*.\n\nMaybe if it was something like &hl.maxMultiTerms=15, that would provide the best of both worlds \u2013 a reasonable default to prevent really slow highlighting, but still give reasonable highlighting in reasonable cases, and give you the ultimate control to completely turn off all multi-term expansion highlighting if you so choose.\n\n\nMe:\nI was mostly thinking of this specific case, but a more general solution makes sense. I can still argue that the case of field:* shouldn't ever try to highlight, but field:some* could, as you say, actually be useful....\n\nMostly I'm drawing attention to the difference between : and field:*. I think we should be consistent across both.\n\nJack:\nCould I subvert your \u201cfix\u201d by writing field1:* as field1:** or field1:?* ?\n\n: is simply a shorthand for \u201cMatchAllDocs\u201d, with no implication that it is referencing any field values, while field1:* is an explicit wildcard query, so they are not really comparable other than at a superficial lexical level.\n\nThat said, somewhere there is a Jira that I filed that attempts to have * treated as a faster filter query for matching all docs that have any value (non-null) in a field. Your proposal makes more sense in that context since it is clear that * is semantically distinct from a true wildcard.\n\nBack to my question above, I think it\u2019s okay if only strict single-asterisk wildcard is covered by your change. Any other wildcard or fuzzy query would continue to behave as before \u2013 although adding my suggested limit on term expansion might still be worthwhile. And I might still argue that your fix should be an option even if the default is as you have suggested.\n\nBut, all these comments should be placed on a Jira!",
