This applies to both when asking for help on solutions I'm not so confident in and when I think there's simply not that much to discuss because the patch/commit is trivial or self-explanatory.\n\nThis particular issue was filed by me a good while ago, it doesn't change anything in terms of existing functionality and it patched a functional hole with means that are neither controversial, nor that difficult to understand. I honestly didn't think it was worth bothering people with requests for reviews of something that is, in essence, a trivial extension of existing code. \n\nObviously you do have the right to speak up if there's something wrong with a commit. And I'm more then willing to revert and reiterate if this is the case. "
