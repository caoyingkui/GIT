    "description": "Solr has apache commons-collections in it's classpath. \n\n*This makes it vulnerable to this security issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-580. \n*The /stream handler uses Java serialization for RPC since Solr 5.1. \n\nThese two combined leave a security hole in Solr that allows arbitrary code to be executed on the server.\n\nThis ticket will comment out the /stream handler from the sample solrconfig.xml's and add a warning to explain the vulnerability.",
