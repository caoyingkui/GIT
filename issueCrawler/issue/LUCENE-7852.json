What about X.Y.1 in (say) 2019, is the end year bumped up again to 2019 or does it stay at 2018 since it is only a bugfix release?\n\n ",

            "content": "More NOTICE-related stuff here: http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html, but no discussion about how to decide about years.\n\nHow to determine the start year for lucene/NOTICE.txt and/or is just an end year sufficient?\n\nAccording to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_notice, \"The copyright notice must also contain the year in which the work was first published (or created)\".  Lucene's CHANGES.txt says the 1.2 RC1 was the first Apache release (previous releases were hosted at Sourceforge), and that happened on 2001-10-02.  I'd argue that this is the first year of publication (as Apache Lucene).\n\nSince each release is a separate publication/creation, I think we should be including both the original date of publication and the current year of the latest release.\n\nIf X.0 is released in (say) 2017 and X.Y is released in (say) 2018, presumably the end year gets bumped up to 2018. What about X.Y.1 in (say) 2019, is the end year bumped up again to 2019 or does it stay at 2018 since it is only a bugfix release?\n\nI think the fact of a release, regardless of major/minor/point type, is sufficient to consider it a distinct publishing/creation act, and so should get its release year included in the copyright notice; in your example, I think X.Y.1's 2019 release should bump the copyright year to 2019.
