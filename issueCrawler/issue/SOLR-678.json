    "description": "The HTMLStripStandardTokenizerFactory filter does not place word boundaries on HTML tags like it should.\n\nFor example, indexing the text \"<h2>title</h2><p>some comment</p>\" results in two words being indexed: \"titlesome\" and \"comment\" when there should be three words: \"title\" \"some\" and \"comment\".\n\nNot all tags need this, for example, it may be perfectly reasonable to write \"<b>sub</b>script\" to be indexed as \"subscript\" since the <b> is interpretted as inline, not block.\n\nI would suggest all block or paragraph tags be translated into spaces so that text on either side of the tag is considered separate tokens. eg: p div h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 br hr pre   (etc)",
