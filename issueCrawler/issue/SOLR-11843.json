This shows up in the admin UI as \"routerField\" and when you enter a value there, the admin UI sends this information in the collections API request as a parameter named routerField ... but it should be sent as \"router.field\" instead.",

I tried a couple of ideas, but the first one completely broke the admin UI and the second one didn't work. ",

Note \"routerField\" rather than \"router.field\" is passed as the parameter name:\n\nreplicationFactor=1&routerName=compositeId&collection.configName=_default&maxShardsPerNode=1&name=eoe&router.name=compositeId&action=CREATE&numShards=1&routerField=blivet...\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the implicit or compositeId field is used.\n\nAnother anomaly is that \"routerName\" is passed as well as \"router.name\".\n\nparams={replicationFactor=1&shards=2&routerName=implicit&collection.configName=default&maxShardsPerNode=1&name=bonkers&router.name=implicit&action=CREATE&numShards=1&routerField=whatever\n\nIn lieu of restructuring the command itself to be consistent by either making\u00a0all parameters camelCase or use the dot.notation, we should make the labels on the text boxes match the real parameter as well as fix what's sent to Solr I should think. Then just pass the correct parameter... ",
