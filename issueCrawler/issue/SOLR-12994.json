It should be something like the search box provided by solr in the reference website. I need some help to guide me through the different steps. I don't understand how it is woking because i have uploaded some json docs to my core and performed a query, but i am not getting any results.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the link i was talking about--\u00a0https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_2/about-this-guide.html",

You can find information about subscribing here: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc.\n\nAs a short answer, however, that is not a search box as you are thinking of it. That is a page title lookup that finds matching keywords in a JSON file that's built when the Ref Guide's static HTML pages are built. It requires Jekyll and Liquid templates to duplicate it, but the source code is available in Solr's source: https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucene-solr.git;a=tree;f=solr/solr-ref-guide;hb=refs/heads/master.\n\nHowever, I think you will be better served by asking other Solr users how they have integrated search into their sites by emailing your question to the solr-user mailing list.
