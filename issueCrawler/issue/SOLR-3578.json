    "description": "Now that aliasing is into the 4x branch (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1205)  I tried to use it with filter queries but it didn't work. Well I could get them to work using local params, however I think that the query parsers should be able to detect the parameterized versions as well.\n\nFor example the query:\n../select?q=a:value&hl=a:field_a&f.a.qf=field_a&defType=dismax&fq=\n{!dismax fl=b:field_b f.b.qf=field_b}\nvalue2\n\nshould be re-written as:\n../select?q=a:value&hl=a:field_a&f.a.qf=field_a&defType=dismax&fq=b:value&fq.fl=b:field_b&fq.f.b.qf=field_b&qf.defType=dismax",

            "content": "i'm having trouble understanding the goal of this request \u2013 largely because things like the \"fl\" param don't make any sense in the context of local params (it doesn't affect query parsing at all \u2013 it's a response formating param)\n\nCould you provide a more details example of what you'd like to see work?  ideally in the form of a unit test, but at a minimum something that people could try using the example data (ie: show a URL with fields used in the example, and then show an example of what results you'd like to see using the docs in the example) "
