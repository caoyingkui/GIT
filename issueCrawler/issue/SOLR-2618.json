    "description": "It would be very beneficial for a project that I am currently working on to have the ability to index and search on various subclasses of an object and map the objects directly to the actual domain-object. This functionality exist in Hibernate search for instance. Is this something that future releases have in mind? I would think that this is something that will make the value of Solr more efficient to a lot of users. \n\nWe are testing SolrJ 3.2 with the use of the SolrJ client and the web interface to index change and search. It should be possible to make a solution that map against a special type field(like <field name=\"classtype\" type=\"class\">) in schemas.xml that are indexed every time and use reflection against the actual class?\n\n\n\tMonica",
