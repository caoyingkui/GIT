This looks fine to me. Can you please add javadocs to FC.createBitSet?\n\nBetter not to depend on the bitset, it's better to depend on a more general interface.\n\nWe need to be careful here. Mike and I experimented with cutting the API over to a general DocIdSet, but it hurt the performance of faceted search, even with \"smarter\" bitsets. When we move to a DocIdSet, we add the DocIdSetIterator layer while iterating over the bits which slows down the search ... at least per luceneutil benchmarks. So if we want to do that, we should do it only after proving, by means of benchmarking, that it doesn't hurt performance severely. Would actually be good to show that more compressed bitsets maybe even improve performance, but I would go with the change if the performance-loss is marginal. And we should do it under a separate issue, to not block this one. ",

After getting this in, i can do a separate test on the DocIdSet. See if we can get an acceptable performance for the default behavior without reusing the memory. ",

We were very surprised to see some of the performance implications of saving a method call or changing the order we iterate on results + facet requests. But it's hard to argue w/ consistent numbers, and IIRC they weren't in the 3-5% range, but 10+%. Could be though that we measured several changes at once .. so I think it's worthwhile to benchmark the move to DocIdSet.\n\nAnd yes, it could be OpenBitSetIterator, I don't rule it out.\n\n+1 to allow caching in this issue, we can investigate generalizing the APIs in a separate issue.

This issue was supposed to be about letting you cache the FBS instance.\n\nI don't think we should commit this patch. This issue should allow you to reuse a FixedBitSet. A separate issue should benchmark the move to a more general API. I want to be sure that whatever abstractions that we add do not hurt faceted search, or at least note by how much and why they are worth it. For instance, if we move to a DocIdSet API where none of the Lucene sets improves faceted search over FixedBitSet, I don't think we should do it...\n\nSo John, please revert back to the simple patch w/ the protected method on FacetsCollector (and on trunk-based code) so we can final review and commit it. And please open a separate issue to explore using a DocIdSet in MatchingDocs, instead of FixedBitSet. Thanks! ",

Really, you could do both what this issue wants to achieve and even LUCENE-5428 (IIRC). After Mike wrote a completely bypassing code-path for faceted search and noted some 250% improvements, we decided to eliminate all abstractions from the API, and re-introduce them gradually. Eventually we settled on x4 speedups.\n\nSo I just want to make sure (both here and on LUCENE-5428) that the abstractions that we add don't impact faceted search badly, and if they do and we still want to introduce them, at least show that there's some code path where you actually improve things.\n\nSo please don't take my comments as objections, but just being cautious and this time prefer that whatever abstraction that we add, is measured from all sides.

Lei, I apologize for not mentioning that before, if it wasted your time. It seemed obvious to me .\n\nBut the cut to DocIdSet is bigger than just allowing to reuse FixedBitSet, so why not split the issue to two separate ones anyway? Like, if it turns out that DocIdSet as an abstraction is not bad, but the iterator is, we can always do an instanceof check and execute the more optimized code. So let's just explore all that in a separate issue? Or, if you prefer to do it all in one issue, then we should get luceneutil's blessing here . ",

When you do that, it means the exact same queries are tested each time you run the perf test; if not, it randomly picks a query from the category, and e.g. a category like HighTerm actually has a wide range of queries in it ... so maybe this explains the absolute QPS diffs you see between runs?\n\nSeparately, it's good to open the results files (e.g. /path/to/lucene/benchmark/comp.base.N) to confirm you actually see Date facet counts inside there.\n\nI'll also test the 2nd to last patch w/ Date faceting.

            "content": "Hi Shai:\n\n    Our motivation for generalization also comes from performance: Large index size (e.g. large maxDoc) and very high query throughput. Creating a BitSet of maxDoc bits per query is not feasible. So being able to cache in a thread local would work better (num threads is low due to async nature of our system), which is what the first patch is about.\n\n    If we were to reuse the bitset, we would have to zero out the bits before reuse. We found given our doc size, zeroing out the bitset is expensive, specifically, 4x that of creating the bits in the first place.\n\n   So if we can abstract this out, we can plugin more optimized implementations. We can put together a diciest impl that would perform much better than FixedBitSet.\n\n    Having said this, I am happy to break this into multiple patches/issues.\n\nThanks\n\n-John ",

I will start run some more tests later on when i get time. I actually have an idea now to apply the optimization in general which I thought might only be applied in our case previously. will also test that out, see if we can improve this overall. ",

            "content": "\n\tI implemented FixedBitSet.iterator() to return what I think is a more optimized version, and not OpenBitSetIterator. I also saved nextSetBit two additions in nextSetBit (and the iterator). I think we may want to commit those two changes irrespective of whether we cut over to a general DocIdSet in MatchingDocs.\n\n\n\nI then reviewed the patch more carefully and I noticed a couple of issues, all fixed in this patch:\n\n\n\tFacetsCollector.createHitSet() returned a MutableDocIdSet which uses OpenBitSet and not FixedBitSet internally. This affects .add() too, especially as it used set() and not fastSet(). So I modified it to use FixedBitSet, as the number of bits is known in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\tI moved MutableDocIdSet inside FacetsCollector and changed it to not extend DocIdSet, but rather expose two methods: add() and getDocs(). The latter returns a DocIdSet.\n\t\n\t\tThat way, MatchingDocs doesn't need to declare MutableDocIdSet but DocIdSet, which makes more sense as we don't want the \"users\" of MatchingDocs to be able to modify the doc id set.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tI noticed many places in the code still included a ++doc even though it's not needed anymore, so I removed them.\n\n\n\nI wonder if the 10% loss that Mike saw was related to both the usage of OpenBitSet (which affects collection) and OpenBitSetIterator (which affects accumulation), and how will this patch perform vs trunk. I will try to setup my environment to run the facets benchmark, but Mike, if you can repeat the test w/ this patch and post the results, that would be great. ",
