            "content": "This was actually a fairly bad bug as brought up on the user list a week or two back - the std zk client does not deal with connection loss well, but worse, once it's had a connection expiration, you have to make a new client - you cannot use the old one. So if the distrib queue zk client ever gets expired, it will continually hit expiration exceptions as you try to use it again - so no nodes can publish states (other issues too, but thats a big one). This can put in in an infinite recovery loop. "
