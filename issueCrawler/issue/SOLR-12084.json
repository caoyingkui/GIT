    "description": "When putting ShingleFilter on query analyzer and after some specific query patterns go through Solr, it causes all of handlers thread to hold a\u00a0large amount of SpanNearQuery objects\u00a0and consume all available memory.\n\nMy query analyzer looks like this:\n\n<analyzer type=\"query\">\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<tokenizer class=\"solr.StandardTokenizerFactory\" />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<filter class=\"solr.ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory\" preserveOriginal=\"false\" />\n    <filter class=\"solr.WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\" preserveOriginal=\"0\" />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\" />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<filter class=\"solr.ShingleFilterFactory\" tokenSeparator=\"\" maxShingleSize=\"3\" />\n</analyzer>\n\nAfter I\u00a0tested with queries, it seems that the\u00a0number of terms passing to ShingleFilter\u00a0directly effect Solr memory usage. If ShingleFilter\u00a0got 10-15 terms as input, it takes much memory to process the request, so multiply with concurrent\u00a0make problem goes worse.\n\nNot sure how to handle this problem, maybe we can put an upper limit number of terms produced by ShingleFilter or should we optimize something?\n\nThank you.",
