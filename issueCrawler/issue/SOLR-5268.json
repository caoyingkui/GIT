    "description": "Hi,\n\nUpon installation of Apache Solr 4.4 to Drupal version 6.3.1 , we have encountered an error \n\n\"\nApache Solr: Your site was unable to contact the Apache Solr server\n\"\n\n\nWe have sought assistance from our technician, but to no resolve, the error still persist. We were advised to seek council to the developer of the software. We are hoping that you could further help us with this.\n\nFor more information you can visit this link to solr\nhttp://50.28.38.245:8983/solr/admin\n\nA message from the technician that tried to help us too.\n\n\nHello,\n\nI have copied the solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, and protowords.txt from\n/home/infocuse/public_html/citybay/sites/all/modules/apachesolr/ to\n/home/solr-4.3.1/example/solr/collection1/conf, as according to the module\ninformation page, it needs this information:\n\nhttps://drupal.org/project/apachesolr\n\nHowever, these configuration files appear to not be compatible with this\nversion of Solr. They are missing various configuration sections within the\nsolrconfig that is new in Solr 4.3.1 that the apachesolr does not provide.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAriel",
