The  \nexception is this:  \n\nif (termEnum.term() == null) {  \n  throw new RuntimeException (\"no terms in field \" + field);  \n}  \n\nI'll attach a change suggested by Yonik Seeley that removes this exception. \n\nAlso, the if-condition above is incomplete anyway, so currently the exception \nis not always thrown (as termEnum .term() might well be != null but point to a \nterm in a different field already)",
