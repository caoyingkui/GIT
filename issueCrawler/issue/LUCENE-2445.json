    "description": "I started to work on LUCENE-2443, to create a test showing the\nproblems, but it turns out none of the core codecs (even sep/intblock)\never set a non-zero offset.\n\nSo I set forth to fix sep to do so, but ran into some issues w/ the\ncurrent bulk-read API that we should fix to make it higher\nperformance:\n\n\n\tFiltering of deleted docs should be the caller's job (saves an\n    extra pass through the docs)\n\n\n\n\n\tProbably docs should arrive as deltas and caller sums these up to\n    get the actual docID\n\n\n\n\n\tWhether to load freqs or not should be separately controllable\n\n\n\n\n\tWe may want to require that the int[] for docs and freqs are\n    \"aligned\", ie the offset into each is the same\n\n\n\n\n\tMaybe we should separate out a BulkDocsEnum from DocsEnum.  We can\n    make it optional for codecs (ie, we can emulate BulkDocsEnum from\n    the DocsEnum)",
