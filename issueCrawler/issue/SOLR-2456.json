    "description": "Querying by filters with values containing a + sign does not work as expected. Querying by the quoted value fails. Escaping the + and space without quotes also fails. I did finally get a query to work, but it involved both quoting the value and escaping the +, but not the space.\n\nEither quoting the value, or escaping should work.\n\nTo reproduce, create a test collection with two documents.\n  \"response\":{\"numFound\":2,\"start\":0,\"docs\":[\n{\n        \"listing_id\":2483808693,\n        \"required_experience\":[\"10+ Years\"]}\n,\n{\n        \"listing_id\":2484835296,\n        \"required_experience\":[\"1 to 2 Years\"]}\n]\n\nThese all return 0 results, I believe the first 4 should work.\n?fq=required_experience:1+to+2+Years\n?fq=required_experience:1%20to%202%20Years\n?fq=required_experience:10%2B%20Years\n?fq=required_experience:\"10+ Years\"\n?fq=required_experience:10+\\ Years\n\nThese do work, the second one should not work since %2B is quoted and should not then be urldecoded.\n?fq=required_experience:\"1 to 2 Years\"\n?fq=required_experience:\"10%2B Years\"\n\nI tested with the most recent build, apache-solr-4.0-2011-04-01_08-37-23.tgz\nschema.xml for required_experience is\n    <fieldType name=\"string\" class=\"solr.StrField\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" omitNorms=\"true\"/>\n   <field name=\"required_experience\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" />",

            "content": "There's a lot of different things going on here.  First, let's focus on lucene query syntax and forget about HTTP URL encoding (that's just transfer syntax stuff).\n\nA lucene query of\nrequired_experience:1 to 2 Years\nis really equivalent to\nrequired_experience:1 default_field:to default_field:2 default_field:Years\n\nNext, URL encoding is normally an implementation detail.  If Solr started supporting some other transport such as Thrift, there would be no %2b at all.  When the servlet container sees a %2b, it translates it into a \"+\" before Solr get's it.\n\nThere are certain query parsers (qparsers) specifically designed to help out at the lucene syntax level (so you don't have to deal with escaping special query parser chars, double quotes, etc.\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrQuerySyntax\n\nSince you're on 4.0-dev, I'd recommend using the \"term\" qparser for this:\n\nfq=\n{!term f=required_experience}\n10+ Years\n\nThe benefit is that at the lucene syntax level, there is no escaping whatsoever needed when appending the value you are filtering on.\n\nNow, for the HTTP layer, clients normally take care of the required escaping.  But if you're using something low-level like curl that does not do it for you, then it would look like:\n\nfq=\n{!term%20f=required_experience}\n10%2b%20Years "
