            "content": "In addition to fixing the FileFloatSource failure by allowing an  individual segment to use the cache based on the entire multireader, this patch lays the groundwork for caching per-segment reader.\n\nThe basic idea is that IndexReaders are wrapped by SolrIndexReaders each time a new IndexSearcher is opened - thus allowing any segment reader to know what multireader it is a part of... and the SolrIndexReader wrapper provides a better platform for caching than using weak references on IndexReaders.\n\nI'll commit shortly - comments welcome.
