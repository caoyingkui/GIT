This causes it to not be placed on the runtime classpath.\n\nThis change makes most Solr contrib modules' tests fail because of missing classes contained in the servlet-api jar.  For those modules with failing tests, I added a servlet-api test dependency.\n\nAll trunk Solr tests pass for me locally under Maven.\n\nCommitting shortly. "
