    "description": "Hi,\n\nI am encountering a NullPointerException when using \norg.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfo. It appears in version 3.1.0 and also in \nrevision 1099085 (May 3rd 2011).\n\nThe NullPointerException is thrown by SegmentInfo.sizeInBytes(false) when \ncalling SegmentInfo.sizeInBytes(false) and SegmentInfo.setHasVectors(true) in \nparallel. When these methods are called sequentially, they do not throw any \nexception.\n\nI have attached a test that exposes this problem. If you set ExposeBug = true,\nthe methods are called concurrently and you get the NullPointerException. If you\nset  ExposeBug = false, the methods are called sequentially, and there is no\nexception. Note that, in the sequential version, the methods are called many\ntimes (just like in the parallel version), and in different orders (just like\nin the parallel version).\n\nThe concurrent test (ExposeBug = true) always throws NullPointerException \nunder heavy load (ManyIterations = 100000000). Under small load (e.g., if you\nset ManyIterations = 10), the NullPointerException will not manifest. I suppose\nyou need a certain thread interleaving for the NullPointerException to happen,\nand thus you need the heavy load.\n\nIs this a bug? Is there a patch for it?\n\nThanks!\n\nAdrian",

Or something else...?\n\nNo, totally unrelated. I am testing a tool for testing concurrent code. I \nassumed that SegmentInfo is supposed to be thread safe and thus a good candidate \nfor testing.\n\nThanks again for your reply and very sorry the trouble!\n\nThanks!\n\nAdrian\n ",
