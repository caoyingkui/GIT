    "description": "SpatialPrefixTree makes \"Node\"s which are basically a rectangular spatial region that is more colloquially referred to as a \"Cell\".  It was named \"Cell\" in the first place and for whatever reason, Ryan and/or Chris renamed it as part of extracting it to a top level class from an inner class.  Most comments and variable names still use the \"cell\" terminology.  I'm working on an algorithm that keeps track of a tree of \"nodes\" and it has gotten confusing which kind of node I'm referring to, as each Node has one cell.\n\nIn maybe a week or so if there isn't discussion to the contrary, I'm going to commit a rename it back to \"Cell\".  And... while we're on this naming subject, perhaps \"SpatialPrefixTree\" could be named \"SpatialGrid\" ?  FWIW the variables referring to it are always \"grid\".",

            "content": "Wether it's QuadTree or whatever other tree, I don't think matters.  The reason why I think \"Cell\" is much better is that it evokes a conceptual understanding that people grok more easily in the context of spatial, I think, and it's thus colloquially also referred to as a \"cell\".  \"node\" is just too generic.  So using \"cell\" will hopefully be easier for people to understand as they use the API.  Hypothetically one might create a SpatialPrefixTree with a different number of dimensions than 2, and then \"cell\" is less convincing of an ideal name, but nonetheless I think that's okay. ",

It makes sense for basically the same reason as Node->Cell, but this class is more used and thus will more likely be breaking, and it also triggers other possible renames like the prefix and prefix.tree packages, and ...PrefixTree... classes.  Though it'd be nice to substitute the short 'n sweet \"Grid\" for the longer and compound word \"PrefixTree\".   ",
