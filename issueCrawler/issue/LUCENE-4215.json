If you specify the \"writerImpl\" parameter, it overrides the passed-in SolrWriter with your DIHWriter instance.  The current situation is a poor one and what you propose is definitely an improvement!  However, I think you can override SolrWriter with your own impl without code changes.  See SOLR-2943 for a full example. ",

With the current situation, one has to make a custom DataImport class and duplicate lots of its code (DIH is not meant to be subclassed, it seems...) or, i thought, make that small change and write:\n\nBar.java\nnew DataImporter() {\n  public void runCmd(RequestInfo reqParams, DIHWriter sw) {\n    DIHWriter w = new CustomWriter(null, ((SolrWriter) sw).req);\n    super.runCmd(reqParams, w);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe \"writerImpl\" parameter is definitely useful. Thanks for the link! ",
