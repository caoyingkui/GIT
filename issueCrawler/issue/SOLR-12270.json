ES does a neat trick and enables stricter production-grade checks only when it binds to an external network interface. For Solr the equivalent could perhaps be to enable such console warnings only if the\u00a0SOLR_HOST variable is explicitly configured\u00a0(i.e. not using default\u00a0localhost). We could even\u00a0refuse to start. ",

I've seen too many situations where users spend lots and lots and lots of time trying to track obscure errors resulting from having these limits too low. I want this message front-and-center. By the time they get annoyed enough to set the environment variable to turn the warning off it will stand a higher chance of being remembered.\n\nIMO of course... ",
