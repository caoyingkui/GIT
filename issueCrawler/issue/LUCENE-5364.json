    "description": "There are some hard-coded Version.LUCENE_XY constants used in various places.  Some of these are intentional and appropriate:\n\n\tin deprecated code, e.g. ArabicLetterTokenizer, deprecated in 3.1, uses Version.LUCENE_31\n\tto make behavior version-dependent (e.g. StandardTokenizer and other analysis components)\n\tto test different behavior at different points in history (e.g. TestStopFilter to test position increments)\n\n\n\nBut should hard-coded constants be used elsewhere?\n\nFor those that should remain, and need to be updated with each release, there should be an easy way to find them.",
