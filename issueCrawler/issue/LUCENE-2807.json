    "description": "Some small improvements would go a long ways...\n\nWhen trying to debug an intermittent fail, I usually run w/ -Dtests.verbose=true and w/ many iters.  But because the formatter buffers this can hit OOME, so maybe we make an unbuffered formatter.  Also, it'd be nice if we could have the formatter discard output for a given iter if there was no failure, and I think the iters should stop as soon as a failure is hit.\n\nMaybe somehow we make a new tests.mode that would switch on these behaviours?\n\nUnbuffered formatter is also vital when debugging a deadlock...",
