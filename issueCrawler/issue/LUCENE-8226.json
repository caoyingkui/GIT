Even most of the other random tests here are reasonable and use document counts of, e.g. 100.\n\nIn general, it seems like only one method is problematic. I don't understand the justification of a million documents for this test, are there sorting-specific bugs that it will really find as opposed to a smaller count?\n\n\n// pits index time sorting against query time sorting\npublic void testRandom3() throws Exception {\n  int numDocs;\n  if (TEST_NIGHTLY) {\n    numDocs = atLeast(100000);\n  } else {\n    numDocs = atLeast(1000);\n  }\n\n ",
