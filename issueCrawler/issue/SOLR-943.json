    "description": "It should be possible to specify dataDir directly for a core in solr.xml (over and above specifying it as a variable). It should also be possible to pass the dataDir as a request parameter while creating a core through the REST API.\n\nA simple scenario which requires this feature is when the location of the data directory depends on runtime parameters (such as free disk space or number of directories inside a directory).",

Currently there is no means to change any property while the core is up and running. It is only possible during core creation. We will have to make quite some changes to make this possible "
