    "description": "While looking into SOLR-8970 i realized there was a whole heap of problems with how clientAuth was being handled in tests.  Notably: it wasn't actaully being used when the randomization selects it (aparently due to a copy/paste mistake in SOLR-7166).  But there are few other misc issues (improper usage of sysprops overrides for tests, missuage of keystore/truststore in test clients, etc..)\n\nI'm working up a patch to fix all of this, and add some much needed tests to explicitly verify both SSL and clientAuth that will include some \"false positive\" verifications, and some \"test the test\" checks.",

            "content": "\nWorking on SOLR-9040 helped me discover some stuff about when/how exactly the JVM reads in the javax.net.ssl.* sys props to build the default SSLContext \u2013 notably: it's a singleton, so we can't change the sysprops after startup and expect it to do what is expected.  (And there doesn't appear to be ably convinience classes/methods for loading a \"custom\" SSLContext that obeys those properties by default unless/until you override them)\n\nIn this updated patch, I've added test code to preserve the SSLContext.getDefault() on test class init, and use SSLContext.setDefaul() during testing to mimic the effects of how the JVM should behave if the corisponding javax.net.ssl.* properties had been set. (then restore the preserved default in an @After method)\n\nThis seems to be working well.\n\nI briefly considered eliminating all of the explicit modifications of HttpCiientUtil's HttpClientBuilder / SchemaRegistryProvider in these tests, so we were always mimicing how a solrj code will behave by default when these props are set, but ultimately I think the current mix of both styles of getting an SSLContext are better \u2013 it helps us test both the \"solrj client expects to use standard javax sys properties\" approach, and the \"solrj client code explicitly using HttpCiientUtil to say 'use these options for ssl'\" approach.\n\nThere's still a handful of nocommits, that fall into two categories:\n\n\tI want to cleanup some of the SSLTestConfig methods that only exist in master and have weird side effects (introduced in SOLR-4509)\n\tI think it might makes sense to promote the the SSLContext.getDefault/setDefault preservation to SolrTestCaseJ4 ... but i'm not 100% certain yet.
