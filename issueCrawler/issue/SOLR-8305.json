Context is that elsewhere in the classes the IndexSchema member is used instead of the QParser method parameter and would the resulting schema not be the same when using the member instead of the parameter? Motivation here is potential removal of the QParser argument from the getValueSource signature.",

I've found it useful for doing interesting/custom things from the getValueSource method since it provides context to the outside world beyond simply fetching the valueSource.  However I believe the cases where I've used it, I could have used the SolrRequestInfo ThreadLocal/singleton. ",
