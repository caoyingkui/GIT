    "description": "There are some problems with it, particularly in the areas of still referencing <cores> in solr.xml and commingling stand-alone and SolrCloud.\n\n1> A number of the commands say things like \"The name of the new core. Same as \"name\" on the <core> element.\" CREATE, STATUS, UNLOAD at least. <core> hasn't been supported for a while.\n\n2> the CREATE command in particular is confusing about what instanceDir is all about and how it relates to dataDir. What should be in instanceDir? core.properties? config files (unless configset is specified)? etc.\n\n3> CREATE also lists SolrCloud options. Perhaps mark these as \"expert\"? I suspect putting these params in just plain like they are contributes to people trying to use the core admin API when they should be using the Collections API in SolrCloud mode.\n\nThis has been true for a while, so there's no need to hold up 6.4 docs for this.",
