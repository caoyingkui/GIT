    "description": "In 1.4 it was possible to have a field that was not to be indexed or stored. This was\nuseful in passing information that Lucene should ignore but that layers on top\nof it should pickup. This saves the need for an extra class to wrap a Lucene Document.\n\nSorry it has taken me two years to spot the change:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.java?rev=150206&r1=149967&r2=150206&diff_format=h\n\nI have to admit that this really isn't a Lucene bug but the 1.4 behaviour was really handy\nlike XML processing instructions.",
