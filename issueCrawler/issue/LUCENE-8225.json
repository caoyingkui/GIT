    "description": "The ant generate tasks currently always normalize line endings to the local conventions. This was required by Subversion. With GIT it depends on your local config, but we should really use unix endings by default (don't use autofix crlf on windows, as this breaks shell/cmd scripts).\n\nThe idea is:\n\n\tadd a property which defaults to \"UNIX\"\n\tfix the CRLF tasks in ant's build to use it\n\n\n\nIf somebody really wants to use Git's autofixing, he needs to change the property in his lucene.build.properties.",
