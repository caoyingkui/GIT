    "description": "Authorization checks in Solr are implemented by invoking configured authorization plugin with AuthorizationContext object. The plugin is expected to return an AuthorizationResponse object which provides the result (which can be OK/FORBIDDEN/PROMPT).\n\nIn some cases (e.g. document level security implemented in Apache Sentry), it is useful for the authorization plugin to add (or override) the request parameters sent by the user (which are represented as SolrParams in AuthorizationContext). This jira is to introduce an ability to customize the parameters by the authorization plugin.",
