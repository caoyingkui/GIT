For example, if we need to change the node name, we would like it to stay connected to the same shard, but it will choose a new one and we can't force it to stay in the old shard.",

Now if we want to change it to `hostname -i`, for example, to have Solr use IPs instead, when this node starts it is not guaranteed to be in the same shard as before. Since the node name is unknown the \"next\" shard is picked for this node.\n\nI would like to be able to specify the shard:\n\n-DnumShards=3 -Dhost=`hostname` -DshardId=2\n\n "
