    "description": "GraphML output for Solr graph traversals was introduced in version 6.1 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-8972).\n\u00a0\nHowever, the output is missing some required information as described by the GraphML specification, aka GraphML Primer (http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html).\n\u00a0\nSpecifically the attributes are missing the corresponding declarations using the <key> element, as described in http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html#Attributes.\n\u00a0\nSolr's output includes the GraphML-Attribute values, defined using the <data> elements inside nodes and links, but is missing the corresponding declaration of the attributes as <key> elements (including id, name and type) that should precede the graph definition.\n\u00a0\nThis is how it should look like:\n\u00a0\nhttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/310d6653ead928b844f39ad59862265c/raw/eb321c5d54d8231590516dae12b538af0ded626d/graphml_with_keys.graphml\n\u00a0\nAnd this is how it currently looks like (note the missing <key> elements):\n\u00a0\nhttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/310d6653ead928b844f39ad59862265c/raw/eb321c5d54d8231590516dae12b538af0ded626d/graphml_without_keys.graphml",
