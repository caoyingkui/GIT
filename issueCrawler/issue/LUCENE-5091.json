I'm consulting the other dev's on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-460?focusedCommentId=13712434&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13712434 on a suitable replacement, which will block me committing this for the moment.\n\nAlso, I updated the package.html summary with a new description matching the class javadocs:\n\n<li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNotQuery SpanNotQuery} removes spans\nmatching one {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanQuery SpanQuery} which overlap (or comes\nnear) another.  This can be used, e.g., to implement within-paragraph\nsearch.</li>\n\n ",
