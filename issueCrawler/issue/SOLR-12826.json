    "description": "We should have a policy to the effect of \"maxShardsPerHost=1\" by default.\n\nI created a 4 node cluster , created lots of collection on node1 and node2.\n\nThen used the suggestions to move replicas. I ended up with a scenario where both replicas of a collection was on one node.\n\nSo if we create a policy such that this can never happen as maxShardsPerHost=1 was the default\n\n{\"replica\": \"<2\", \"shard\" : \"#EACH\" , \"node\" :\"#ANY\", \"strict\" : \"false\" }",
