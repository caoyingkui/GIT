    "description": "the collection create AIP may create a collection that user not expected when the solr-nodes number less than the request collection's replicas number.EX. the cluster have 5 avalaible solr-nodes. than user want create a collection with API param \"numShards=2&numReplicas=2\". this will lead to a collection contained 2 shards but one own 2 replicas and another own 1 replica. More serious, this will lead a collection loss one shard while the API param is \"numShards=3&numReplicas=2\". this will confuse the user. this incomplete collection will confuse the user. so we should discard the  colletion create action while the numLivedNode < numShards * (numReplicas + 1)",
