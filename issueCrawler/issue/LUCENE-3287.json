    "description": "Spinoff from this thread:\n\nhttp://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/129668\n\nIn WeightedSpanTermExtractor the default maxDocCharsToAnalyze value is 0. This inhibits us from getting the weighted span terms in any custom code(e.g attached CustomHighlighter.java) that uses WeightedSpanTermExtractor. Currently the setMaxDocCharsToAnalyze() method is protected, which prevents us from setting  maxDocCharsToAnalyze to a value greater than 0. Changing the method to public would give us the ability to set the maxDocCharsToAnalyze.",
