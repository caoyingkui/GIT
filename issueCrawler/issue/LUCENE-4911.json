Though incorrect in French (cf http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/cel%C3%A0), it's common, but we may also add the correct spelling (e.g. \"cela\", whitout accent) to that stopwords list.\n\nAnother thing: I noticed that \"cel\u00e0\" is the only word of the list followed by an unbreakable space. Is that wanted?",
