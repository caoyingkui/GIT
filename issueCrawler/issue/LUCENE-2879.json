            "content": "+1 for fixing this inconsistent behavior.\nBTW also SpanWeight calls idfExplain() for same reason.\nPatch looks good, new test case passes with the fix and fails without it.\n\nA small thing that bothered me was that an explanation is created although the user did not call explain(), and in general explain() is considered slower, but it is called once per query, so it should not be a perf issue, and that's the case already for two other queries so anyhow this one (MFQ) should first be made consistent, which is done by this patch.\n\nIt is interesting that the implementation of a similar logic in SpanWeight is more compact:\nSpanWeight: calls extractTerms()\nterms=new HashSet<Term>();\nquery.extractTerms(terms);\nidfExp = similarity.idfExplain(terms, searcher);\n\n\n\nBut doing the same in MFQ would change its logic, as it would consider each term only once. \nNot saying that the patch should change, just pointing out the difference in sum-of-square-weights computation between SpanWeight and MFQ.\nBoolean Query fore example, would iterate over its sub queries and sum theirs, and so, if it so happens that the same term appears in two descendant queries that term would contribute twice to the sum. In this sense, MFQ and BQ behave similarly, both differ from SpanQuery... well I guess this falls to the \"black magic\" area  ",

But I suppose its ok, given that the whole thing is only an approximation anyway right?\n(In a lot of more \"ordinary\" short queries, the # of unique terms will be similar to # of terms).\n\nAdditionally if this really bothered someone, they could work around it by putting all the terms into a HashSet in their IDF implementation to make\nPhraseQuery, MultiPhraseQuery work like SpanQuery.\n\nIn general, when I look at the SpanQueries I am frustrated with other scoring problems.\nFor example, I think that SpanScorer by default should be consistent with our other Queries.\nBut imagine a Simple SpanTermQuery, its tf() calculation is done like this:\n\n   while (matches) {\n      int matchLength = spans.end() - spans.start();\n      freq += similarity.sloppyFreq(matchLength);\n   }\n   ...\n   similarity.tf(freq);\n\n\n\nIn my opinion this is an off-by-one \nIn the current implementation, this produces slop of 1 for an exact SpanTermQuery.\nif instead it were spans.end() - spans.start() - 1, it would produce a slop of 0,\nyielding a sloppyFreq of 1 for each match, and would equate exactly with TermQuery.
