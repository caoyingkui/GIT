    "description": "We have a program that uses Solrj to index data. For some (irrelevant) reason, the server sometimes returns \"413 FULL Head\" with no Content-Type header. When that happens, the Solrj library fails. \n\nIn HttpSolrClient.executeMethod, two things happen:\n\nIf there is no processor, then a RemoteSolrException is thrown, which is good. Ref https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_5_2_0/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/impl/HttpSolrClient.java#L493.\n\nHowever, when there is a processor, the code tries to call ContentType.parse() with the returned ContentType, which is null. This method throws a ParseException(\"Illegal content type\"), which propagates to the client. The cause of the error is very much hidden now. Ref https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_5_2_0/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/impl/HttpSolrClient.java#L513.\n\nIt would be nice if the client would throw a RemoteSolrException in this case, too.",
