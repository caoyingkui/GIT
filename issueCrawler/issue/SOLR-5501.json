    "description": "Following this conversation from the mailing list:\nhttp://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Proposal-for-new-feature-cold-replicas-brainstorming-td4097501.html\n\nShould give the ability to use replicas mainly as backup cores and not for handling high qps rate. \n\nThis way you would avoid using the caching ressources (solr and OS) used when routing a query to a replica. \nWith many replicas it's harder hitting the solr cache (same query may hit another replica) and having many replicas on the same instance would cause a useless competition on the OS memory for caching.",

They should be configurable in dependence to performance / cloud architecture, ie on replica basis.\n\nI want to set hot/cold roles to existing replicas, but we can also support this setting on ADDREPLICA call. Anyway I'd favor MODIFYCOLLECTION to support this. Do we want to explicitly configure all replicas as hot_replicas from now on, or will it be implicit unless they are configured as cold_replicas?\n\nIn case the hot/cold replica feature would integrate to SOLR-5132, it leaves to this Jira only a change in HttpShardHandlerFactory.makeURLList:239 that currently shuffles the replicas instead of favoring the hot replicas..
