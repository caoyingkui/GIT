This only causes issues for people that have forks or checkouts.\n\nWhat should we do with https://github.com/apache/solr/tree/trunk and https://github.com/apache/lucene/tree/trunk ?\n\nThose are the old pre-lusolr-merge SVN repos. So basically, Dawid does not need to clone them anyways, we can leave what exists there. It looks like it is complete. Although the trunk branch should be renamed to \"master\" (or github's config changed), because currently it shows the wrong ones if you go to repo's homepage (in case of solr it shows version 1.1, because this is the alphabetically first branch, for lucene its interestingly correct).

As I mentioned on LUCENE-6933, the git history contains two independent \"roots\" \u2013 one for Solr and one for Lucene, before they converge into one. Look at this graph:\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/dweiss/lucene-solr-svn2git-migration/master/docs/dev-lines-overview.png\n\nSo the visualization is (I think) showing Lucene up until merger with Solr, then catching up on Solr's development, and then continuing.

The video for that event looks pretty cool. Anyway, I def understand the history is complicated, even clean, given Lucene / Solr, the merge, but I guess I would expect the dates to look different. Okay, let's say first we play to 2005, up to when Solr is created in SVN, why does it then jump back to 2002? Solr should not have any history that old? "
