I don't think lucene should have heuristics here?\n\nInstead we could spend our time speeding up polygon support, improving testing, supporting multipolygon and polygon rings, etc, etc.\n\nIn https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-geojson/?include_text=1 it says:\n\nIn representing features that cross the antimeridian,\ninteroperability is improved by cutting geometries so that no single\npart crosses the antimeridian. \n...\nA rectangle extending from 40 degrees N, 170 degrees E across the\nantimeridian to 50 degrees N, 170 degrees W should be cut in two and\nrepresented as a MultiPolygon.\n\n "
