In index analyzers, a FlattenGraphFilterFactory is added as the last filter; and in fieldtypes with a dual purpose <analyzer>, the analyzer is split into index and query analyzers, and the FlattenGraphFilterFactory is added to the index analyzer.\n\nNot included here: switching ManagedSynonymFilterFactory to use SynonymGraphFilterFactory as its delegate.  I'll make a separate issue.\n\nRunning all Solr tests and precommit now. ",
