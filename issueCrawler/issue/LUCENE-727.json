            "content": "\nThank you Benson for the unit test and opening this issue!\n\nIndeed, when I run your test, I see the exception in Lucene-2.0.0, but, not on the trunk.\n\nIt looks like lockless commits (LUCENE-701 ) has fixed this because the files in the index are now \"write once\".  Specifically, we no longer try to rename any files (nor do we even use the \"deletable\" file anymore).  The general philosopy is to rely on as little from the filesystem as we possibly can, so as to maximize portability...\n\nThis is the exception on Lucene 2.0.0:\n\n    [junit] Testcase: testMmapIndex(org.apache.lucene.index.TestWindowsMMap):\tCaused an ERROR\n    [junit] Cannot delete F:\\mike\\src\\lucene-2.0.0\\testLuceneMmap\\deletable\n    [junit] java.io.IOException: Cannot delete F:\\mike\\src\\lucene-2.0.0\\testLuceneMmap\\deletable\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.renameFile(FSDirectory.java:268)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.writeDeleteableFiles(IndexWriter.java:827)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.deleteFiles(IndexWriter.java:778)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.mergeSegments(IndexWriter.java:747)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.mergeSegments(IndexWriter.java:686)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.maybeMergeSegments(IndexWriter.java:674)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.addDocument(IndexWriter.java:479)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.addDocument(IndexWriter.java:462)\n    [junit] \tat org.apache.lucene.index.TestWindowsMMap.testMmapIndex(TestWindowsMMap.java:61)\n\nSince this is fixed on trunk, I'll resolve it as fixed.\n\nBut first I'll commit the new unit test (thanks Benson)!
