The word \"clean\" does not at all imply that it will destroy your entire core, even if you are only trying to work on a single entity within that core, which is what is clearly suggested by selecting an entity from the combo box. In other words, this user interface is exactly the opposite of what it should be in an ideal situation: there is a poorly-labeled check box, for some reason always selected by default (after the user chooses it once apparently), that will delete all of your data.
