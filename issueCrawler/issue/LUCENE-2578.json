We use 1e-3 in other places when comparing scores.  Still, these are function queries, so... I don't yet understand why the scores were tweaked by using RIW.  Any ideas? ",

The test that was failing was a BQ with 3 SHOULD clauses.  The ScorerDocQueue, which holds the current sub-scorers \"ordered\" by their docIDs, does not break ties (it has no real reason to).  When you simply .nextDoc().score() the matching docs, these three subs' scores were summed in one order.  But then QueryUtil does a scorer.advance() to each doc, and that .advance() was then pulling the matching docs in a different order from the queue.  Summing the same 3 floats in different orders can easily result in a slightly different float due to different truncation.\n\nI'll commit shortly w/ the threshold increased from 1e-5 to 1e-3. ",
