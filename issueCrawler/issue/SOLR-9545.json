It logs the information about the missing pk attribute and in addition to that throws an exception with a proper message when that happens, so \"anonymous\" NPE is no longer thrown. \n\nLet me know, if you would like to have that handled differently  ",

In that case, the exception message is not correct. Also, could you make the exception a SolrException instead of a plain RuntimeException? and ideally add a unit test. ",
