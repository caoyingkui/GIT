    "description": "The problem we saw was that splitting a shard took a long time and at the end of it the sub-shards contained fewer documents than the original shard.\n\nThe root cause was eventually tracked down to the disappearing documents not falling into the hash ranges of the sub-shards.\n\nCould SolrIndexSplitter split report per-segment numDocs for parent and sub-shards, with at least a warning logged for any discrepancies (documents falling into none of the sub-shards or documents falling into several sub-shards)?\n\nAdditionally, could a case be made for erroring out when discrepancies are detected i.e. not proceeding with the shard split? Either to always error or to have an verifyNumDocs=false/true optional parameter for the SPLITSHARD action.",

It sounds like a bug in the hashing code either in the routing side or the splitting side. A document can never belong to multiple shard ranges because the partitioning code produces disjoint ranges.

The one with the majority of documents lost was tracked down to operational error (shardX files were copied to be shardY files), a second loss was of a few dozen documents only, for that never figured out if it was operational or something else. Other shard splits since then were fine i.e. no losses. "
