            "content": "it waits 30 seconds for the processor to do what it says it will do and \"expire\" the doc (ie: delete it)\n\nthe reason we wait 30 seconds (instead of something smaller) is because we need to give enough time for the doc to be added and be able to verify the doc is there \u2013 if we tighten up the time to something smaller, we could easily get false failures where the doc is added, then expired/deleted before we ever verify the initial add. (and if we don't verify the document is added properly, we'd get false positives thinking hte doc was deleted when it actually had a problem being added in the first place)\n\ni'm open to suggestions for improvements \u2013 but at the end of the day, what we're testing is that: 1) a Timer is created; b) that the timer fires; c) that a certain action happens.  we can make the timer duration as short as you want, but the current \"slowness\" exists because w/shorter durations it's trivial to get false successes and false failures.

I strive to keep anything in core tests to a minute or under, though occasionally we have outliers. If a test truly requires more than that, I think it should be run nightly in most cases. "
