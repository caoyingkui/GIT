    "description": "I open this issue, because I don't know the status. Since my commit on LUCENE-4415, the ANT build script no longer depend on Rhino/Javascript. I know that Solr tests itsself also depend on Javascript available (at least to test if it works with any scripting engine). I just want to make sure, we have correct assume's in all tests before I remove the additional JARs on Jenkins.\n\nI just want to note that there were maven issues with Rhino missing, too, so Steven, what is the status?\n\nThis issue is also to discuss about less Solr tests coverage without JS.",
