    "description": "The SolrMetricManager.overridableRegistryName() method is a great idea but unfortunately in practice I've found it doesn't really work; it seems fundamentally flawed.  I wish it could work.  The main issue I think is that the callers of SMM.registerGauge/registerMetric assumes it can place a gauge/metric and have it be the only once there (force==true).  But it won't be if it's shared.  \n\nAnother problem is in at least one of the reporters \u2013 JmxMetricsReporter.JmxListener#registerMBean will get in a race condition to remove an already-registered MBean but in the process of removing it, it'll already get removed concurrently by some other core working on the same name.  This results in javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException logged as a warning; nothing serious.  But I suspect conceptually there is a problem since which MBean should \"win\"?  Shrug.",

As it is now the feature is broken and leads to incorrect and misleading results, so I think it's ok to remove it.\n\nAlthough there's no 1:1 replacement for this feature, the aggregation of metrics across registries can be now achieved in a more consistent way using SolrShardReporter, SolrClusterReporter and /admin/metrics/collector.
