    "description": "Note that this is a nonsense value to pass in, since our PQ impl allocates the array up front.\n\nIt's because PQ takes 1+ this value (which wraps to -1), and attempts to allocate that.  We should bounds check it, and drop PQ size by one in this case.\n\nBetter, maybe: in IndexSearcher, if that n is ever > maxDoc(), set it to maxDoc().\n\nThis trips users up fairly often because they assume our PQ doesn't statically pre-allocate (a reasonable assumption...).",
