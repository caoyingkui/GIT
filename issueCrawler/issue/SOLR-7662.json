            "content": "As I'm doing this refactoring I notice a few discrepancies in the way the javabin and Text response writers\n\n\tjavabin returns the primitive types of the fields while the text based writers return a IndexableField/StorableFIeld depends on whether you are in branch 5x or trunk\n\tjavabin returns only the requested fields while text response writers get all the fields\n\n\n\nThis was fine till transformers were introduced. Transformers have to be conscious of these differences and should be coded accordingly . We need to standardize these .\n ",
