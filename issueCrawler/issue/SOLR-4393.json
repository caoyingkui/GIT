Select a core from the dashboard.\n2. Select 'Query'\n3. Without changing anything, click 'Execture Query'.\nExpected: 10 hits (or less depending on data indexed) displayed on the screen.\nObserved: See response below.\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/solr/coreName/select?\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<response>\n<lst name=\"responseHeader\"><int name=\"status\">0</int><int name=\"QTime\">0</int><lst name=\"params\"/></lst><result name=\"response\" numFound=\"0\" start=\"0\"></result>\n</response>\n\nIssue:  \"http://localhost:8080/solr/coreName/select?\" is incomplete and \"q=:\" is not appended to the url.\n\nTested on Firefox and Chrome and both suffer from this issue.",
