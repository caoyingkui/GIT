It seems somehow to be an alias for /v2/c. That should probably be fixed to instead be some top-level help for the API? ",

            "content": "Hi,\nI asked about this on the mailing list, because it was a typical \"first user experience\". The release notes stated that the new API is available on /v2 and that it is \"self-decribing\". So the first thing you try is to go to the root path with your REST client (in simplest case a browser). So it is a bad user experience, and IMHO it should be fixed in 6.6 (and possibly in the 6.5 series, too).\n\nIn addition, such error messages should come out as JSON, not in HTML. IMHO, below /v2, the Jetty error handler should be customized to retun a machine readable error message. I know that ES is only returning JSON! ",
