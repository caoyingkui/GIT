    "description": "Moving over here from SOLR-11892. After getting through my confusion I've found the following: NRTCachingDirectory.createOutput tries to delete segment files before creating them. We should at least add a bit of commentary as to what the pre-emptive delete is there for since on the surface it's not obvious.\n\ntry {\n  in.deleteFile(name);\n{{ } catch (IOException ioe) {}}\n  // This is fine: file may not exist\n{{ }}}\n\nIf I change to using MMapDirectory or NIOFSDirectory these exceptions are not thrown. What's special about NRTCachingDirectory that it needs this when two of the possible underlying FS implementations apparently do not? Or is this necessary for, say, Windows or file systems than the two I tried? Or is it some interaction between the RAM based segments and segments on disk?",

So over last night\u00a0I ran a test that randomly killed one of 4 jvms while indexing on the theory that if the preemptive deletes were cleaning up after some kind of anomaly it might trigger and it was fine.\n\nI'll look this over to get a better understanding of the code, but are people OK with this approach?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 ",
