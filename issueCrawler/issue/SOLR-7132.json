However, there's still a \"back door\" here since one can specify \"property.name\" in an ADDREPLICA command. Do you think is \"the right thing\" here would be to also dis-allow specifying \"property.name\" too? ",

            "content": "Hi Erick,\n\nYes we could also disallow \"property.name\" but this is my thinking currently. We have deprecated the name method for Solr 5.3 in SOLR-7499. We can remove it in Solr 5.4 . We don't make any changes to disallow \"property.name\" so that expert users who really have a use case of specifying the core name can use this method? \n\nWe can still fix the bug that it only changes the name on a restart and not while creation.  What do you think? ",

Making the option obvious does more harm than good IMO since it encourages people to shoot themselves in the foot. But deprecating it as you have done and allowing this \"back door\" keeps casual/new users from doing something bad because they see the \"name\" option but still allows someone who really cares to control naming. Not that I'd advise they do so, but you know someone will want to  ",
