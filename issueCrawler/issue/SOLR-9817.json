IMHO, directory locations are the kind of thing that we (on the development side) must be able to rely on to NOT change.  Support becomes extremely difficult if we cannot be sure of the relative location of pretty much everything other than the solr home or the core root directory. ",

Given we don't have anything setup to test these scripts really (we really should get Jenkins jobs), it's especially important we are very clear to other devs what we are trying to support and how and why it works as part of the script / code if we want to see the feature get properly supported and not disappear or break easily.
