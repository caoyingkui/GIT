Even though I only have 312k docs, UnInvertedField hit a limit \u2013 \"Too many values for UnInvertedField faceting on field text\".  I guess some of these docs are bigger than I thought and have lots of distinct terms; I dunno.  \n\nI'd like to add a new parameter named something like facet.uif.cache.minDf  (named similarly to the existing facet.enum.cache.minDf).",
