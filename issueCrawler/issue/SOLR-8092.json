    "description": "Currently the facet DocSet generated during the first phase of the distributed search is not cached. This means that during the facet refinement phase the DocSet needs to be recreated. This involves re-issuing the entire query and re-building the DocSet. In some use cases that can be a high price to pay to calculate refinements.\n\nThis ticket aims to find a way to cache the DocSet generated from the first phase so it can be re-used in the second phase.\n\nWe may also want to add a way to turn off refinements as some use cases might want to trade off performance for accuracy.",
