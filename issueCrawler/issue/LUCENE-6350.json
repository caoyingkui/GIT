Also, can you mark\nPrefixCodedTerms @internal (NOT @experimental) before making it public?\nThis is not intended to be a publicly consumable API.\n\nYou don't need to do the field.equals(lastField) on each term?  The\niterator tells you when it switches to a new field.\n\nYou added an \"if (disi == null)\" check, which is great; do we have a\ntest that tickles that?\n\nIs RAMFile.equals/hashCode or PrefixCodedTerms.equals/hashCode ever\nused anywhere else in the code base (because now they are quite\ncostly)?  I assume not... "
