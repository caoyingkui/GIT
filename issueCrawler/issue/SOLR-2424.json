When I tried the 0.8 version the same problem occurs as is described in this ticket, so it appears that the bug is in Tika and that it is already resolved in the 0.9 release.\n\nI'll try to update the version of Tika in use in my installation, although it's something that has caused more problems than it has solved when I've tried it in the past.
