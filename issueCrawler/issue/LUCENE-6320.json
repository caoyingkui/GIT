            "content": "Here is a patch. We use codec apis to do these checks, so the optimizations we already worked on for merge help a lot (esp. stored fields, norms, docvalues).\n\nWhen we check postings without deletes, we weren't reusing postingsenum and were clone()'ing for every term.\n\nFieldInfos.get(int) is a cpu hog for stored fields and vectors, since its called for every field in the doc and we do O(log N) lookup each time. Its wasteful in memory usually too (using a treemap always when in most cases a simple array is smaller and faster). "

This was like a 10-15% improvement, but the other changes here to CI are more important. "
