    "description": "When a search term is expanded into a set of alternatives (using Fuzzy, Range, Prefix or Wildcard queries), the user really wants documents that have any one of the alternatives (ideally the exact one typed). She is not asking for the document that contains the maximum number of different alternatives, but that is how the scoring works.\n\nThe problem is that the SHOULD directive doesn't implement an OR between alternatives but an AND/OR.\n\nfrederick~ alderwood~ expands to something like:\n(frederick frederich^0.9 fredereck^0.9) (alderwood elderwood^0.9 underwood^0.8)\n\nA document containing frederick, frederich and fredereck would score more highly than one with the exact search terms, frederick and alderwood, yet it only satisfies one of the user's two query terms.\n\nThe problem is not the same as issue 329 but is caused by the scores for all of the expanded terms being summed. What is required is the maximum score for any of the alternatives for each term, summed across all terms.",
