    "description": "The shards() streaming expression is a stream source that emits a set of shards to be searched. All the Solr stream sources will accept this expression and use it instead of collection name to contact the shards if it's passed in.\n\nA base ShardsStream implementation that simply takes a list of shards as will be mapped to the shards() expression.\n\nUsers can override the shards expression with custom functionality by extending the ShardsStream and mapping the custom implementation in the solrconfig.\n\nThis is a generic solution for people who don't use SolrCloud but want to use Streaming and Parallel SQL and JDBC.",
