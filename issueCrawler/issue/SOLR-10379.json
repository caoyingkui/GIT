While I was at it, I installed and used the IntelliJ plugin named \"Wrap To Column\" to wrap at 120 chars (a.k.a. \"fill paragraph\") in the two .adoc files I edited.  (IntelliJ's \"Fill Paragraph\" edit item was inactive for me in .adoc files, and the \"Wrap To Column\" plugin author says that he wrote it because he couldn't get \"Fill Paragraph\" to work: https://andrewbrookins.com/tech/wrap-comments-and-text-to-column-width-in-intellij-editors/).  \n\nCassandra Targett could you take a look and see if there's a problem with this?  (AFAICT, using the JavaFX renderer in IntelliJ, wrapping long lines didn't change the HTML formatting.)\n\nI think it's ready to go. ",

There is project consensus to wrap code at 120-chars; why make an exception for these doc files?\n\nBut, isn't it inconsistent to only do it on the one page you've edited?\n\nYes, but it would be time-consuming to do in all pages, so I thought maybe a fix-as-we-go strategy was more prudent?\n\nDid you add the break (\\) in the middle of the curl examples (such as L#239) or did your IDE do that?\n\nI did that.
