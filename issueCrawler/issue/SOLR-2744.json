    "description": "Because the methods of ModifiableSolrParams that return \"this\" are declared to return ModifiableSolrParams, as soon as the code calls one of those methods on an object that is in fact a SolrQuery, it cannot chain any more SolrQuery-specific methods.\n\nJava allows covariant return types, so a simple solution is to redefine those methods in SolrQuery to return SolrQuery.  For example:\n\n\npublic SolrQuery add( String name, String ... val ) {\n    super.add(name, val);\n    return this;\n}",
