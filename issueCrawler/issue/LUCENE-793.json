This can occur for nearly all methods from low level problems like wrong permissions, transient IO errors, bad hard drive or corrupted file system, corrupted index, etc, but for some methods there are also more interesting causes that we should try to document.\n\nSpinoff of this thread:\n\n    http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/44929",

Yes this a new exception created by this patch.\n\nThere are quite a few places (8 actually) where we previously threw an\nIOException and I've now changed to a CorruptIndexException.  Also\nsince IOException is checked, there are presumably many catch clauses\nout there that would at least catch (yet probably not handle) these\ncorruption cases now.\n\nAll of these cases, plus the IllegalStateException cases, should be\nexceptionally rare, but I think it's \"more\" backwards compatible to\nleave the base class of the new CorruptIndexException as IOException?
