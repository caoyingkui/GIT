    "description": "Right now, PULL replicas can only replicate from the leader. This is good because it gives the PULL replicas the latest index available, but it can also cause a bottleneck in the leader. We should allow users to configure the PULL replicas to replicate from other replicas (other TLOG replicas for example, or maybe even other PULL replicas too)\n\nThis should be configurable (and probably not the default)",
