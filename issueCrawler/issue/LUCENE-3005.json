But even in this case, new checks can be added to the script once they have been identified.\n\nSo IMHO this should be closed as won't fix.  I'll do so tomorrow if there are no objections.\n ",

            "content": "Right, i think a lot of this is old news, its not perfect but we are closer.\n\nAs far as what Grant mentioned in the original thread: I think we've tried to automate this as much\nas possible in the smokeTestRelease.py: it takes the actual generated artifacts and does a ton\nof tests on them.\n\nAs i mentioned in the original thread, the worst part of the release process before was that the code\nwasn't releasable until someone cleaned it up: I think this is significantly better. We have a lot\nmore checks in the build system: nitpicking over javadocs, 3rd party dependencies, license headers,\netc, etc. And we run the smokeTestRelease.py as a weekly hudson job to ensure things like packaging\nare not broken.\n\nIn my opinion we should continue down this path, trying to ensure that our code is always releasable\nat any time from this kind of perspective, rather than adding manual steps.\n\nI think the right way to do this is just like how we handle bugs in our code. If a problem crops up\nin e.g. packaging, don't just fix it, but also add a 'test' (code to smokeTestRelease or whatever) so\nthat jenkins is continuously looking for it.\n\nIn my opinion most of the previous problems were all due to:\n\n\tnot having tests (in this sense 'test' means testing packaging, licensing, etc)\n\tnot having automated builds running those tests.\n\n ",
