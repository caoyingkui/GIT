    "description": "When the managed-schema was made the default, we made mostly only minor changes to the Ref Guide to make sure managed-schema was mentioned in the same places schema.xml had been mentioned so users didn't get the impression they were different files or perhaps had a different structure. At that time, Hoss had this to say about it:\n\n\nThere are still a TON of references to schema.xml that i did not touch however, because they are on pages side by side with explicit & specific examples of schema.xml XML declarations (ie: how to define a field, or field type) ... we need to holistically decide what we want to do with this\n\nWhat we should do now is revamp the schema coverage throughout the Ref Guide. Where appropriate we should add examples of using the Schema API in addition to (or instead of) only discussing manual edits. Additionally, we should consolidate the pages on Managed Schema, Schemaless mode, schema editing, the structure of the file, etc. This info is a bit scattered for something that is central to a successful implementation of Solr.",
