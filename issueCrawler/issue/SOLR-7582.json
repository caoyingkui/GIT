    "description": "I think the SolrCloud example (bin/solr e cloud) should enable soft auto-commits by default. The script should enable soft-commits using the Config API, which will give a good example of using the Config API for new users.\n\nAlso, the data_driven configs should allow setting the auto-commit values using -D sys props as in the techproducts solrconfig.xml.\n\nI'd like to get this into 5.2 as I've run into several people that send data into their collection only and don't see any docs (because soft-commits are disabled). So this is a usability issue for new users.",
