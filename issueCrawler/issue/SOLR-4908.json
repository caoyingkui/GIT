    "description": "The SolrContentHandler produces glued words when extracting html\n\nfor html documents like:\n\n<html><head></head><body>glued<br/>words</body></html>\n\n\n\nThis was solved in Tika TIKA-343 but the problem occurs when using the extraction handler because the SolrContentHandler discards ignoreableWhitespace.\nThe Tika XHTMLContentHandler issues ignoreableWhitspace events with a newline in the character stream when a <br> tag is encountered.\n\nThe SolrContentHandler should be modified to add the ignorable whitespace to the content.\n\nReproduction Steps:\n\n\tPOST the html example file from the attachtments to http://localhost:8983/solr/update/extract?literal.id=html-test-1&commit=true (e.g. with curl or HTTP Requester Plugin in Firefox)\n\tQuery for the document http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=id%3A%22html-test-1%22&fl=content&wt=xml&indent=true\n\tLook for the field content, which contains the word \"Shouldnotbeglued\"",
