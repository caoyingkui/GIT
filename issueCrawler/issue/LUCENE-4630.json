    "description": "there are times when people want to add assumptions in test to prevent confusing/false failures in certain situations (eg: known bugs in JVM X, known incompatibilities between lucene feature Z and filesystem Y, etc...)\n\nBy default we want these situations to be \"skiped\" in tests with clear messages so that it's clear to end users trying out releases that these tests can't be run for specific sitautions.\n\nBut at the same time we need a way for developers to be able to try running these tests anyway so we know if/when the underliyng problem is resolved.\n\ni propose we add a \"tests.suspicious.shit\" system property, which defaults to \"false\" in the javacode, but can be set at runtime to \"true\"\n\nassumptions about things like incompatibilities with OSs, JVM vendors, JVM versions, filesystems, etc.. can all be dependent on this system propery.",

Please note: Policeman Jenkins (before it was shot by some Generics Drug Dealer) was running JRockit with this JVM option. ",

Anyplace we might normally write...\n\n\nboolean someBoolean = ...something interesting...;\nif (someBoolean) {\n  throw new AssumptionViolatedException(\"...why your system is suspicious...\")\n}\n\n\n\n...could be replaced with...\n\n\nboolean someBoolean = ...something interesting...;\nif (someBoolean || Boolean.getBoolean(\"tests.suspicious.shit\")) {\n  throw new AssumptionViolatedException(\"...why your system is suspicious...\")\n}\n\n\n\n...of the top of my head, i wasn't sure if an annotation would be as easy to use (particularly when you might mix and match with other test groups)\n\n@SuspiciousJ9Shit\n\nMy suggestion was to try and keep it reaallly generic ... so that with one \"option\" active you say \"i'm a developer who is asking for trouble, try everything even if you think it's not valid on my system.  Making people know that their particular os/jvm/filesystem/jvm-opt-combos are suspicious therefore they need to explicitly ask for test group X and test group Y test group Z seems like it would make it overly hard for people to try everything.\n\nPerhaps the ideal case would be specific annotations like you describe, which could be used as test groups for people who want to go out of their way to test specific suspicious stuff (ie: \"there is a new J9 JVM, does it still have these problems?\") but then have a feature in the runner that by default those groups are skipped with a clear AssumptionViolatedException(\"...what is suspicious about your setup ...\") but if you set \"-Dtest.suspicious.shit=true\" then instead the runner will run those tests anyway, but wrap any failures/exceptions it gets in another \"FailureUnderSuspiciousCircumstances\" exception whose getMessage() would contain info about what assumption would have normally prevented that test from if you hadn't gone out of your way to run it.\n\nwhat do you think?\n ",

I get your idea but I don't know how to implement it in a sensible way. It could be a rule that would intercept failures, check for groups annotations and then rethrow... but I honestly don't think many people would find it useful (or understand the principle under which it operates).\n\nDawid ",
