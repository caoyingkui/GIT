It's only the non static \"iterative\" use methods \u2013 which are not used anywhere in the solr code \u2013 that are lacking decent test coverage.\n\nSeveral months ago, i worked up a patch to deprecate & remove the unused methods, but aparently i never uploaded/commited that patch, and can't find it on my computer.\n\nOver in SOLR-4329, Smiley is currently working to revamp the logic of how DocumentBuilder works to better support complex FieldTypes, so it doesnt' seem prudent to try and recreate my previous work at the moment \u2013 let's see how things shape up there.  (Even if we decide not to more forward with that proposal, I just noticed there is also SOLR-4167 to explicitly track cleaning up those unused methods)\n\n "
