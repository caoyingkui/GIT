            "content": "wait ... what?\n\nFWIW: I'm -0 on the installer making solr.in.sh writable by any user other then the user running the installer (ie: \"root\").\n\nIn general this seems like a really risky step that could make potential security holes in the future 10x worse then they would be otherwise.  Example: imagine a hypothetical future security hole where a solr request handler allows writting to files on disk.  if the filesystem permissions of solr.in.sh mean it's writable by the solr user running the webapp, now an attacker can influence the way the solr webapp is run on restart, opening up more holes.\n\nif the motivation here is to allow bin/solr ... subcommands to easily muck with solr.in.sh then the solution to that objective should be error checking and help messages instructing the user that those specific commands need to be run as root via {{sudo bin/solr ... }}\n\nIn general, the places a service's effective UID should be able to write to should be VERY limited, and constrained tothe well known place where that service keeps it's \"data\" ... enabling apps with the ability to overwrite their configuration is a big red flag.

But then it turns out that kerberos mode needs them...\n\nI know there are other efforts under way to secure other passwords better, so perhaps we'll at some point get rid of pws both in solr.in and in cmdline.\n\nAn option someone proposed was to pass passwords through shell env variables but not as Java Option. That way it is not visible in ps, but Solr could still read the variable with System.getenv()... In that case it could make sense to have password in a o-rwx solr.in.sh file? ",
