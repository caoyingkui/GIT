    "description": "The split shard command doesn't split a shard correctly when the index has parent-child documents.\n\nThe way split shard works is it goes through all documents id's in that shard and then decides which sub-shard would it belong in . It is not aware of the parent child relationship during this process\n\nSo the parent-child documents could be orphaned and end up in different shard\nSecondly, even with the routing of parent and child documents were the same split shards needs to re-index them as a block",

It should be enough to just use the hash of _root_ for all of the children and they should still end up contiguous in the newly created split indexes. ",
