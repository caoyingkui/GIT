    "description": "I hit this in working on LUCENE-1044.\n\nIf you disk full event during flush, then DocumentsWriter will abort\n(clear all buffered docs).  Then, if you then add another doc or two,\nand then close your writer, and this time succeed in flushing (say\nbecause it's only a couple buffered docs so the resulting segment is\nsmaller), you can flush a corrupt segment (that incorrectly has a\nnon-zero docStoreOffset).\n\nI modified the TestConcurrentMergeScheduler test to show this bug.\nI'll attach a patch shortly.",

I created more unit tests in\nTestIndexWriter to test hitting a single IOException, at different\npoints, and then NOT hitting anymore exceptions, and verifying we can\nclose & open a reader successfully.\n\nThe fix itself is trivial and low risk.\n\nI think this is serious enough to re-spin 2.3.  \n\nI will commit shortly to trunk & port to 2.3 branch.
