But that doesn't mean it's a useless parameter and should be removed.  One of the first things I do when trying to debug a Chaos* fail is to set that parameter to false and see if the error happens with adds only.  It simplifies debugging. "

In that case, it does feel like a trivial cleanup (prob no one else ever used it) and wouldn't even warrant a JIRA IMO.\n "
