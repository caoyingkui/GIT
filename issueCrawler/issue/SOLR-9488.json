            "content": "I was wondering why SolrCloud is not affected by this bug. This is because on shutdown, the DirectUpdateHandler2 commits explicitly and writes the commit data instead of relying on IndexWriter.close. The reason why this did not happen for shard split is because DUH2 commits on close only if the update log has uncommitted changes and is active. Both of those conditions are false when we split shards and merge the index directly into a core. ",
