    "description": "It seems that in 1.4rc2, a call to IndexWriter.addIndexes (IndexReader[]) will\nclose the provided IndexReader; in 1.3-final this does not happen.  So my code\nwhich uses addIndexes to merge new information into an index and then calls\nclose() on the IndexReader now crashes with an \"already closed\" exception.  I\ncan attach test code which works in 1.3 but not in 1.4rc2 if that would be helpful.\n\nIf this is an intentional change in behavior, it needs to be documented.  Thanks!",
