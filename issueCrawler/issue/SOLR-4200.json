    "description": "The following line in CachingDirectoryFactory is resulting in a lot of noise in my branch_4x logs.  It was added by Yonik's recent major sync from trunk to branch_4x, r1420992.\n\nlog.info(\"Releasing directory:\" + cacheValue.path);\n\nThis was probably added to debug a problem, but it seems to get called a lot.  The specific thing that led me to bring it up is that it is logged four times for every call to /admin/mbeans.  When you've got seven cores and you hit them all, it increases the logging from 7 lines to 35.  IMHO, it should be moved to debug instead of info.\n\nINFO  - 2012-12-15 13:36:01.674; org.apache.solr.core.CachingDirectoryFactory; Releasing directory:/index/solr4/cores/s0_0/../../data/s0_0\nINFO  - 2012-12-15 13:36:01.676; org.apache.solr.core.CachingDirectoryFactory; Releasing directory:/index/solr4/cores/s0_0/../../data/s0_0/index\nINFO  - 2012-12-15 13:36:01.676; org.apache.solr.core.CachingDirectoryFactory; Releasing directory:/index/solr4/cores/s0_0/../../data/s0_0\nINFO  - 2012-12-15 13:36:01.678; org.apache.solr.core.CachingDirectoryFactory; Releasing directory:/index/solr4/cores/s0_0/../../data/s0_0/index\nINFO  - 2012-12-15 13:36:01.679; org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore; [s0build] webapp=/solr path=/admin/mbeans params=\n{qt.path=/admin/mbeans&wt=javabin&stats=true&version=2}\n status=0 QTime=6",
