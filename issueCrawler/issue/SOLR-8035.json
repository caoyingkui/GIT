There are many JS tools out there that do the equivalent of Ivy dependency management, and others that minify CSS/JS/HTML and then merge those files into a smaller number of files, such that the overall HTTP payload of the UI could be substantially reduced. For local loads this has never been an issue, but I have been to visit hosted Solr servers where the UI fails to load due to poor network connectivity.\n\nIdeally, \"ant run\" would run the UI in place, whereas \"ant server\" would execute a build process and produce minfied files/etc. ",
