            "content": "Hi Ashok. I understand that you had issues with a production Solr version 4.3.1 and that you want to find the reason and get it fixed. However, this JIRA is not the right place for getting help with debugging issues in a production system; only for reporting actual or likely bugs in the Solr source code.\n\nSo I'm kindly going to close this issue as \"Invalid\" and ask you to direct your questions to the solr-user@lucene.apache.org mailing list instead. There you will receive community help debugging your setup. You will likely be asked for a lot more information about your setup than you provided here, so be prepared to answer questions about your configuration, number of nodes, more logs etc.\n\nIf you end up finding a real bug, chances are that it is already fixed in a later released version of Solr and the remedy would then be to upgrade. It may make sense to anyway plan an upgrade to the latest (and most stable) 4.x release, namely 4.10.4.\n\nImportant: If this issue is causing down-time and is critical for you, you are probably better off contacting a Lucene/Solr expert directly for immediate help, see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Support ",
