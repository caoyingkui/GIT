    "description": "A stopword filter factory could be (re)configurable via REST API by registering with the RESTManager described in SOLR-5653, and then responding to REST API calls to modify its init params and its stopwords resource file.\n\nRead-only (GET) REST API calls should also be provided, both for init params and the stopwords resource file.\n\nIt should be possible to add/remove one or more entries in the stopwords resource file.\n\nWe should probably use JSON for the REST request body, as is done in the Schema REST API methods.",

I'll commit to trunk shortly. "
