    "description": "I'm attempting to create a new Solr Core using an existing set of config files. Specifically these are being taken from the Drupal module search_api_solr-7.x-1.9 in this tarball: http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/search_api_solr-7.x-1.9.tar.gz\n\nThe config dir located in the tarball is: search_api_solr/solr-conf/5.x/\n\nThis works fine, as I was able to copy this config directory in the shell then use the Solr Admin UI to create the core. No errors were reported in that methodology.\n\nHowever, I'm reading the help documentation included by executing the command `bin/solr create_core -help` which states:\n\n\"-d <confdir>  Configuration directory to copy when creating the new core, built-in options are:\n      basic_configs: Minimal Solr configuration\n      data_driven_schema_configs: Managed schema with field-guessing support enabled\n      sample_techproducts_configs: Example configuration with many optional features enabled to demonstrate the full power of Solr\n\n      If not specified, default is: data_driven_schema_configs\n\n      Alternatively, you can pass the path to your own configuration directory instead of using one of the built-in configurations, such as: bin/solr create_core -c mycore -d /tmp/myconfig\"\n\nSo I tried the following command:\n\nbin/solr create_core -c testcore -d /opt/drupal/search_api_solr-7.x-1.9/solr-conf/5.x\n\nThis resulted in:\n\nERROR: Error CREATEing SolrCore 'testcore': Unable to create core [testcore] Caused by: /var/solr5/data/testcore/data\n\nI was instructed on IRC that I am using the command incorrectly and that valid options for '-d' are only \"basic_configs\", \"data_driven_schema_configs\",  or \"sample_techproducts_configs\"\n\nI am unable to create a core from the command line, and I don't know what the process should look like.",
