I work in the federal government - we are urged not to have our applications in the line of authentication at all, but to use redirect federated authentication scenarios such as CAS, Oauth2, OpenID, etc. but usually not with all OpenID providers \n\nSo, teaching Solr scripts such as bin/solr with the ability to interact with all such authentication plugins could not easily happen, unless the redirection somehow identifies itself as a security challenge.   I'll look into that and report back. ",

There is an HC BasicAuthenticationHttpClientConfigurer, but it requires a username and password in the constructor, and SolrCLI doesn't seem to provide one, so I'm not sure how it can work. ",

SolrCLI usually does not create requests but rather  goes directly through the JSON API using routines such as getJson() and postJsonToSolr().    As I thought before, the right place to add basic auth seems to be in getHttpClient().\n\nHowever, I do also see some places where for cloud tools, a CloudSolrClient is created.   There, something else is needed.\n\nFinally, I had somehow expected that getCommonToolOptions() would do just that, and I would be able there to add options.   I see now that would be a mistake - the ExampleTool does not need an authentication option, because it will not be creating a cloud that uses security.json.\n\nFor now, I will make a start by making sure that CreateTool() works properly, with a manually added Option for that tool.   I will therefore also be handling CreateCollectionTool().   Once that works, I'll have to slowly work forward to other tools, and I will need help to know that I've got all of them that need this option.\n\nHow the username and password are passed in is less important to me right now - I can iterate on that once I have a basic mechanism.

One hesitation I have is that others may use it for different things - this is something I rely on committers to either know or check on... it is certainly safer to use something in a test case than in SolrCLI.
