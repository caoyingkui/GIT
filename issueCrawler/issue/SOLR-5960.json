One public API that could be used and introduces no external dependencies: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/DatatypeConverter.html\n\tYou are getting the bytes of the string without specifying a charset, so it depends on default encoding. Please specify StandardCharsets.US_ASCII here (because basic auth credentials must be encoded using that charset).\n\n "
