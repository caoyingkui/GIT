    "description": "just by the nature of using Apache httpd our website is pretty well behaved in terms of Last-Modified & ETag headers \u2013 but diff browsers use different hueristics for how long they will cache a page before they even bother to do a validation request, that can cause many people to see \"stale\" pages after we do release announcements.\n\nExample: Chrome apparently uses this hueristic \u2013 w/o any upper bound \u2013 to decide how long to keep an item in it's cache w/o revalidation...\n\n(date_item_was_last_fetched - last_mod_date_when_item_was_last_fetched) / 10\n\n...that means that if it's been 100 days since they last time we updated & published a page, when someone loads our website in chrome, their browser will cache that page for up to 10 days w/o bothering to do a cacle-validation request to see if the page has changed.\n\nWe should consider taking advantage of mod_headers in our htaccess file to set Cache-Control: max-age ... headers on various file extensions, and perhaps set lower max-ages (or must-revalidate options) on some of the pages we use specifically for annoucements & releases (ie: news, download, doc landing pages, etc...)",
