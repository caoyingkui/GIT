    "description": "I have indexed documents with lots of different text fields representing different properties in Solr (version 6.6). Those text fields are indexed with storeOffsetsWithPositions=true and termVectors=true to speed up highlighting using the UnifiedHighlighter.\n\nDuring a search, i would like to highlight those properties and I have set hl.fl to wildcard match all properties. Everything is working fine, except that the responses are huge.\n\nEvery document only has a small set of properties (let's say 10 in total, with 1-2 matching ones), but Solr returns in the highlighting section, a dictionary with every possible property (about 10k) for every item. Nearly all of the entries are empty, but decoding the keys of the map takes a considerable amount of time.\n\nIn fact, the time spent decoding this unnecessary entries is enormous. Solr takes about 174ms for the search + encoding (i expect that the timing could be much better) and decoding the response in Go (using the default JSON package from the standard library) takes 695ms.\n\nI guess the offending line is somewhere around:\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/highlight/UnifiedSolrHighlighter.java#L175\n\nWhy is Solr generating map entries for missing values in the first place?\n\nThe question had been posted on stackoverflow before:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/44846220/solr-huge-and-slow-highlighting-response-with-mostly-empty-fields",

You should send your question to the Solr User mailing list, and if it turns out that there is actually a bug in the software, then it is time to open an issue.\n\nPlease see http://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc\n\nAlso, when posting to the list, your problem description could benefit from an example response, highlighting the issue you are experiencing, accompanied with a better description of what your documents and queries look like.

I have already looked at the source and have confirmed that it is a bug, as I have written before.\n\nHere is a simple example to reconstruct the behavior:\n\n1. Create a new core \"bin/solr create -c bug\"\n\n2. Index some documents:\n\nExample Data\n{\"id\": \"D1\", \"prop01_txt\": \"foo\", \"prop03_txt\": \"foo\"}\n{\"id\": \"D2\", \"prop02_txt\": \"foo\", \"prop04_txt\": \"foo\"}\n{\"id\": \"D3\", \"prop02_txt\": \"foo\", \"prop05_txt\": \"foo\"}\n{\"id\": \"D4\", \"prop03_txt\": \"foo\", \"prop06_txt\": \"foo\"}\n{\"id\": \"D5\", \"prop03_txt\": \"foo\", \"prop07_txt\": \"foo\"}\n\n\n\n\n3.
