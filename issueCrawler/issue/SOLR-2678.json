    "description": "It would be nice to have the possibility to specify for some confFiles, if the core should be reloaded when they have changed, and if they should be backed-up when replicating.\n\nBackground: I setup a failover solr server as slave. To have the possibility to switch it to a master server manually, I replicate the dataimport.properties file to have always the corresponding last_index_time for the delta-import in DIH.\n\nBut as this file changes on every new index, of course, the complete core on the slave it reloaded every time which is not neccessary. Also the conf-directory is cluttered up with a lot of unneeded backups of dataimport.properties.",
