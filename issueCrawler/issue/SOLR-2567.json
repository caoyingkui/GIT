In this case, a TieredMergePolicy default certainly does make sense.  I'm not even sure it needed to be linked to luceneMatchVersion... it's a rare solr user that would depend on the specifics of merging or docid behavioral changes. "

I'm willing to respin if anyone thinks its a huge deal. In this case I honestly think our 3.2RC is a good release even though this isn't enabled yet, and we should just target 3.3. "

I didn't really look closely, but from memory, I guess it would disable being able to set compound file? And you wouldn't be able to change the tiered policies settings? Or does Solr's config any given method voodoo work in this case?\n\nEither way, I'd be fine if we didn't respin or if we did.

The only problem is that committers must spend their time to re-review the release candidate, but I suppose if they watch the commits list they can be more confident in their checking and not have to waste a lot of time, since its only this issue and maybe two other small things that were found.\n\nIn fact, Mike committed a \"HuperDuper\" automated-checker to do some of the grunt work of checking a release to luceneutil today: http://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/luceneutil/source/detail?r=5bf3a0ea4922bbeb38a0a16c503b42e07c028eab\n\nSo maybe its a good opportunity to use this utility to aid in easier review of release candidates.

I guess thats because I thought it would be confusing to add \"MP-specific\" settings all piled in to the config. I was planning on opening another issue for this to allow for a factory configuration like other things, especially so I can pass a 'long' random seed so that tests can use MockRandomMergePolicy  "
