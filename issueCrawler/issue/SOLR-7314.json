One has always to declare constants for them by herself (or hard-code them).\n\n\n\t\"defType\"\n\t\"edismax\" (value for defType)\n\t\"dismax\" (value for defType)\n\t\"lucene\" (value for defType)\n\t\"spellcheck\" (there's SpellingParams.SPELLCHECK_PREFIX = \"spellcheck.\", but none without dot)\n\t\"[elevated]\" (pseudo field for the QueryElevationComponent)\n\n\n\nSee http://lucene.apache.org/solr/5_0_0/solr-solrj/constant-values.html\n\nMaybe there are even more, but these are the ones I always stumble upon.\nOf course there are constants in the Solr Core code, but typically one doesn't want to have a dependency on it when implementing a client.",

When users are forced to create their own constants, they miss out on deprecation warnings when features/parameters they're using are sunset.\n\nGoing to push a patch up for this shortly.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other parameter constants missing from SolrJ that we can add as a part of this patch?  This report is a few years old, and as Simon mentioned, there were likely others even back then. ",
