First, it'll get more attention  (more people monitor the user's list) and second we try to keep the JIRAs for known problems.\n\nIf this turns out to be something we need to fix in code, we can always re-open this JIRA.\n\nThis error often means that the packet size is too big and the servlet container is chopping off the packet, but that's just a guess.
