    "description": "Related discussion here - http://markmail.org/message/n32mxbv42hzuneyy\n\nCurrently we check if the same coreNodeName is present in clusterstate before registering it. We should make this check more stringent and allow a core to be registered only if it the coreNodeName is present and if it's on the same node.\n\nThis will ensure that junk replica folders lying around on old nodes don't end up registering themselves when the node gets bounced.",

Or we may want to keep everything behind legacyCloud for all of 5. I would prefer to start doing zk == truth by default - when you don't support pre configuring SolrCore's (As we say we won't in 5.0 CHANGES.txt), most of these changes are really fixing what a user would perceive as a bug.

So for example, on startup, any core that is part not part of a collection in zk should be removed. Likewise, if ZooKeeper says a node should host a SolrCore and it does not, it should be created (given their is a leader to replicate from or when using a shared filesystem). \n\nBasically, all the individual Solr instances should make the appropriate local adjustments to stay in sync with what ZooKeeper describes as the current cluster.
