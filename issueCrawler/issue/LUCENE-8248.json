    "description": "MergePolicy.getMaxCFSSegmentSizeMB is final, but the corresponding setter is not, which means that overriding it with anything other than a trivial delegation can only lead to confusion.\n\nThe patch makes the method final and removes the trivial implementations from MergePolicyWrapper and NoMergePolicy.\n\nMichael McCandless also pointed out that the class name is nonstandard for similar adapter classes in Lucene, which are usually Filter*.java. Personally I was looking for MergePolicyAdapter, but if there is a prevailing convention here around Filter, does it make sense to change this class's name to FilterMergePolicy?",
