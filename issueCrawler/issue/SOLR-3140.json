    "description": "Today norms are enabled for all Solr field types by default, while in Lucene norms are omitted for the numeric types.\n\nPropose to make the Solr defaults the same as in Lucene, so that if someone occasionally wants index-side boost for a numeric field type they must say omitNorms=\"false\". This lets us simplify the example schema too.",

All numeric fields inherit from this and if schema version >1.4 (patch bumps it to 1.5) the new default will be used.\n\nI could not find a way to set this default in constructor, as we do not know yet the schema version, before init() is called, right?\n\nOpen issues:\n\n\tIs there a better place to set this default than in init() in the new base class?\n\tShould StrField or other fields also have omitNorms as default?\n\n "

The user can always switch it of course.\n\nBut on the other hand, the \"string\" type defined by the example schema already specifies omitNorms=true, and as long as we don't change that I don't think the default for the java class is a big deal either way.  Keeping it the same has the slight benefit of making it easier for the minority of people who defined their own string fields and purposely wanted norms. "
