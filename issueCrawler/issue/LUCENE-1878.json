            "content": "removes the deprecated classes -\n\nthere were two public fields declared of a deprecated type - they were not used, so they are pulled in this patch.\n\nSpatial could really use some love - its not in the best shape for its debut - there is no good overview, no package.html to explaining anything, and extremely sparse javadoc. Its in less than great shape for users and maintenance I think.\n\nYou can look at the tests for a little help though. But for someone that just even wants to know if they would want to use it... ",
