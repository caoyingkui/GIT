    "description": "The WordBreakSolrSpellChecker only works if both words that are being broken are in the dictionary.  This prevents the spell checker from breaking in other valid use cases - such as when one of the words has a synonym that is in the dictionary, or when one of the words is misspelled.  I would like to enable (via configuration) the option to break when one of the two words is in the dictionary, but the other is not.",
