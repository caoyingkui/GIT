    "description": "We can improve the current format in a few ways:\n\n\tspeed up Sorted/SortedSet byte[] lookup by structuring the term blocks differently (allow random access, more efficient bulk i/o)\n\tspeed up reverse lookup by adding a reverse index (small: just every 1024'th term with useless suffixes removed).\n\tuse slice API for access to access to binary content, too.",

            "content": "Thank you Ryan. Its more than that actually, we had stupidity at read-time too to handle the empty terms case (this can happen when all values are merged away, and yes we test it explicitly). \n\nI removed the max'ing and replaced with asserts.\n\nI also added new random termsenum tests to TestLucene410DocValuesFormat. These test the termsenum behavior with large amounts of terms (in nightly very large amounts). It would be nice to factor them into the base class to improve testing of all DVF's, but thats a little more complicated and noisy so I left a TODO. I intend to address it after this issue though. ",
