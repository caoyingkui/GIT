The problem here is: E.g., A wrapped slow reader still returns its delegate as core cache key, so the reader closed listener works as expected, when the child is closed. But PMR must not return the inner cache keys, as it wraps them with modifying index contents.\n\nThe problem here is that the leaves are atomic and the field cache does not get the reader closed event. The somehow best fix would be to call readerClosedListener for all childs (not leaves!) on doClose. Theoretically, all CompositeReaders that wrap ll childs of other readers should do this (only Parallel is currently doing this).\n\nAnother idea would be to use incRef and decRef, but that would not affect the wrapped atomic readers, so I prefer the previous solution.

The solution is to leave the construction as is, just in doClose() call notifyReaderClosedListeners() on all subreaders (which is unfortunately private). But this would still not help for tests, because maybeWrapReader tries to hide itsself from FieldCache (this is why it has FCInvisibleMultiReader). Tests almost always close the original reader and never the wrapper, so with this patch the whole thing does not work.\n\nThe test failure is very seldom because it only happens:\n\n\tif you wrap (rarely) with a ParallelMultiReader (more rarely)\n\tuse FieldCache\n\n\n\nThe number of tests with FieldCache is very small, so it took more than 1 year to see the first failure \n\nIn fact the problem for the actual test failure is maybeWrapReader in combination with FieldCache. maybeWrapReader should not use ParallelCompositeReader, if it knows that FieldCache will be used. Unfortunately this is not known before.\n\nThe problem with the readerClosedListener not called by ParallelCompositeReader (with closeSubReaders=true) is real, and only affects PCR, because it creates atomic readers with \"own\" fieldcache key.

I think instead we should fix that test limitation, and then use the original patch (where PCR incRefs the provided readers).\n\nThese are 2 different limitations and 2 different bugs!\n\nIf a user closes the ParallelCompositeReader it must free the field cache, so the fix here fixes a real bug - this bug was found by the test and your new test clearly shows it. Unfortunately my patch is a bit larger because some search/replace in it but actually does not change anything in the logic - it just internally changes a boolean to a 3-state enum. It's mostly just an automatic refactoring!  In fact I was able to remove the crazy comment, because the code is now more clean (the hack with this comment explaing why closeSubReaders was true for the synthetic subreaders is now clarified by the code, which is much better!). The code is actually easier now, its maybe just the patch size that made you think its more complicated. I like the patch more than the hack+comment done before.\n\nThe second bug which is indirectly related here is already solved (the test limitation): The 2nd bug is more about the fact that maybeWrapReader is not side-effect-free if used together with FieldCache+PCR -> thats the test bug and is not fixed by this issue (its just worked around by the grouping code that closes the wrapped reader, not the original reader). Ideally, tests working with fieldcache should call LTC.newSearcher(false), to prevent wrapping and the side effects by wrapping. Alternatively they have to close the wrapper not the original reader (so 2 possibilities to fix this bug). Gruping used the second one, which lead to the problems, because closing PCR did not correctly unlink its synthetic readers from fieldcache. But that was not a test issue. ",

No new enums/whatever.\n\nI think the code is now much easier to understand:\n\n\tIf user passes closeSubReaders=true, subreaders are closed\n\tIf user passes closeSubReaders=false, subreaders are increfed in ctor and decrefed in close (just like MultiReader does, too)\n\n\n\nThe synthetic atomic/composite readers created internally differ completely from the public API. The \"old\" code was a hack:\n\n\tThe synthetic subreaders may not incref/decref, because the inref/decref is already done on the real readers\n\tThe synthetic subreaders may also not close the delegates/wrapped readers. Closing is also done by the parent. The synthetic readers are just a third kind and should behave as if they are not there.\n\tThe bug was, that we prevented in the hack by passing closeSubReaders=true, that they are increfed. As the old code never closed the synthetic readers, that was the \"trick\". The bug here was that because we never called close when the parent was closed, the FieldCache hanging on the synthetic atomic readers was not notified.\n\tThis patch just adds a third (private-only) mode, used solely in ParallelCompositeReader. When it creates the synthetic readers, those are not increfed/decrefed/closed (because doClose is noop). But We can still close them to inform the fieldcache. This is the only correct implementation.

In short:\n\nThe current semantics of MuliReader and other wrapper readers is the followng:\n\n\tif you pass closeSubReaders=true (which is the default setting), the subreaders are not increfed, but close() is called if you close the wrapper. But you can also close the original reader -> it does not matter. This is the pattern well known from FilterInputStreams\n\tIf you pass closeSubReaders=false, the whole thing uses refCounting\n\n\n\nThe problem with the patch and the refcounting is:\n\n\tIf we create a ParallelComposite with closeSubReader=true, we cannot change refcounts. But we do this when we create the synthetic subreaders with Mike's patch. This make the well-known FilterInputStream \"pattern\" no lomger working -> you have to close PCR\n\n\n\nThe patch attached here is functional identical to my last one, it passes all tests (I also added another one with closesubreaders), but much simplier:\n\nThe noop on doClose() is done by anonymous subclassing. I also made the top-level close simplier, because i just added the sequential synthetic subreaders to the IdentityHashSet which is iterated on doClose().\n\nI also added some tests for refcounting and forcefully closing the inner reader and checking that this correctly throws exception.
