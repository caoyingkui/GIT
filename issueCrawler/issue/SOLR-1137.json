I would like to propose a better package naming convention for the DIH:\norg.apache.solr.handler.dataimport => for those that don't fit into any of the other three but don't warrant their own package yet.\norg.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.datasource\norg.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.transformer\norg.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.processor\n\nCreate a test folder and mirror the package names for test classes so that test classes are not lumped into src",

Also, many of the comments indicate that the API is subject to change so I didn't think much of backwards compatibility due to this statement.\n\nregarding the user seeing the benefit, the common end-user won't but from a developer's perspective, it just keeps the code more organized and cleaner.
