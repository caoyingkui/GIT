            "content": "I would also strongly suggest to remove these custom charsets. They are not unicode conform, because they use char codepoint mappings that simply define an US ASCII char for some of the input chars. The problems begin with mixed language texts.\nThis strange (and wrong) mapping can also be seen in the tests: Tests load a KOI-8 file with encoding ISO-8859-1 (to get the native bytes as chars) and then map it. This is very bad!\nThe analyzers should really only work on unicode codepoints and nothing more. For backwards compatibility with old indexes (that are encoded using this strange mapping), we have to preserve the charsets for a while, but deprecate all of them and only leave UTF-16 as input (java chars).\n\nYou are right, to reduce index size, it would be good, to also support other encodings in addition to UTF-8 for storage of term text.

It was in reference to Uwe's comment: \nYou are right, to reduce index size, it would be good, to also support other encodings in addition to UTF-8 for storage of term text.\n\nI think that having other encodings can be problematic. Problems that Unicode solves. But if the idea is worthy of discussion then a new issue would be a better place to house it. \n\nRegarding BOCU it is a patented algorithm requiring a license from IBM for implementation. I gather that it is part of ICU. Not sure if either is a big deal or not.  ",
