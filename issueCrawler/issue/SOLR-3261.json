            "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm attaching a patch that solves this issue. \n\nThe problem was that when an inexistent field occurred in the query, the raw (unescaped) Clause was used, so ExtendedSolrQueryParser failed and then the query was re-parsed with operators quoted.\n\nFor existent but non-allowed fields the behavior was different: all the special characters in the clause were escaped in the first place.\n\nWith my patch, when an inexistent or non-allowed field is found, only the colons are escaped, the rest of the clause is left unmodified. There is the special case of *:*, where the colon is not escaped.\n\nThe patch was made for trunk, but it applies (with some warnings from \"patch\") to branch_3x. All tests pass for me!\n\nJuan "
