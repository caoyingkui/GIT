    "description": "The method removeFromParent of QueryNodeImpl, calls getChildren on the parent and removes any occurrence of \"this\" from the result.\n\nHowever, since a few releases, getChildren returns a copy of the children list, so the code has no effect (except creating a copy of the children list which will then be thrown away). \nEven worse, since setChildren calls removeFromParent on any previous child, setChildren now has a complexity of O(n^2) and creates a lot of throw-away copies of the children list (for nodes with a lot of children)\n\n\npublic void removeFromParent() {\n    if (this.parent != null) {\n      List<QueryNode> parentChildren = this.parent.getChildren();\n      Iterator<QueryNode> it = parentChildren.iterator();\n      \n      while (it.hasNext()) {\n        if (it.next() == this) {\n          it.remove();\n        }\n      }\n      \n      this.parent = null;\n    }\n  }",
