            "content": "Simple patch that adds two methods to OpenBitSetIterator: nextDoc() and next(int). These work just as next() and skipTo(int) with the difference that they return the new docId instead of true/false.\n\nAlso improves the unit tests to test the new methods and moves testBitUtils() from Solr into Lucene. \n\nAll tests pass. I'm planning to commit this in a day or so. ",
