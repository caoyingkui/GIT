    "description": "I am using the UnicodeNormalizationFilterFactory developed by Robert Haschart and have added the jar to my solr/lib directory.  This worked great until i implemented the multicore with the solr.xml file.  However now with the multicore feature in place, solr can no longer find the jar containing the unicode filter.\n\nI set the sharedLib attribute to ./solr/lib, just lib and to /usr/local/solr/lib - all three times I had the same result - it could not find the jar.\n\nWhen I copy the lib directory into my core directory (still with the sharedLib dir set to ./solr/lib) everything works.",
