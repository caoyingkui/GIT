    "description": "Java 7 changed the warnings a little bit:\n\n\tJava 6 only knew \"unchecked\" warning type, applying for all types of generics violations, like missing generics (raw types)\n\tJava 7 still knows \"unchecked\" but only emits warning if the call is really unchecked. Declaration of variables/fields or constructing instances without type param now emits \"rawtypes\" warning.\n\n\n\nThe changes above causes the Java 7 compile now emit lots of \"rawtypes\" warnings, where Java 6 is silent. The easy fix is to suppres both warning types: @SuppressWarnings(\n{\"unchecked\",\"rawtypes\"}\n) for all those places. Changes are easy to do, will provide patch later!",

Previous versions did not complain about that (e.g. compiling 1.5 code with 1.6). This warning simply says, that you should have a different bootstrap classpath with only the 1.6 JDK rt.jar in it, so the compiler can check that the methods/classes you are using are really existing. If you compoile against Java 7's rt.jar this is not guaranteed.\n\nThe warning is obsolete for us, as we also check java 6 and java 5 (for 3.x). ",
