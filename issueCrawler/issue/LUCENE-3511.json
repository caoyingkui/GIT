    "description": "With Lucene 2.9, I used to set the maxMergeDocs to -1 to disable it. (This is also the default). Then, if I were to delete some documents and optimize/commit the index, the deletions would be removed from the index such that IndexReader.maxDoc() == IndexReader.numDocs()\n\nWith Lucene 3.4, maxMergeDocs can be set using IndexWriterConfig. When this is set to -1, the document deletions do not get purged from the index even after optimize/commit.\n\nThis can lead to subtle bugs where the user expects IndexReader.maxDoc() to match with IndexReader.numDocs(). In my case, when I iterated through an index after modifying (delete+add) the documents, I could only see the deleted documents.\n\nUnfortunately I can't isolate this into a small test case. It may have something to do with the size of Lucene records. For a small test case, I did not see *.del files appearing on the index dir. But for the case that failed, a *.del file appeared immediately after delete/commit and the file did not disappear upon commit/optimize/close of the index.",
