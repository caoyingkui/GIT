            "content": "The way you have specified ApplicationIntent is an XML attribute.  In order for that to work, the Solr dataimport handler code would need to have explicit support for that attribute.  That's not going to happen \u2013 the setting is only applicable to the Microsoft JDBC driver.  Because it's not a generic JDBC setting applicable to all drivers, Solr has no support for it.  All driver-specific parameters can be specified on the connection URL \u2013 full flexibility is preserved even though Solr doesn't recognize those parameters.  Attributes like url, user, and password are applicable to a wide range of JDBC drivers, so they have first-class support in the dataimport handler config.\n\nIf you change the \"url\" attribute so that it includes the connection parameter like Shalin Shekhar Mangar mentioned, I believe you will get the behavior you are after.  I found this information using a simple Internet search:\n\n\nurl=\"jdbc:sqlserver://server;databaseName=TestDatabase;applicationIntent=ReadOnly\"\n\n\n\nAs Shalin said, this is a question for the mailing list first.  This issue tracker is for confirmed bugs and feature requests.  Your situation is not a bug, it is a usability question, and actually has nothing at all to do with Solr \u2013 it's a setting on the Microsoft JDBC driver.  Whenever you have something you believe is a bug or want to make a feature request, you should ask the mailing list first, to make sure it's really a bug or that the feature you are wanting cannot be accomplished in another way.
