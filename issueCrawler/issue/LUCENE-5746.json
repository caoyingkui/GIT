    "description": "The abstract class NumberRangePrefixTree only has a DateRangePrefixTree concrete implementation. Obviously an integer/long based subclass would be great too, and wouldn't be as difficult as Dates except for its extra configurability.  \n\nI imagine a user being able to specify the smallest value and the largest value (or pre-fill both based on full ranges of Integer or Long or Float or Double).  When Float or Double is used, it would internally use the int or long representation (e.g. Double.doubleToLongBits). It should have the option of working in fixed-point decimal, or floating-point.  Fixed-point is advantageous assuming the ranges (indexed and/or query) are expected to use multiples of 10 (for example) because then you could configure the cells-per-level to be 10.\n\nThe existing abstract \"NumberRangePrefixTree\" should perhaps be renamed to \"AbstractRangePrefixTree\" thus freeing up its existing name for the feature called out on this issue.",
