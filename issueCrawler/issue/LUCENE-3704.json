    "description": "When trying to manage an auxiliary index to lucene, IndexWriter.java 3.5.0 does not provide a proper hook.  Such a hook (see attached proposed patch) permits us to manage an outside index where we get 1 of our segments in parallel to the lucene segments, and we can keep the same docid offsets within the segment.\n\nWe are attaching a suggested patch that provides an override-able method.  We would like this accepted for 3.5+ if possible.  Thanks.",
