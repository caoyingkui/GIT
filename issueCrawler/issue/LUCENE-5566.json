    "description": "We have a very difficult case to identify whats going on.\nWe have a multithreaded environment where multiple threads are trying to hit the same lucene query and getting different results each time.\nFor eg: Query A has returned 1 result which is running in thread 1\n    And same Query A is returning 0 results which is running in thread 2.\n\nAll the indexes looks fine and if we take the same query and try it in Luke and we are able to get the correct results which is 1 in this case. And we are not able to reproduce it in local environments or staging or integration but only on Production.\n\nTrying to figure out whats going on.",
