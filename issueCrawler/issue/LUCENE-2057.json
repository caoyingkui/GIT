    "description": "TopDocsCollector was changed to be TopDocsCollector<T>. However it has methods which specifically assume the PQ stores ScoreDoc. Therefore, if someone extends it and defines a type which is not ScoreDoc, things will break.\n\nWe shouldn't put <T> on TopDocsCollector at all, but rather change its ctor to protected TopDocsCollector(PriorityQueue<? extends ScoreDoc> pq). TopDocsCollector should handle ScoreDoc types. If we do this, we'll need to change FieldValueHitQueue's Entry to extend ScoreDoc as well.",

I've tried it and indeed TSDC does not need to case to ScoreDoc, but TFC needs to case to Entry. \n\nBecause of that it is implemented with a generic type param. This ensures that both the class implementation and the embedded PQ both work with the same data type and you never have to cast. The problem with the state before was that Entry did not extend ScoreDoc and because of that the generics were unbounded.\n\nI'll commit this soon (waiting for the backwards-tests). ",
