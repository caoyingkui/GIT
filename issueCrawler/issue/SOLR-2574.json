If slf4j is such a great thing, that's ! the way to promote it, you get a build failure because of this slf4j and then go figure out the 'simplest thing that could possible work'[Extreme Programming].\nI'm !alone with the issue, others have posted about it (I'm the one taking the time to post an issue).
