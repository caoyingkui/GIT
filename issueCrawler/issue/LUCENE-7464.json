    "description": "On a Windows machine, I applied a patch to a fresh master checkout that changed the version of a component managed by Ivy.  Then I ran \"ant jar-checksums\" to calculate a new sha1 checksum for the changed jar.  A very large number of checksum files then mentioned line ending changes when I ran \"git status\".\n\nIRC discussion:\n\n12:58 <@elyograg> i guess jar-checksums shouldn't be run on windows.  A whole\n                  bunch of checksums appear to have had their line endings\n                  changed.\n13:02 <@elyograg> I expected only one checksum to change.\n13:04 <@hoss> elyograg: that's odd ... i thought the checksum generating code\n              was done by ant and didn't depend on native line endings ... i\n              would definitely raise a jira",
