However, the impetus is not on me to defend why it shouldn't be exposed, it's on you to show why it is proper to take something that is currently private and make it public just to pass a test.  If it needs to be public for other use cases, fine, but generally speaking, I don't think variables, etc. should be made public just for testing purposes.  That's bad OOD. "

IR is as\ncanonical to Lucene as IW. And calling close on IR will also\ncause numerous errors for users.
