    "description": "While playing around and running someone's example code in the form of a test, I realized it might be nice to run a single test from the ant command line when testing SOLR. To my knowledge, there is no way to do this. So, I googled around and found a nice way of doing it. I'll contribute a patch that allows you to do:\n\nant runtest -Dtest=<fully qualified class name or just class name no package> [-Dargs=<jvm args for junit>]\n\nwhich will run one of SOLR's unit tests at a time. You can also use *'s in the -Dtest= to run many test cases that match the * expression too.",
