            "content": "This patch fixes DirectSolrSpellChecker to correctly forward the frequency data.  Results are now consistent with IndexBasedSpellChecker.  An additional DSSC unit test is also added.\n\nI also changed the method name \"SpellingResult.add(Token token, int docFreq)\" to \"SpellingResult.addFrequency(Token token, int docFreq)\" .  This less-ambiguous method name should help prevent this kind of error in the future.  Note, however, if back-porting to 3.x, it might be wise to add back a deprecated \"SpellingResult.add(Token token, int docFreq)\" method.   This will prevent us from breaking anyone's custom solr spellcheckers... "
