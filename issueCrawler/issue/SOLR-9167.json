The error message about Packet len I've seen when there is too much data in ZK and the jute buffer is filled.\n\n\njava.io.IOException: Packet len1213486160 is out of range!\n\nI see that you tried a query with curl that is different than the one with the JDBC driver. Can you try the following with curl?\n\n\ncurl --data-urlencode 'stmt=SELECT count(*) FROM test' 'http://localhost:8983?collection=test&aggregationMode=map_reduce&numWorkers=2'\n\n\n\nmap_reduce and facet take two different code paths.

Same error log for both modes here.\nCould it be a problem with the transport layer of the jdbc driver?\nI tried to debug the driver, but due to asynchronous connect this is a bit challenging. I did not debug the server component yet. \nIf you have any advice how to proceed, I will gladly contribute in fixing this issue. \n\nTried to start the server on a ubuntu 16.04 and connect to it with same result.

I know that streaming API only works with SolrCloud, but maybe that would allow people to try the JDBC driver also without a SolrCloud setup. Is this possible at all? ",
