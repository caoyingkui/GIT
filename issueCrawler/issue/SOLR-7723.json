Not ideal of course but the CMS site build process is a PITA; it seems this time I don't have the right perl modules and one won't install.  I'd appreciate advise on how to verify the formatting, or wether to just commit any way, knowing I can tweak it using the CMS bookmarklet easily.\n\nThe patch notably removes the past edition & both cover images of the last two editions.  I tweaked the instructions on updating the website for books to be more helpful. ",
