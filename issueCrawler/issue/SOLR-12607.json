            "content": "The testSplitWithChaosMonkey failures increased noticeably after SOLR-11665 was committed. I looked at the logs of a recent failure and here's what I found:\n\n\n\tShard Split succeeds in creating new sub-shards and new replicas\n\tThe leader node is killed by chaos monkey before the new replicas can become active\n\tSOLR-11665 kicks in and cleans up (deletes) the sub-shards in construction including all their state from ZK\n\tThe old leader node is started up again and re-registers the local cores thereby creating state in ZK again. However this time, since the parent shard information was deleted by the cleanup, the state is missing parent and range and slice state is set to active.\n\tThis causes the assertions in the test to fail i.e. either no sub-shards exist or if they do, they are active and recovered\n\n\n\nThere are two bugs in play here:\n\n\tThe async API status of the split shard command is COMPLETED instead of FAILED which leads the test to believe that the sub-shard slice and replicas should exist but they don't.\n\tBy default, our tests still use legacyCloud=true unless set otherwise.\n\n\n\nI'll set legacyCloud=false for this test and open another issue to set this to false by default throughout the test suite.

During shard split, we forward updates synchronously to sub shard leaders and we'd like to return exceptions to clients so that they can retry. However, due to using the parent shard name in the StdNode created for sub-shard leader, the comparison between the current replica's shard and StdNode's shard always passed and the errors were never returned. I've committed a fix to the branch and I'll add a test to cover this particular situation. ",
