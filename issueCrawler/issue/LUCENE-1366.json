How about this:\n\n\nTOKENIZED --> ANALYZED\nUN_TOKENIZED --> NOT_ANALYZED\nNO_NORMS --> NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS\n\n\n\nShould we also add ANALYZED_NO_NORMS?\n\nSpinoff from here:\n\n    http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200808.mbox/%3C48a3076a.2679420a.1c53.ffffa5c4%40mx.google.com%3E",
