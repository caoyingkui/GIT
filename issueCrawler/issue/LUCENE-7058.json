    "description": "Hi!\n\nAt Hibernate Search, we are currently working on an Elasticsearch backend (aside from the existing Lucene backend).\n\nAs part of this effort, to provide a smooth migration path, we need to be able to rewrite the Lucene queries as Elasticsearch queries. We know it will be neither perfect or comprehensive but we want it to be the best possible experience.\n\nIt works well in many cases but several implementations of Query don't have the necessary getters to be able to extract the information from the Query.\n\nThe attached patch add getters to several implementations of Query. It would be nice if it could be applied.\n\nAny chance it could be applied to the next point release too? (probably not but I'd better ask).",

Nicholas Knize you're the release manager, what do you think? "
