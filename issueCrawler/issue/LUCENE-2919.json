            "content": "I would implement this stuff a little bit more flexible:\n\nYou could use a standard Filter to do the split, e.g. TermRangeFilter and use its returned DocIdSet as BitSet (if Filter returns no BitSet, can be checked by instanceof Bits, use OpenBitSetDISI as wrapper - like CachingWrapperFilter). This makes it more flexible, as this Filter again has some code duplication with the other IndexSplitter but is again very specific. A simple tool, let it be an DocumentExtractor, could extract parts of a bigger Index using any filter.\n\nHow about that? ",

The documentation says: If the midTerm is in the index, its document will be in the second index.\n\nI think the test should also be improved to check indexes with deleted documents.\n\nMaybe the Filter could automatically be negated by a boolean parameter to the FilterIndexReader's ctor.
