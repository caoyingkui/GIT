    "description": "I am reloading a core using coreContainer.reload(coreName).  However it doesn't seem to reload the configuration.  I have changed solrcore.properties on the file system but the change doesn't get picked up.\n\nThe coreContainer.reload method seems to call:\n\nCoreDescriptor cd = core.getCoreDescriptor();\n\n\n\nI can't see a way to reload CoreDescriptor, so it isn't picking up my changes.  It simply reuses the existing CoreDescriptor.",

            "content": "I've been reviewing the code around the core reload and it looks like the easiest approach to loading the properties would be the following:\n\n1) In the SolrCore.reload method create a new CoreDescriptor from the old CoreDescriptor. We can do this easily because there is a constructor in the CoreDescriptor already that takes an existing CoreDescriptor and deep clones it.\n\n2) Then call CoreDescriptor.loadExtraProperties before passing it to the constructor of the new core.\n\nI'll put a patch together for this. I'll also investigate the existing test cases for a core reload and see how easy it is to test the properties reload.\n ",
