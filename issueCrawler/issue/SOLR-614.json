People familiar with Solr may know the format but most of what is written is noise than information. For users who are not familiar w/ the format find it too difficult to understand why they have to write it this way. Moreover , it is not a very efficient way to configure .",

My understanding was that the -1 was on changing the solrconfig.xml format now for 1.3, please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIMHO, this patch does not introduce a new format. The format as the user sees it, is the same one used in many places in solrconfig.xml right now and becomes just a bit more intuitive. The code that developers write to initialize their component also uses the same NamedListInitializedPlugin which we are all familiar with instead of the clunky XPath stuff. Backwards compatibility is retained for both users as well as developers where users can write the old way and developers can still use XPath instead of NamedList for initialization and it all just works. If life is made easy for both users and developers and at the same time the changes remain backwards-compatible, I don't see why we should be against it.\n\n2.0 remains distant and getting to a Spring integration will take time. IMHO, that will be a real support problem when users may complain on discovering that they have to write their whole configuration again from scratch, or we provide converters which may fail with custom plugins, or even worse where we may need to support both the old and new formats. I really like the NamedList structure and this issue provides us with the flexibility of having a gradual migration path to a more consistent configuration syntax both for the user as well as for the plugin developer. Any changes to existing configuration will be made post 1.3, no changes right now.\n\nWith all due respect, I ask you to reconsider. "

They will have to stick to this ugly format. So what happens is, components take in an XML Node to parse their custom XML\n\nOne point that all of us accept is that the current format is ugly. Moreover , the NameList format is no XML standard . It is just another response format for SOLR output  . My request is let us please not impose a weird format on component writers .

Within a NamedListInitalizedPlugin, the plugin writer does not have access to the Node and can't use it anyway? The plugin writer just has access to a NamedList. \n\nThe NamedList instance contains everything you can add in an xml. so no more XPath needed .\nFor instance ,the UpdateprocessorChain coud have easily been a NamedListInitializedPlugin . All we need to do is add a method to SolrConfig#getNodeAsNamedList(String xpath). All components can start from there. (of cource the first xpath cannot be avoided)\n\nYes, the latter is better looking, but considering that folks are already forced to use the former, it seems wrong (and asking for trouble) mix and match.\n\nWe are not changing anything here. \n\n\n<lst name=\"defaults\"><str name=\"echoParams\">explicit</str></lst>\n\n\nis not same as \n\n<defaults echoParams=\"explicit\" />\n\n\n\nUnless the component writer explicitly changes his code (which I am not recommending now)\n\n\nThe use case is as follows:\nFor instance in SOLR-561 I do not wish to keep this configuration\n\n<requestHandler name=\"/replication\" class=\"solr.ReplicationHandler\" >\n    <lst name=\"master\">\n        <!--Replicate on 'optimize' it can also be  'commit' -->\n        <str name=\"replicateAfter\">commit</str>\n        <!--Config files to be to be replicated-->\n         <str name=\"confFiles\">schema.xml,stopwords.txt,elevate.xml</str>          \n         <str name=\"snapShootAfter\">optimize</str>          \n         <str name=\"snapDir\">/user/datadir</str>          \n    </lst>\n</requestHandler>\n\n\n\nI wish to have a configuration\n\n<requestHandler name=\"/replication\" class=\"solr.ReplicationHandler\" >\n    <master replicateAfter=\"commit\" \n                    confFiles=\"schema.xml,stopwords.txt,elevate.xml\" \n                   snapShootAfter=\"optimize\" snapDir=\"/user/datadir\"/>\n</requestHandler>\n\n\n\nBut ,it is not possible w/o resorting to xpath . \n\n\nwith this code change. I can do something like \n\nNamedList master = (NamedList )initArgs.get(\"master\");\nString replicateAfter = (String)master.get(\"@replicateAfter\");\nString confFiles= (String)master.get(\"@confFiles\");\nString snapDir= (String)master.get(\"@snapDir\");\n\n\n\n\nThis feature is not going to be a part of Solr1.3. But it may be deployed in our organization as an addon feature. \n\n\nThe second usecase is components like UpdateHandler , UpdateRequestProcessor etc. which already has a syntax that is clean. They can cleanup their java code with no xpath "

With this patch, the chain can just implement NamedListInitializedPlugin and the whole bit of parsing will be done automatically.\n\nSo the whole code in SolrCore#loadUpdateProcessorChains will look like this:\n\nList<NamedList> initConfigs = solrConfig.getAllNodesAsNamedList(\"updateRequestProcessorChain\");\n    for (NamedList list : initConfigs)  {\n      UpdateRequestProcessorChain chain = new UpdateRequestProcessorChain();\n      chain.init(list);\n      map.put((String)list.get(\"@name\"), chain);\n    }\n\n\n\nThe chain will have an init method like this:\n\npublic void init(NamedList args) {\n    List<NamedList> processors = args.getAll(\"processor\");\n    for (NamedList processor : processors)  {\n      UpdateRequestProcessorFactory p = (UpdateRequestProcessorFactory)core.getResourceLoader().newInstance((String)processor.get(\"@class\"));\n      p.init(processor);\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\nSo the chain can create all processors inside it rather than SolrCore creating processors and passing them into a chain constructor.

It is only we who see it differently. So every component has its own different configuration. As long as one component consistently uses one configuration ,I guess we are fine. I have never seen users complaining about the inconsistency between updatehandler/requesthandler config. The fact is they don't care. According to them, an updatehandler and a requesthandler1 and requesthandler2 are 3 different components needing three different configurations. \n\nfor instance compare between spellchecker and dismax. Though they have similar formats uses may never notice it because they have totally different configuration. I am sure there is no cause of a confusion because users never compare these two.\n\nThere are certain well known conventions which are important. such as defaults , invariants etc in a requesthandler.
