Commit indexWriter.\n4. indexReader.isCurrent() returns true.\n\nUsually there is a check if index reader is current. If not then it is reopened (re-obtained via writer or ect.). But this causes the problem when documents can still be found through the search after deletion.\nTestcase is attached.",
