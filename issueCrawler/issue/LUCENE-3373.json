    "description": "waitForMerges can deadlock if a merge fails for ConcurrentMergeScheduler\n\nthis is because the merge thread will die, but pending merges are still available\n\nnormally, the merge thread will pick up the next merge once it finishes the previous merge, but in the event of a merge exception, the pending work is not resumed, but waitForMerges won't complete until all pending work is complete\n\ni worked around this by overriding doMerge() like so:\n\n  protected final void doMerge(MergePolicy.OneMerge merge) throws IOException {\n    try {\n      super.doMerge(merge);\n    } catch (Throwable exc) {\n      // Just logging the exception and not rethrowing\n      // insert logging code here\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\nHere's the rough steps i used to reproduce this issue:\noverride doMerge like so\n\n  protected final void doMerge(MergePolicy.OneMerge merge) throws IOException {\n    try {Thread.sleep(500L);} catch (InterruptedException e) { }\n    super.doMerge(merge);\n    throw new IOException(\"fail\");\n  }\n\n\n\nthen, if you do the following:\nloop 50 times:\n  addDocument // any doc\n  commit\nwaitForMerges // This will deadlock sometimes\n\n\n\nSOLR-2017 may be related to this (stack trace for deadlock looked related)",
