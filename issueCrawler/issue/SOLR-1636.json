    "description": "There's too much functionality in CoreAdminHandler which ideally belongs to CoreContainer. EmbeddedSolrServer clients have no way to easily load/unload cores or merge cores without duplicating all the code inside CoreAdminHandler.\n\nThe goal of this issue is to refactor CoreAdminHandler and move its features to CoreContainer so that CoreAdminHandler is just a thin wrapper over CoreContainer.",
