            "content": "For reference, TimeLimitedCollector was added in LUCENE-997, where TimerThread's functionality is discussed.\n\nWhen we resolve this one, I think SOLR-1735 can be resolved as well.\n\nFrom LUCENE-997:\n\nTimerThread provides a pseudo-clock service to all searching threads, so that they can count elapsed time with less overhead than repeatedly calling System.currentTimeMillis. A single thread should be created to be used for all searches.\n\n\n\nThe opinions about the effectiveness of TimerThread went both ways. For example, in LUCENE-1720, the timeout mechanism works differently, and I wonder if we can apply the same logic here, or something very similar.\n\nInstead of having a static TimerThread, we can have start()/finish() API on TimeLimitingCollector(). start() will start a Thread that will sleep in nanosecs granularity until timeout exceeds. When it exceeds, it raises a flag. In collect() (and in setNextReader/Scorer too, to increase accuracy) all we do is check the flag and if it's on, we fail, just like collect() is impled today. App can call finish() that will signal the thread to stop.\n\nI think it's simple and shouldn't reduce accuracy of current impl (maybe only improve it). Assuming apps don't set timeout to 20 msec, Thread.sleep w/ nanosec granularity should be very accurate. Also, today timeout is counted from the moment you create TLC, but the app may do few more things before IndexSearcher.search() is actually called. start/finish will allow the app to time the search() method (or whatever it wants).\n\nAlso, TimerThread was intended to serve all search requests, hence why it is static, but TLC itself cannot be shared across searches at all ...\n\nThis will solve this issue, as well as simplify TLC IMO.

This would not be more efficient with nanoTime, as its still a system call (at least on lot's of JVMs like on Windows).\n\nSo the thread is much more effective (its only reading a volatile field), so we need some shutdown. Another idea is to change this collector to not call nanoTime or currentTimeMillies on every hit (as hit collection should be fast), to maybe do this only every 1000 hit. The granularity could be a ctor param. This saves the thread and its still controlable how exact the measurement should be. A default of 1000 or maybe 10000 should be fine. Of course on the first collect hit (modulo 0) it should already check the timeout (because lots of queries do most work before the collection of hits). ",

I.e., it guarantees that when the time threshold has elapsed, it will stop the query processing, but it doesn't guarantee how accurate it is.\n\nThe TimerThread was indeed included because a system call on every hit was too expensive. I think that my proposal above, introducing start/finish API on TLC will solve the thread kept alive issue, won't affect performance, and keep TLC's accuracy as it is today (not perfect, but better than 'check every N hits').

In theory System.nanoTime should be immune to this (it's the system's timer and not any notion of \"wall clock time\"), but in practice, I don't think we should risk it. ",
