I mean, beside the fact that we would have to debug it .. the libraries we use are not that tolerant - from D3.js Browser-Support:\n\nD3 supports so-called \u201cmodern\u201d browsers, which generally means everything except IE8 and below. D3 is tested against Firefox, Chrome (Chromium), Safari (WebKit), Opera and IE9. [...]\n\nwhich actually means we can make things work with Shims & Polyfills on IE8 (at least that's what the Wiki says) .. but not below. On the other hand .. if we don't support it .. i'd say we can at least show a message if a user uses such a browser anyway. "
