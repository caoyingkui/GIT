    "description": "There are problems with the solr-cell dependency configuration:\n\n\n\tDespite the fact that the asm:asm dependency was removed in LUCENE-4263, and re-addition effectively vetoed by Uwe/Robert in SOLR-4209, asm:asm:3.1 was re-added with no apparent discussion by SOLR-1301 in Solr 4.7.\n\tThe Tika 1.5 upgrade (SOLR-5763) failed to properly upgrade the asm:asm:3.1 dependency to org.ow2.asm:asm-debug-all:4.1 (see TIKA-1053).\n\tNew Tika dependency com.uwyn:jhighlight:1.0 was not added.\n\n\n\nUwe Schindler, do you have any opinions on the asm issues?  In particular, would it make sense to have an additional asm dependency (asm-debug-all in addition to asm)?",

            "content": "In my opinion, support for .class file metadata in an solr idex is not really a use-case. It is an option for TIKA to extract metadata from class files, but for sure not really useful for the average user. Users that need to parse CLASS files can still add ASM to their lib folder.\n\nI still think: If we bundle TIKA, we should just include those parsers that are usefull for fulltext search. ASM is a very bad dependency, because every major version has significant changes in public classes, which make the jars incompatible to each other. A lot of projects use ASM and so classpath issues are very likely. I had lots of customers complaining that Maven pulled ASM for them in this old version.\n\nFor this reason, forbidden-apis rewrites package names of ASM before bundling. Forbidden uses ASM 5 already, so 4.1 is also outdated (and incompatible to Java 8). "
