    "description": "In SOLR-4680 I put a patch to fix spellcheck for the /spell handler.\n\nThis bug/patch does that and also adds spellcheck to the default /select launch.  I'm putting it as a separate bug because I suspect some people may have stronger feelings about adding a component to the default that everybody uses.\n\nHowever, in Solr we DO expose the spellcheck box under /select, and it does not work, so I really think we should spellcheck should be in the default.",

The reason it has not historically been wired in by default is that it requires schema-specific configuration to make work.  I think this is fine with the /browse handler since all of that is example data schema specific, but /select should stay pretty general, eh? "

We cannot rely on a component named \"spellcheck\", since it may be named anything when looking at a custom solrconfig. You could fire a dummy query and look at the response but that is not very clean? "
