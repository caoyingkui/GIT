One big question is what are the naming requirements \u2013 lucene lets you have a regular field with name 'author' and a DocValues field with the same name.\n\n\n\tthe name overlap may be useful\n\tit would also complicate how we refer to fields\n\n\n\nDoes it make sense to represent DocValues with SchemaField?  Some of the attributes could make sense (defaultValue, required, etc) but many do not (INDEXED/TOKENIZED) etc.  Do we need/want a new class hierarchy?  \n\nFrom the end user perspective, it would be great if you don't have to do anything special if the field is DocValues or regular. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "
