    "description": "This may happen for thread-related errors (for example uncaught exceptions in a non-test thread). Then the failure is reported/ registered to JUnit after the test's rules have completed so TestRuleLimitSysouts doesn't see the test/ suite as failing.\n\nA workaround would be to use specialized test listener... but it's a bit clumsy. It is a very specific corner case; for normal errors happening in the test's thread TestRuleLimitSysouts won't fire.",
