Unfortunately this part of Solr still uses the old and buggy code.\n\nThere is an other issue where all uses of Solr was transformed to use language tags (LUCENE-6978), but this one seems to be missing. I will take the issue and fix it like the other places.\n\nPlease keep in mind, that using \"en_US\" is no longer supported in Solr, you have to use \"en-US\" since Lucene/Solr 5.5.\n ",
