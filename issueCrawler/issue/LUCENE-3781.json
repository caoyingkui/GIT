    "description": "The fix revision 407851  was aimed to remove an NPE bug (\"fix NPE and deletion bugs in ParallelReader: LUCENE-561\") on the value  of  \"termDocs\" in the methods \"next\", \"read\", \"skipTo\", \"close\" of the file \"/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/ParallelReader.java\n\" , but it is incomplete. \nSince the value  \"termDocs\" could be null during the runtime execution, its value should also be null-checked before being dereferenced in other methods. \n\nThe buggy code locations the same fix needs to be applied at are as bellows: \n\nLine 574, 575 of the methods \"doc()\" , and \"freq\": \n\n public int doc() \n{ return termDocs.doc(); }\n public int freq() \n{ return termDocs.freq(); }",
