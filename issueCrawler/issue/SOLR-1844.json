This file format should be more flexible to support comma delimited values.  I came across this because I was trying to use the sample file provided by HathiTrust:\nhttp://www.hathitrust.org/node/180    (named in a file new400common.txt)",

            "content": "On second thought, I think the current behavior is fine because it's consistent with the other filters that need lists of words since they all share the same code to do it \u2013 BaseTokenStreamFactory.getWordSet(...). If any change should happen, it should happen there. I'm fine with this issue being closed as \"Won't-Fix\".  It was easy enough for me to simply replace the commas in Hathi's file with a carriage return. "
