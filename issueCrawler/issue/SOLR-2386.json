    "description": "Currently logically identical filter queries are not reduced to one query, but processed and cached individually.\n\nIn terms of cache \"keys\" the following two, logically identical queries, each have a different key:\n\nfq=id:12345 OR id:54321\n\nvs\n\nfq=id:54321 OR id:12345\n\nInternally both queries should be stored and requested by/from the cache as fq=id:(12345 OR 54321) i.e. the clauses in BooleanQuery should be sorted.\n\nNot sure where this would fit best. Lucene/BooleanQuery looks like a natural place to do this sort, but might be more a solr optimization?",

Lucene/BooleanQuery looks like a natural place to do this sort, but might be more a solr optimization?\n\nThis type of optimization has been rejected for Lucene in the past.\nI'm not sure the benefit outweighs the cost to try and do it for all boolean queries for Solr either, although perhaps a configurable option or a separate qparser might be OK.\n\nOf course one could always sort in the client too.
