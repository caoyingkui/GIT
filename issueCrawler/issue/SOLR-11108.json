    "description": "In SOLR-10920 a WARNING was added when creating a data driven collection with config-set _default.\n\nThat output from bin/solr is quite heavy:\n\n\nWARNING: Using _default configset. Data driven schema functionality is enabled by default, which is\n         NOT RECOMMENDED for production use.\n\n         To turn it off:\n            curl http://localhost:8983/solr/foo/config -d '{\"set-user-property\": {\"update.autoCreateFields\":\"false\"}}'\n\n\n\n Suggest this output instead, avoiding cURL:\n\n\nWARNING: Using _default configset with data driven schema functionality. NOT RECOMMENDED for production use.\n         To turn off: bin/solr config -c mycoll -p myport -property update.autoCreateFields -value false\n\n\n\nWe already have the ConfigTool in SolrCLI, but it needs to understand -c in addition to -collection and -p in addition to -solrUrl to be more familiar.\n\nAlso suggest to move the printout from bin/solr and bin/solr.cmd to SolrCLI at the same time.",

Some ConfigTool development is needed. I don't think we need to add full cmdline parsing to both bin/solr and bin/solr.cmd for the ConfigTool, we can simply pass $* to the tool and let all parsing happen there. ",

I assumed from Jan's comment above that \"bin/solr config\" would work, but that it was missing support for a few options.  Maybe the implied first step is that ConfigTool needs exposed from the control scripts in the first place. ",

Some notes:\n\n\n\ttests and precommit pass on Linux; I aim to test it on Windows later today.\n\tAlong with a port option, I also added a -scheme option for specifying http/https.  If users need more flexibility, they can ditch scheme/port and specify the endpoint with the solrUrl argument instead.\n\tWith the argument parsing entirely in Java-land, ConfigTool isn't smart enough currently to know about any values specified in solr.in.sh (AFAIK).  Really speaks to the value of SOLR-7871 so we can move that code into Java-land too.\n\n ",
