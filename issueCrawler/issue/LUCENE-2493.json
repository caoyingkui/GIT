    "description": "Currently the lucene dev jar files end with '-dev.jar' this is all fine, but it makes people using maven jump through a few hoops to get the -SNAPSHOT naming convention required by maven.  If we want to publish snapshot builds with hudson, we would need to either write some crazy scripts or run the build twice.\n\nI suggest we switch to -SNAPSHOT.jar.  Hopefully for the 3.x branch and for the /trunk (4.x) branch",

            "content": "If we chance the jar file names from -dev to -SNAPSHOT, the same build can be easily integrated with a maven snapshot repository (and tested \u2013 LUCENE-2268).\n\nI'd like to avoid a discussion about the odities of maven, but lets just take as a given that if the artifact is named \"-SNAPSHOT\" then eveytime you use it, it makes sure it is the most recent version.  To be able to test (or have a real SNAPSHOT repository) we will either have to:\n  1. rename the .jar to -SNAPSHOT\n  2. run ant twice, once with the current -dev settings, then again with -Ddev.verrsion=4.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nIn my book, the aesthetic loss of \"-dev\" is worth the gain to let the maven community use (and test!) snapshot builds.  This also greatly simplifies building a test case for our maven files (LUCENE-2268)\n\nThoughts?  Objections?  \n ",
