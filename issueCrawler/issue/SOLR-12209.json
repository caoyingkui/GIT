    "description": "Currently the closest streaming expression that allows some sort of pagination is top.\nI propose we add a new streaming expression, which is based on the RankedStream class to add\u00a0offset to the stream. currently it can only be done in code by reading the stream until the desired offset is reached.\n\nThe new expression will be used as such:\npaging(rows=3, search(collection1, q=\":\", qt=\"/export\", fl=\"id,a_s,a_i,a_f\", sort=\"a_f desc, a_i desc\"), sort=\"a_f asc, a_i asc\", start=100)\n\nthis will offset the returned stream by 100 documents\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoel Bernstein what to you think?",

In these scenarios you can't push down the paging behavior. So there really needs to be support for both pushed down paging and paging using decorator expressions. The functions described in this ticket are the decorator expressions.\n\nWe could also make changes to the search expression to support pushed down paging in this ticket. Or we could create two separate tickets. ",
