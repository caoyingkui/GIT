    "description": "Exposing Zookeeper to every client makes the cluster less secure by exposing internal data to others. it also means we need to give different access control to Solr/SolrJ.\n\nWe have CLUSTERSTATUS API which exposes the state of the cluster. A client should be possibly be able to learn about the state by just hitting that end point. Instead of constantly watching the state it can use an optimistic caching of state (SOLR-5474)",
