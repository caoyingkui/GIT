I would also be good with Lossy versions, but I am unaware of these algorithms. The goal: get the index smaller since I don't need the data in there in UTF-8 format.\n\nString x = new String(\"Store this into a field in solr\");\n\nInstead of something like:\n\nString original = new String(\"A\" + \"\\u00ea\" + \"\\u00f1\" + \"\\u00fc\" + \"C\");\n\n "
