    "description": "This was reported by Vish Ramachandran at https://markmail.org/message/w27h7n2isb5eogos. When deleting by term or query, we record the term/query that is deleted and the current max doc id. Deletes are later applied on flush by FrozenBufferedUpdates#apply*Deletes. Unfortunately, this doesn't work when index sorting is enabled since documents are renumbered between the time that the current max doc id is computed and the time that deletes are applied.",

It seems that the issue only affects FrozenBufferedUpdates#applyQueryDeletes and by extension any usage of IndexWriter#deleteDocuments(Query... queries).  Other types of deletions/updates (by term or doc values update) are not affected and work as expected with index sorting. ",
