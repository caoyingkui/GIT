It is not in case of distrib.singlePass.\nPatch works on purpose instead, because that is really whats controlling the things in QueryComponent. So now purpose is distributed in the shard-requests.

            "content": "As you noted, the ExpandComponent relied on whether IDs were present to detect whether it needs to operate but it should have relied on the \"expand=true\" param to do that as other components do.\n\nPatch uses modifyRequest method in ExpandComponent to send expand=true to shards only if either distrib.singlePass=true or purpose is GET_FIELDS.
