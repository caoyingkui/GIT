    "description": "I was going through examples, and realized that spatial capabilities aren't exposed via examples very well. Currently, the examples (techproducts or films) don't even have an RPT field in the schema.\n\nThere's a nice geonames dataset (geonames.org) that could be ingested into a collection and powered off a spatial field as an example (similar to films). There could be other datasets as well.\n\nThe benefit would be ease of use to users who could try out the spatial queries right off the back of an install without having to ingest their own data in order to try out all that lucene/solr spatial provides.",
