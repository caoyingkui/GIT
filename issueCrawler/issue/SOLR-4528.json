    "description": "Currently it is possible to just start creating shards on nodes with the admin interface without creating the collection first with the API. This way of working creates a collection with having numShards = null in the zookeeper config and giving trouble on updates. It would be great to have a numShards field when creating the first shard/node of a collection.",
