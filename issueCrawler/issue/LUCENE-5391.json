            "content": "I understand why \"index.php\" is not broken up: the <URL> rule matches \"index.ph\", but the <ALPHANUM> rule has a longer match, so it wins.\n\nConversely, <ALPHANUM> does not match \"index2.php\" (likely because the [number][period] sequence is not allowed), so the shorter <URL> match is tokenized.  \n\nAnother improperly broken-up filename-looking thing: \"index-h.php\" - the <URL> rule matches \"index-h.ph\", but the <ALPHANUM> rule doesn't match (likely because of the hyphen).\n\nI think the fix here is to disallow  <URL>s when there is no trailing port, path, query or fragment, and the following character is [-A-Za-z0-9] (allowable domain label characters).\n\nI'll make a patch.
