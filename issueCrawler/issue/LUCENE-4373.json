    "description": "It's great that BBoxStrategy has sophisticated shape area similarity based on bounding box, but I think that doesn't have to preclude having a non-rectangular query shape.  The bbox to bbox query implemented already is probably pretty pretty fast as can work by numeric range queries, but I'd like this to be the first stage of which the 2nd is a FieldCache based comparison to the query shape if it's not a rectangle.",

Perhaps something like this:\n\n  public ValueSource makeValueSource(SpatialArgs args) {\n    Shape shape = args.getShape();\n    double queryPowerFactor = 1;\n    if (!(shape instanceof Rectangle)) {\n      double queryBBoxArea = shape.getBoundingBox().getArea(ctx);\n      double queryArea = shape.getArea(ctx);\n      if (queryBBoxArea != 0)\n        queryPowerFactor = queryArea / queryBBoxArea;\n    }\n    return new BBoxSimilarityValueSource(\n        this, new AreaSimilarity(shape.getBoundingBox(), queryPower * queryPowerFactor, targetPower));\n  }\n\n ",
