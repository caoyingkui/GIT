Thanks for the bug report. \n\nIt would really help if you be more verbose in the description, such as disclosing the steps for adding the filter and exactly which exception was thrown.\n\nWould you happen to be able to upload a patch file for this? You can do this by using \"svn diff >SOLR-5687.patch\" and attaching it here. Don't worry if it is not perfect, the important is to get the ball rolling. "
