            "content": "attached a patch that i plan to commit soon.  Adds text_gen_sort (using same analyzer as text_general ) to both configsets.  in _default a <dynamicField name=\"*_txt_sort\" is also added, while in sample_techproducts_configs this type is instead used explicitly by the manu, title, subject, author fields.\n\n(FWIW: I waned to use it on techproduct's \"name\" field as well, but that broke all sorts of things with how the spellchecker is configured in that configset, because the ConjunctionSpellChecker requires that all of the SpellCheckers it wraps use query analyzers that are == ... so IIUC effectively they must have the exact same <fieldType/> ... identical analyzer configs isn't actaully good enough?)
