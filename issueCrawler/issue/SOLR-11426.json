The code I put in the method that's failing (check10) tries to add another document to the core if it doesn't find the 10 it should the first time. If it had come back with finding 11 documents I could (possibly) point to SOLR-11035 and the like.\n\nBut the single doc that I added is the only one found, proving that the core is OK. That is I'm able to see the new doc added to the core, but the 10 added before closing the core aren't there. Have to try something else... ",

I expected that just the normal core closing would issue a commit, and it seems to, just not all the time apparently Which means there's some circumstance where a core could lose documents that haven't been committed when it is closed.\n\nSo the underlying issue is (apparently) there is some condition where uncommitted changes are not committed on a core close. I'll be looking some more, but would certainly welcome any ideas/help.\n\nMeanwhile I'll leave the code in for a bit just to see if I'm getting (un)lucky with this test and happening to succeed for a few days. If it continues to succeed through tonight I'll revert tomorrow and insure it comes back. ",

I'll add\n\nDirectUpdateHandler2.commitOnClose = true;\n\n\nat the beginning of the test and see if it fixes it. ",
