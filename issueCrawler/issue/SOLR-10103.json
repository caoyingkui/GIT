The most important number is probably active threads, but if other stats like total threads are available, they could be displayed too.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could be shown on the thread dump tab.  I'm surprised they aren't there now.",

I let them know that the size of their indexes would typically contribute to this column, but I couldn't think of any way to assure them that their thread count was probably not out of control.  I did finally remember the thread dump, but this doesn't count the threads even though it does display them all. ",
