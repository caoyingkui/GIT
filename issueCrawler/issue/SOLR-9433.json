    "description": "When a core fails to be created for some reason (errant schema or solrconfig etc.), SolrCore.deleteUnloadedCore() is called from unload() in CoreContainer in order to clean-up the possibly left-over dataDir and instanceDir.  The problem is that the CoreDescriptor passed to SolrCore.deleteUnloadedCore() will have its value for dataDir set to just \"data/\" unless an explicit dataDir was specified by the user in the request to create the core, leading to an attempt to delete simply \"data/\", which presumably resolves to a non-existent directory under Solr's home directory or some such.\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/branch_5_5/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/core/CoreContainer.java#L974\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/branch_5_5/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/core/SolrCore.java#L2537",
