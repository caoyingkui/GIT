    "description": "due to the nature of FVH extract logic a simple phrase query can put a FHV into a super long running recursion. I had documents taking literally days to return form the extract phrases logic. I have a test that reproduces the problem and a possible fix. The reason for this is that the FVH never tries to early terminate if a phrase is already way beyond the slop coming from the phrase query. If there is a document with lot of occurrences or two or more terms in the phrase this literally tries to match all possible combinations of the terms in the doc.",

Failing that, maybe a separate configurable limit? ",

Sure its still trappy but at least its an improvement. \n\nanother idea (if the user is using the IDF-weighted fragments) might be to somehow not process terms where docFreq/maxDoc > foo%, realizing they wont contribute much to the score anyway.\n\nBut in general i feel like the problem will still exist without an algorithmic change.\n\nanyway +1 to the patch ",
