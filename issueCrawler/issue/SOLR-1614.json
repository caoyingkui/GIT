    "description": "What's the use case? Sometimes queries are expensive (such as\nregex) or one has indexes located in HDFS, that then need to be\nsearched on. By leveraging Hadoop, these non-time sensitive\nqueries may be executed without dynamically deploying the\nindexes to new Solr servers. \n\nWe'll download the index out of HDFS (assuming they're zipped),\nperform the queries in a batch on the index shard, then merge\nthe results either using a Solr query results priority queue, or\nsimply using Hadoop's built in merge sorting. \n\nThe query file will be encoded in JSON format, (ID, query,\nnumresults,fields). The shards file will simply contain newline\ndelimited paths (HDFS or otherwise). The output can be a Solr\nencoded results file per query.\n\nI'm hoping to add an actual Hadoop unit test.",
