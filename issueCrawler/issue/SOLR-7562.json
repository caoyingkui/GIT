    "description": "This is not a big issue, but might be confusing for new users if they do not have the hostname set in their servers. \n\nSteps taken to reproduce the issue:\n1) Downloaded solr tar file to /opt folder. \n2)Extract install_solr_service.sh file\n tar xzf solr-5.1.0.tgz solr-5.1.0/bin/install_solr_service.sh --strip-components=2\n3) run install_solr_service.sh file. \n\nsudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-5.1.0.tgz\nThe above step starts solr with default options. \n4) Stop solr - service solr stop \n5) Change the JMX options in include folder at /var/solr/solr.in.sh\n\nENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS=\"true\"\n6) Start solr again \n\nservice solr start \nif the host name is not specified in /etc/hosts file, following message is displayed\n\ntail: cannot open `/var/solr/logs/solr' for reading: No such file or directory\ntail: no files remaining\nsolr-8983-console.log file in /var/solr/logs shows the following output\n\nError: Exception thrown by the agent : java.net.MalformedURLException: Local host name unknown: java.net.UnknownHostException: SERVERNAME: SERVERNAME: unknown error\nThe error occurs if the /etc/hosts file does not have an entry for SERVERNAME. \n\nSetting SOLR_HOST=SERVERNAME in solr.in.sh also does not help. \n\nSuggestion:\nMay be add a message info message when ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS=true.",
