The problem looks like when awk is called by the start script, that it is getting a different binary than when you run it directly, because of a difference in PATH.  The difference in PATH might be due to a difference in shell \u2013 the shell being used by the bin/solr script (which should be bash) may be different than the shell you get when you log in. ",

            "content": "Hi,\nmost init scripts around there have special cases for various operating systems! Ours just relies on the default PATH to lookup shell tools. But other non-linux operating systems often have special paths for tools with more advanced capabilities. Most init scripts have therefore something like a switch/case construct to set some variables with absolute paths to tools on various operating systems. We may copy one from some other common tools and replace all calls with variables.\n\nE.g. on Solaris most advanced tools are not on default path for \"default users\" (for compatibility reasons with previous Solaris versions), so you need to refer to them absolutely, e.g. /usr/xpg4/bin/awk or use a different name nawk on solaris, which is a symlink to the previous xpg4 path (see https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23823_01/html/816-5165/awk-1.html vs. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23823_01/html/816-5165/nawk-1.html).
