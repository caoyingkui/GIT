    "description": "If the commit frequency is high, and searcher warming configured, sometimes an overlap of warming searchers can occur.  Solr currently detects this and logs a warning message.\n\nWhile normally relatively harmless, multiple warming searchers can sometimes cause thrashing, extending the time it takes to complete warming, and causing a chain reaction where more and more searchers try to warm concurrently.",

            "content": "A bad solution would be to kill the oldest searcher... this strategy could lead to starvation.\nA better solution: allow a <commit/> to fail after a configurable threshold of the number of warming searchers is reached.\n\nDownsides:\n\n\tcommit currently does not fail (unless exceptional circumstances like an IOError)\n\tIf enabled on a master, two different clients doing a quick add+commit\n   could now cause failure.  We could either just recommend it never be enabled for a master, or\n   some autocommit functionality could be added to enforce a minimum wait time between commits. \n\n "
