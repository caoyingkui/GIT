            "content": "here is a patch (pretty big though). I made KeywordMarkerFilter an abstract base class and added two subclasses PatternKeywordMarkerFilter and SetKeywordMarkerFilter. I also updated the factory to support both based on given arguments. I think this can be useful for others as well if they need to make keyword decisions based on more complex logic. ",

            "content": "In my opinion, the abstract isKeyword() methods should take no arguments and use the CharTermAttribute directly (it would then be consistent to the accept() method of the abstract base class FilteringTokenFilter of e.g. StopFilter). We would also need no spare CharsRef, as CharTermAttribute implements CharSequence, so Matcher can handle it directly without cloning.\n\nThe explicit access to the buffer, offset and length is implementation specific to only the one backed by CharArraySet.
