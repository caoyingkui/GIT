So that begs the question... why not make this a request handler instead of a servlet?   A request handler has the benefit of allowing all usual Solr capabilities especially allowing flexible response writing (JSON, XML, Velocity, etc). "

I just copied the code from the jsp and have not really investigated \u2013 it only uses the core to get the ZkController: core.getCoreDescriptor().getCoreContainer().getZkController();\n\nI'm fine with it as a RequestHandler, but this would require more crazy logic in SolrDispatchFilter like we have with CoreAdminHandler.\n\nany thoughts?  I don't use the ZK stuff (yet) so i don't have any opinion, but we need to fix some issues with this to get the new admin UI up-to-snuff\n "
