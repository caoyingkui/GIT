    "description": "Today it's limited to 32, because it uses a separate bit in the mask\nfor each clause.\n\nBut I don't understand why it does this; I think all prohibited\nclauses can share a single boolean/bit?  Any match on a prohibited\nclause sets this bit and the doc is not collected; we don't need each\nprohibited clause to have a dedicated bit?\n\nWe also use the mask for required clauses, but this code is now\ncommented out (we always use BS2 if there are any required clauses);\nif we re-enable this code (and I think we should, at least in certain\ncases: I suspect it'd be faster than BS2 in many cases), I think we\ncan cutover to an int count instead of bit masks, and then have no\nlimit on the required clauses sent to BooleanScorer also.\n\nSeparately I cleaned a few things up about BooleanScorer: all of the\nembedded scorer methods (nextDoc, docID, advance, score) now throw\nUOE; pre-allocate the buckets instead of doing it lazily\nper-sub-collect.",

            "content": "Using a single bit to track prohibited terms seems reasonable, plus a count for required terms.\n\nI don't recall the exact history of the original implementation.  I think it may have been in order to support more complex boolean expressions.  Any boolean expression can be rewritten to disjunctive normal form, which can then be evaluated with a set of required/prohibited mask pairs, one per conjunctive clause.  This is something I'd implemented previously and probably had in mind when implementing BooleanScorer.  A Lucene boolean query is effectively a single such conjunctive clause, since the optional terms can be ignored when evaluating the boolean expression, so would reduce to a single pair of masks.  But, as you observe, this single clause DNF case can be further simplified to a boolean and a count of required terms.  Does that make sense? ",
