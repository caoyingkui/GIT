    "description": "Overseer stats are not reset when a node loses overseership due to a connection time out. If/when that node regains overseership in the future, statistics such as collection_operations/create/errors will resume from where they left off. If, in contrast, a node loses overseership due to a restart, those statistics reset to zero, so if/when that node regains overseership later on stats start from zero.\n\nThanks to Jessica Cheng Mallet for catching this one.",
