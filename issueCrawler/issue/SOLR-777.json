The best way to store domains is reverse component (www.google.com -> com.google.www); it is one of the admitted failures of the designers of DNS to not do it that way.\n\nStoring that in a string field, you can search for revdomain:(com.google com.google.*) to match a domain+subdomains correctly (Note: your prefix query isn't correct, as it would match www.notreallyapache.org).\n "
