This could cause a \"Too many open files\" error if the admin page is loaded a lot.\n\nI've only tested this on 3.2, but I think it affects all recent versions, including trunk.",

            "content": "Michael: thanks for catching this bug!\n\nFWIW: I'm pretty sure this method is only used by the main index.jsp page to include the \"admin-extra.html\" file \u2013 I don't believe it's used by regular usage of the ShowFileRequestHandler (ie: to view the schema.xml or solrconfig.xml files)\n\nso i think only users who leverage that feature (which i suspect is probably not a very large number since it isn't really advertised much) would have been bitten by this bug. (which also explains why no one noticed it until now) "
