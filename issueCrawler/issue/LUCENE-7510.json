    "description": "Hi\n\nCurrently Lucene gives functionality to write index on RAMDirectory or FSDirectory, but I want to write index in Cache.\n\nTo support writing index in cache, how should I proceed. I want to know how to implement my own Directory where I can write and read index ?\n\nThanks\nDhwanit",
