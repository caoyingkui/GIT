    "description": "on the trunk, defType currently defaults to the \"lucenePlusSort\" option, which has legacy support for syntax like \"field:value;sort_field desc\" where the semi-colon character is considered special if-and-only-if there is no \"sort\" param.\n\nthis syntax has proved confusing to new users on at least one occasion, and has been deprecated for a while.\n\nIn 1.4 we should change the default to use defType=lucene and add a note for people upgrading about how to force the legacy semicolon behavior.",
