    "description": "To add new search options for example add case-sensitivity and not case-sensitivity search\nwe need to index same field twice\n\nfor example create field with 2 search options\nWe should create 3 fields\n1. case-sensitive <cs_text> index only field\nnot case-sensitive <ncs_text> index only field\nand storage only field <text>\n\nSo to properly highlight search by index we should use analyzer from another field (we send hl.fl =text  but search by cs_text or ncs_text) \n\nIt's possible to add parameter to per field override highlighter analyzer?\n\nie I want to send parameter\nf.<fieldName>.hl.fieldOverride=<anotherFieldName>\n\nor for example above:\nf.text.hl.fieldOverride=ncs_text",
