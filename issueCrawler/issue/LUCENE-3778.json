I think it would be a good idea to have a GroupUtil (Or another name?) convenience class. I think this could be a builder, because of the many options (sort,sortWithinGroup,groupOffset,groupCount and more) and implementations (term/dv/function) grouping has.",

We should strive to have\nless, not more, ambiguity in all of our APIs.\n\nBut, since others seem to love it, as a compromise, can you write all\nconsumption of the cancerous chaining as if the methods did not chain?\nIe minimize the cancer: contain it to the API definition, alone.\n\nThe litmus test is then simple: if I were to change all methods to\nreturn void instead, everything should compile / tests should pass.\n\nOtherwise, the patch looks great!\n\nOne can actually use GroupingSearch in a shard'd env, on each shard,\nright?  It's just that then you merge them like normal on the front\nend (ie, TopGroups.merge).  Is that the only reason for the \"... in a\nnon distributed environment\" javadoc warning?\n\nI think the jdocs for each ctor should explain what kind of grouping\nimpl will be used (ie, the ctor taking Filter groupEndDocs uses\nsingle-pass block collector, and requires you indexed doc blocks).\n\nMaybe the ctor should take docValuesType / diskResidentValues, instead\nof setters to change it?  Ie, so that you are stating up front what\nsource to group by (DocValues, FC (Term), function, block).\n\nMaybe you should pass the groupSort, groupsOffset, groupsLimit to the\nsearch method (instead of setters)?

Is that the only reason for the \"... in a\nnon distributed environment\" javadoc warning?\nIn a sharded env one needs to first execute all the first pass collector on all shards, merge the returned search groups, execute the second pass search (with the top N merged search groups as argument) on most of the shards and finally merge the TopGroups from all shards into a topN TopGroups. Also grouping by docblock and grouping features like allGroups and groupHead don't work in a normal sharded environment (unless you partition the groups properly). The docs caching also only makes sense when performing grouping on a local index. This usage is very different then non distributed grouping, that is why I think it is better to have a separate grouping convenience class for distributed grouping (DistributedGroupSearch?). \n\nMaybe the ctor should take docValuesType / diskResidentValues\nMakes sense!\n\nMaybe you should pass the groupSort, groupsOffset, groupsLimit to the search method (instead of setters)?\nMaybe we just should have defaults for these options?
