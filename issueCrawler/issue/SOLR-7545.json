            "content": "I'm pretty sure that defaulting to localhost with no other input is a bad idea.  SolrCloud uses Java methods to find its own IP address, which I believe normally defaults to the first IP address it finds on the system that's not assigned to a loopback interface.  This allows a multi-host cloud to work without configuring hostnames on each system as long as there's only one IP address on each one.  If you change that to localhost, then a multi-host cloud will no longer function unless the user explicitly configures the hostname on every system, which would be a serious regression. ",

            "content": "The point of this patch is just to remove the hardcoded localhost to the one provided in SOLR_HOST, or else default to localhost. But this is only for connecting to a running solr instance (by use of another variable, HOSTNAME). While starting up solr, the previous behaviour is retained, i.e. use SOLR_HOST if specified but default to IP address based lookup if not specified (by use of -Dhost= param). ",
