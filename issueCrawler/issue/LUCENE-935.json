            "content": "This patch:\n\n\n\tIncludes the latest patch from LUCENE-908\n\tUses the maven ant task <artifact:deploy> instead of <artifact:install>.\n     The advantage is that the metadata files don't contain \"local\" in the \n     filenames anymore. This also solves some problems with the latest version \n     of the maven ant tasks and simplifies the <generate-maven-artifacts> target \n     in contrib-build.xml.\n\tThe macro <m2-deploy> now has a nested, optional element\n     <artifact-attachments> which is used to attach the sources as jar files if \n     possible for an artifact.\n\tThe macro <jarify> now has two attributes \"destfile\" and \"basedir\" which\n     allows <jarify> to be used by other targets like <jar-src>.\n\tThe target <jar-src> now calls the macro <jarify> which makes it possible to\n     overwrite <jar-src> in contrib build.xml files. This is neccessary to include \n     special license files in the meta-inf folder (needed for snowball) or to add\n     additional content to the MANIFEST file (needed for lucli).\n\t\"lucene-parent\" now extends artifact \"apache\"\n\n\n\nNote: I separated the patch into two files to improve readability. Both patches \nhave to be applied. ",

I wish we could just run the Maven deploy target for the nightly build and be done with it (instead of all these ANT gyrations)\n\nAt any rate, right now it is setup to do nightly regardless and the VERSION ID is generated by Hudson, so it should mirror the version numbers for the nightly builds there.\n\nLet's let it run tonight as part of the nightly build and see how it goes.  Then we can decide on frequency, etc. ",
