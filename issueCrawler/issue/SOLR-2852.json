    "description": "The /dist/solrj-lib/ directory contains wstx-asl-3.2.7.jar (Woodstox StAX API).  SolrJ doesn't actually have any type of dependency on this library. The maven build doesn't have it as a dependency and the tests pass.  Perhaps Woodstox is faster than the JDK's StAX, I don't know, but I find that point quite moot since SolrJ can use the efficient binary format.  Woodstox is not a small library either, weighting in at 524KB, and of course if someone actually wants to use it, they can.\n\nI propose woodstox be removed as a SolrJ dependency.  I am not proposing it be removed as a Solr WAR dependency since it is actually required there due to an obscure XSLT issue.",
