    "description": "Submitting the patch suggested by Paul Noble to deal with this issue:\n\nHi all,\n\nI notice that when I use EmbeddedSolrServer I have to use Control C to stop the process.  I think the way to shut it down is by calling\n\ncoreContainer.shutdown().\n\nHowever, is it possible to get the coreContainer from a SolrServer object?  Right now it is defined as protected final CoreContainer coreContainer;.\n\nI wanted to do:\n\n((EmbeddedSolrServer)solr)getCoreContainer.shutdown();\n\nBut is seem I need to keep my own reference to the coreContainer?\n\nIs changing this worth a patch?\n\nEric",
