            "content": "Maybe add a simple toString impl too for the components involved here? In general it makes it easier to understand where the RAM is going, at least if you use Accountables.toString() to look at it. \n\nInstead of adding .values() as the child elements, you may want to also use Accountables namedAccountables method: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/Accountables.java#L100\n\nSo something like namedAccountables(\"dim\", cachedOrdMaps). This way you can see which dim uses which amount of memory? Look at e.g. docvalues or other places doing per-field stuff for some examples. ",
