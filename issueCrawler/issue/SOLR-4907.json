I currently use one that does this, but I bet one included by Solr but do things much better regarding permissions etc. "

            "content": "jmlucjav I agree with Erick, having your script available would be helpful.  Even if it never makes it into the final patch, it can serve as inspiration.  Since it's probably named 'build.xml' you could attach it as SOLR-4907-ant-install.xml.\n\nOn Linux, I have a pretty good init script for older RPM based systems like RHEL/CentOS.  It does need some work to make it more generic and make sure it's bulletproof.  I believe it would also work on newer Fedora systems that use systemd.  It would be easy to adapt to Debian, but I believe that the latest Ubuntu is using upstart, and I have zero knowledge of what to do there.  Hopefully we could find kind souls willing to work on scripts for Solaris, AIX, and other big iron systems.\n\nExactly what to do for Windows is a bit of a sticky point.  If we can find a wrapper whose license allows us to include it, should we do so, or would it be better to ask the user to download one that we support, regardless of the licensing?  I personally use Windows as a client, but avoid using it as a server. "

            "content": "Thanks, I just updated the repo to move solr.in.sh to /etc/default/. In an ideal world the current Lucene/Solr build system would be modernized a bit (LUCENE-5755) and would then allow you to build the RPM + DEB packages along with the ZIP and TAR files which would all be uploaded to the mirrors with a standard release. The nice thing with using a native package installer is that clients can easily uninstall the package if they don't want it and during upgrades old items are cleaned up and removed appropriately since all of the files are being tracked. I personally think it's just one less barrier to entry and much more natural than: `wget http://apache.claz.org/lucene/solr/6.2.0/solr-6.2.0-src.tgz && tar xzf solr-6.2.0.tgz solr-6.2.0/bin/install_solr_service.sh --strip-components=2`.
