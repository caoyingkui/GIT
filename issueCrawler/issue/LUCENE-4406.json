            "content": "There are a few different ways to do it. I can also modify the default text report to include such an information, or we could extract it from ANT test XMLs generated during the run (this can be misleading if there are existing XMLs in the output directory and one runs just a subset of tests). I wouldn't use \"exec grep\" because this isn't always available (windows machines). There is a task for Ant that does it I'm sure (or it can be built).\n\nI think the easiest way would be to include failed tests (or suites?) at the end via an attribute on the text report in randomized testing. Let me know if you'd want it done this way. ",

            "content": "I've worked on the release today anyway to fix the problematic non-allowed XML characters in reports so I added this as well. It looks pretty much like this (the number of failures to show is configurable):\n\n\n[junit4:junit4]\n[junit4:junit4] Tests with failures (first 2 out of 6):\n[junit4:junit4]   - com.carrotsearch.ant.tasks.junit4.tests.TestStatuses.failure\n[junit4:junit4]   - com.carrotsearch.ant.tasks.junit4.tests.TestStatuses.error\n\n\n\nI didn't include the throwable's message like Maven does because it really doesn't make sense here \u2013 if you care about a failure you'll need the stack (and possibly sysouts) too so you'll have to locate it anyway. Btw. remember that all failures are also marked with a \"<<<\" so grepping for this in context may also provide a nice shortcut to locate the full failure string. ",
