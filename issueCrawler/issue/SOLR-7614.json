    "description": "I just happened to notice the following added to FacetComponent:\n\n  /**\n   * Incremented counter used to track the values being refined in a given request.\n   * This counter is used in conjunction with {@link PivotFacet#REFINE_PARAM} to identify\n   * which refinement values are associated with which pivots.\n   */\n  int pivotRefinementCounter = 0;\n\n\n\nThat counter is incremented for each refinement request for correlation, and then reset to 0 at the end.  This will obviously break for concurrent distributed pivot facet requests.\n\npivotRefinementCounter should be moved to per-request storage.",
