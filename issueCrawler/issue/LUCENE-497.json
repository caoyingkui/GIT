    "description": "As discussed in email earlier today, it wouldn't hurt to update the Copyright on all of the source files before release 1.9.\n\nRather then try to submit a path with all the changes, here's a oneliner that should work on any unix box to update in mass.  If it sees a Copyright string it recognizes, it preserves the start year and adds/replaces the end year...\n\nfind name *.java | xargs perl -pi -e 's/Copyright ((c) )?(200[0-5])(\\d+)? (The )?Apache Software Foundation/Copyright ${2}-2006 The Apache Software Foundation/;'\n\n...it would make sense for someone with commit permissions to run that themselves.\n\nIt also cleans up a few that have a \" (c) \" in them that doesn't seem standard across the rest of the files, and makes sure that the ASF is refered to as \"The\" ASF.\n\nEven after all that, there are a few that may need cleaned up by hand...\n\n./src/test/org/apache/lucene/store/TestLock.java: * Copyright (c) 2001,2004 The Apache Software Foundation.

The date in the copyright is the date of first publication.\n\nCopyrights have a limited duration, and changing the copyright date doesn't extend the date they expire.  They last long enough (75 years?) that we shouldn't be worried though.  You don't even need a copyright statement for the work to be copyrighted, but we should have them anyway to prevent the \"innocent infringement\" defence, and because the ASF probably wants them. ",

It's not, they said, the actual form of the copyright notice its convincing a judge that you do hold the copyright.   To that end, I asked, a good copyright notice is a help and a bad copyright notice is a hindrance.   Yes, came the answer. ",
