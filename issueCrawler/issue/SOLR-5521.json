    "description": "When the compared document's unique id is negative, the MoreLikeThis component fails to generate a valid query to pass to each shard, as the generated query does not encapsulate the item's negative id with quotes.  In our case, we are adding documents with a negative id as temporary beans, used just for the MLT query, which will be deleted later.    \n\nYou can see this with a rather simple MLT query:\nhttp://lga-sppsolrprod01.pulse.prod/solr/rawContents/select?mlt=true&q=itemId:-1578997856&mlt.fl=text&mlt.count=100\n\nwhere the returned response shows:\n<response><lst name=\"responseHeader\"><int name=\"status\">400</int><int name=\"QTime\">3</int><lst name=\"params\"><str name=\"mlt.count\">100</str><str name=\"mlt.fl\">text</str><str name=\"q\">itemId:1578997856</str><str name=\"mlt\">true</str></lst></lst><lst name=\"error\"><str name=\"msg\">org.apache.solr.search.SyntaxError: Cannot parse 'itemId:-1578997856': Encountered \" \"\" \"- \"\" at line 1, column 7.\nWas expecting one of:\n    <BAREOPER> ...\n    \"(\" ...\n    \"*\" ...\n    <QUOTED> ...\n    <TERM> ...\n    <PREFIXTERM> ...\n    <WILDTERM> ...\n    <REGEXPTERM> ...\n    \"[\" ...\n    \"{\" ...\n    <LPARAMS> ...\n    <NUMBER> ...\n    </str><int name=\"code\">400</int></lst></response>",

It thus fixes the symptom identified above, as well as the similar problem mentioned in the comments to SOLR-788.    \n\nThe patch includes a test in DistributedMLTComponentTest, although to verify it you have to remove the Ignore annotation that skips the test to accommodate freebsd.
