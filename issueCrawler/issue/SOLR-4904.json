    "description": "This is suggested by Andrzej Bialecki  at bbuzz conf 2013. This makes a lot of sense and works nice with fixing the root cause of issue SOLR-4903.\n\nBasically QueryComponent could send internal lucene ids along with the index version number so that in subsequent queries to other solr components, like FacetComponent, the internal ids would be sent. The index version is required to ensure we deal with the same index.",
