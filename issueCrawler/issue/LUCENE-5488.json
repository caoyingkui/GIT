    "description": "Some Filter implementations produce DocIdSets without the iterator() implementation, such as o.a.l.facet.range.Range.getFilter(). It is done with the intention to be used in conjunction with FilteredQuery with FilterStrategy set to be QUERY_FIRST_FILTER_STRATEGY for performance reasons.\n\nHowever, this behavior is not honored by FilteredQuery.explain where docidset.iterator is called regardless and causing such valid usages of above filter types to fail.\n\nThe fix is to check bits() first and and fall back to iterator if bits is null. In which case, the input Filter is indeed bad.\n\nSee attached unit test, which fails without this patch.",
