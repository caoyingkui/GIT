As long as it's easy and simple enough though... it seems like one of the primary goals of the tutorial should be to give users a feeling of accomplishment  and a feeling of \"this solr stuff is easy to use!\".

For instance, you have to scroll quite a long way in the tutorial to even get to a sample query.  I just want a dumb little page, (ideally, it would actually be the landing page when hitting http://localhost:8983/solr when using the example) that shows me examples of interacting with Solr.  I can click on the link, get results and then introspect what I just did.\n\nHeck, going forward, we could even distribute the example index already built so that people don't have to do the indexing until later.  I often find in my training classes that I get a lot better attention when I do search first instead of indexing.\n\nWho knew such a simple thing was worth so much discussion. "
