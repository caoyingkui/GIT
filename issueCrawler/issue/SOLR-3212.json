    "description": "There's a hack that allows multicore handlers (like the CoreAdminHandler) to use a default built-in list (SolrCore.DEFAULT_RESPONSE_WRITERS) of response writers, but it makes it impossible to use a custom response writer.  Only individual core requests can use custom response writers.\n\nSomehow response writers should be allowed to be registered above cores.  (maybe a bigger topic in making other capabilities of Solr available across cores rather than core-specific?   Or maybe just specific to response writers?)",
