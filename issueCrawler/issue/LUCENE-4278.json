I think under some exceptional conditions, the dir is not closed.\n\nThat would totally make sense \u2013 as i mentioned in SOLR-3634 ...\n\n\"Directory not closed\" - something about this test is causing MockDirWrapper to complain it's never closed - buti don't think this is a bug in the new code or the test. I suspect we have an existing bug where SolrCore initialization failures after the Directory has already been opened aren't closing the Directory \u2013 so we should get to hte bottom of that (probably in a new issue if i'm correct)\n\n...and then later on in that issue...\n\nthe directory not closed problem vanished on it's own \u2013 i suspect SOLR-3656 fixed it.\n\n...but based on your comments, it sounds like what actually happened was that LUCENE-4243 broke the close checks and the test just started being silent about the problem.
