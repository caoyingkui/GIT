Given that we only use the MiniKDC for tests, we should find any places where this could be in an issue automatically in the future.  This seems like a reasonable approach over maintaining more dependencies.\n\tI normalized the version of bouncycastle/bcprov we are using \u2013 that didn't seem to cause any issues\n\tI could not normalization the version of the antlr dependency.  MiniKDC uses antlr2, which doesn't seem compatible with antlr3.\n\n ",

Sometimes on an update you have to add a dependency that was not tickled before, but again, it keeps us honest about tracking and attributing that. ",
