    "description": "Hi Grant,\n\nLucy was VOTE'd into the Incubator per http://s.apache.org/xU. As part of our Incubator migration and to be good Lucene citizens, I'm adding this issue to track decommissioning Lucy Lucene permissions for UNIX and for SVN. I think this is something you can take care of via your PMC chair hat.\n\nThanks very much for your help!\n\nCheers,\nChris",
