After analysis Solr applies the query as phrase query: title:\"water ground\" which requires the presents of both words, etc..\n\nSo, basically  title:water,ground acts in the same way as title:\"water,ground\". There is no way how to avoid phrase query.\n\nWhen value is not in quotas then phrase query shouldn't be used.",
