It should have had a # after solr/\n\nAnother issue is that it points to the OLD UI, perhaps it should stay in the new?",

The cloud tab suffers from the same issue. What we could do is centralise the config for the root UI path (/index.html) such that we can easily change it when we change URLs.\n\nWe should, of course, add the # as you mention, too!\n ",
