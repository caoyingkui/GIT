    "description": "Until https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-7871 is fixed, I suggest to improve current shell scripts. Provided patch:\n\n\tchanges $SOLR_ENV default to /etc/default/$SOLR_SERVICE.in.sh . This is security issue. If solr.in.sh is placed in directory which is writable by $SOLR_USER, solr process is able to write to it, and than it will be run by root on start/shutdown.\n\tchanges permissions. $SOLR_USER should only be able to write to $SOLR_VAR_DIR. This directory should not be readable by other users as it may contain personal information.\n\tsets $SOLR_USER home directory to $SOLR_VAR_DIR . As I can see there is no need in /home/solr directory.\n\tadds -f option to install_solr_service.sh. It should be used to safely upgrade Solr.\n\tadds quotes to unquoted variables\n\tadds leading zero to chmod commands\n\tremoves group from chown commands (uses \":\")\n\n\n\nTested on ubuntu 14.04 amd64, but changes are pretty system-independent.",

The whole point of keeping solr.in.sh in /var/solr is to support multiple Solr nodes per server, such as: /var/solr1 and /var/solr2 ... each will need a separate solr.in.sh ",

I would like to see an upgrade script that does all the heavy lifting for an upgrade, including looking for the include script in the solr home, moving it to /etc, renaming it, and setting the permissions.
