    "description": "When you use the collection api to create a new collection and you specify the \"createNodeList\" attribute to the CREATE command it does not preserve the ordering of the node list and thus does not produce a predictable pattern.\n\nUse case: I want to create a collection with 12 shards (maxShardsPerNode == 4 and I have 3 servers and I specify createNodeList=server1,server2,server3.. \n\nI'd expect to get:\n\nserver1 : shard1,shard4,shard7,shard10\nserver2 : shard2,shard5,shard8,shard11\nserver3 : shard3,shard6,shard9,shard12\n\nBut what you often get is something not that because the list order isn't respected so you might get:\n\nserver1 : shard1,shard4,shard7,shard10\nserver2 : shard3,shard6,shard9,shard12\nserver3 : shard2,shard5,shard8,shard11\n\nAnyway.. Easy to fix.. patch attached..",
