In such a case (hitOOM=true or whatever we rename it to), we should definitely never delete any files for any reason. Leave it to the next writer. ",

So I think we should close the writer (like closedbyinterruptexception in java when state gets messed up), so the next ensureOpen fails.\n\nInstead of a hitOOM-type boolean, I think we should save any exception/error that causes this, and ensureOpen passes it to ACE as the cause. In the general case it will be null. ",
