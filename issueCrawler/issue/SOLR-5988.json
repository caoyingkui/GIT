These are the contents of the SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS,txt/html in lucene and solr folder of the distrbution:\n\n\n# System Requirements \n\nApache Solr runs of Java 7 or greater. When using Java 7, be sure to \ninstall at least Update 1! With all Java versions it is strongly \nrecommended to not use experimental `-XX` JVM options. It is also \nrecommended to always use the latest update version of your Java VM, \nbecause bugs may affect Solr. An overview of known JVM bugs can be \nfound on http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs. \n\nCPU, disk and memory requirements are based on the many choices made in \nimplementing Solr (document size, number of documents, and number of \nhits retrieved to name a few). The benchmarks page has some information \nrelated to performance on particular platforms. \n\n "

The file is formatted in Markdown and is part of the HTML pages of the release, because the build process converts it to HTML.\n\nFinally, the JavaBugs page, can we easily tell which of these issue still apply to Java 7.

Did not think to look for specific release checklist (is it public on Wiki?)\n\nLucene/Solr 4.8 is a special release because of this change to Java 7, so it is on my private TODO list (I am the release manager). There was already a mail by Robert Muir this morning that mentions updating the reqirement page and website, if Java 7u55 proves to not have the superword bug. The testing is going on. Once we had several successful runs, I will start a release candidate of Lucene 4.8 with the updated SYSREQ page.\n\nI will change the issue title to update the SYSREQ page before building release candidates.

I try to update them whenever we find new bugs and issues. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to check that every bug is still valid, so it is better to keep them in the list.\n\nIn addition, we have lots of users, still using Lucene 2.9.x / Solr 1.4.x and Lucene/Solr 3.6.x. For those people we should keep the complete list of bugs, especially to help them if they hit one of these bugs to help them to workaround.\n\nSorting the page by version numbers could be done, yes (like we do for JDK vendors).
