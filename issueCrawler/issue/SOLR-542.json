    "description": "We've got the \"fq\" working in the \"appends\" section (<lst/> element) of our requestHandlers.  We'd like to add other attributes - in particular, the \"fl\" attribute, so that, regardless of query, the user is ensured of getting some minimum set of fields in the results.  Yet, when we a setting for \"fl\" to the \"appends\" section it has no affect.\n\nOn a separate note, when a user specified &fl=score in the URL, the results are those one should get for &fl=*,score \u2013 that is, all fields, not just the score, is/are returned.",
