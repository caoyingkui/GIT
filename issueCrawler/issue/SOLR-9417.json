    "description": "The daemon expression currently runs until it's killed. This ticket will add a new terminate parameter to the daemon expression that will allow the daemon to shut itself down when it's finished processing a topic.\n\nThere are a couple of small changes that need to be made to allow the daemon to terminate on it's own:\n\n1) The daemon will need to be passed the Map of all daemons in the /stream handler. This will allow the DaemonStream to remove itself from the Map when it terminates.\n2) Logic needs to be added for the daemon to exit it's run loop if the topic signals it had a zero Tuple run. The sleepMillis value in the EOF Tuple can be used for this purpose. If sleepMillis is greater then 0 then this signals a zero Tuple run.",

So this is the basic template of a batch job, that kicks off then terminates when it's finished:\n\n\nparallel(emails1, \n         workers=2, \n         sort=\"daemonOp asc\",\n         daemon(id=\"daemon1\",\n                terminate=\"true\",\n                update(emails, \n                       batchSize=250,\n                       topic(checkpoints,\n                             emails1,\n                             q=\"*:*\",\n                             id=\"topic2\",\n                             initialCheckpoint=0,\n                             partitionKeys=\"id\",\n                             fl=\"id, from, to, body\"))))\n\n\n\nThe code above uses parallel workers to iterate over a topic and index the content to another SolrCloud collection.
