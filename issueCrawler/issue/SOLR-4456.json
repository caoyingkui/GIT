Click on \"Dashboard\". An old cached dashboard is displayed\n\nWhat should happen is that once connection to Solr is lost, the whole Admin UI displays a large red box \"CONNECTION LOST\" or something",

I'll try to bring up a hackish patch that we can check if the detection works the way it should .. and if it does, i'm going to put some layout over it and we're done, hopefully *g "

I'm mainly interested in the fact if the 'offline'-detection works properly \u2013 having said that, if you're using the UI, shutting Solr down and try to continue, if a dark overlay containing a white box which says \"Connection lost ...\" appears on your screen?\n\nIn addition to that, my idea would be:\n\n\tRequesting a ressource (f.e. /admin/system or sth like that) to discover if we're back online\n\tIf so, displaying another note saying \"Reload the Page to continue\"\n\n\n\nWhat i would like to do, is: resume the UI where it stopped \u2013 but i'm not sure if that will work out. For that we have to track every single request and try to re-execute it again .. "

If you're not sitting in front of the browser (especially this tab) and you view it again and the layer is done w/o you doing anything? "
