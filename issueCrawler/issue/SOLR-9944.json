    "description": "This ticket maps the nodes function name to the GatherNodesStream. The gatherNodes function name will also remain mapped. \n\nI think nodes is just a better name for this function. Gather was meant to signify a breadth first traversal, but I think the docs can make this clear.\n\nI'll update the docs as well and mention that both function names work, but in the future gatherNodes may be phased out.",
