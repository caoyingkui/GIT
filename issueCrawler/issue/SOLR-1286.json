Looks like some slight refactoring of when that status is logged is warranted.  Also the message \"Full Import completed successfully\" probably should just say \"Import completed successfully\" since this could be either delta or full import.\n\nWanna take another round of tinkering, Jay?\n\nA unit test that tests whether commit is called or executed would be nice, to show the bug and the fix working - but this is straightforward enough that I'd commit as-is.  But unit tests: +1  "

It doesn't matter what I enter as a param for commit, when the finish method executes requestParameters.commit always equals true:\n\nUsing: curl 'http://localhost:8080/solr/indexer/books?command=full-import&commit=false'\n\nThe commit is still occurring. I just woke up and tested, so I'll dig in a little more to try to find out what's up. "

There was a test to see if there was a value set for \"optimize\", if so, no matter what it was, \"commit\" was set to \"true\":\n      if (requestParams.containsKey(\"optimize\")) \n{\n        optimize = Boolean.parseBoolean((String) requestParams.get(\"optimize\"));\n        commit = true;\n      }\n\nBut we had optimize=false set as an invariant so the simple presence of a value (false) caused a commit to happen. Changed it to this:\n      if (requestParams.containsKey(\"optimize\")) \n{\n        optimize = Boolean.parseBoolean((String) requestParams.get(\"optimize\"));\n        if (optimize)\n          commit = true;\n      }\n\nI think that should do it.
