            "content": "Hi Sairam,\n\nPlease ask such questions on the solr-user mailing list before creating bug reports.\n\nIn SolrCloud all config files are stored in ZK. So when you run \"bin/solr start -e cloud -noprompt\" Solr internally starts up a zookeeper on port 9983 .\n\nDownload the current files from ZK , edit them locally and then re-upload them. ./bin/solr zk is your friend. \n\nIn general however Solr has APIs to managed most configs . So you don't need to go through the hassle of doing all of this.\n\nCheck out ManagedSynonymGraphFilterFactory which is specifically for synonyms. Otherwise check out \"Schema API\" and \"Config API\" on the ref guide ( http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/ ) for more details ",
