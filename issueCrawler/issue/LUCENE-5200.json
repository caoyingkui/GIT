    "description": "* <code>HighFreqTerms</code> class extracts the top n most frequent terms\n * (by document frequency) from an existing Lucene index and reports their\n * document frequency.\n * <p>\n * If the -t flag is given, both document frequency and total tf (total\n * number of occurrences) are reported, ordered by descending total tf.\n\n\n\nProblem #1:\nIts tricky what happens with -t: if you ask for the top-100 terms, it requests the top-100 terms (by docFreq), then resorts the top-N by totalTermFreq.\n\nSo its not really the top 100 most frequently occurring terms.\n\nProblem #2: \nUsing the -t option can be confusing and slow: the reported docFreq includes deletions, but totalTermFreq does not (it actually walks postings lists if there is even one deletion).\n\nI think this is a relic from 3.x days when lucene did not support this statistic. I think we should just always output both TermsEnum.docFreq() and TermsEnum.totalTermFreq(), and -t just determines the comparator of the PQ.",
