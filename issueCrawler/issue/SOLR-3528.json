    "description": "The old UI would display tokens that had the same position in the same column.  The new one adds a new column for each position, making it less clear what is happening with position offsets (especially in the non-verbose output)\n\nI think it should be reworked as:\n\n<tr>\n<td>Tokenizer</td>\n<td>\n <div>stuff at pos 0</div>\n <div>stuff at pos 0</div>\n <div>stuff at pos 0</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n <div>stuff at pos 1</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\nUsing a table would also force the layout wide rather then wrapping",
