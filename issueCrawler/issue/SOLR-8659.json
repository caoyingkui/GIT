This ticket is to track items that could further improve the JDBC support for more SQL clients and their features. A few SQL clients are:\n\n\tDbVisualizer\n\tSQuirrel SQL\n\tApache Zeppelin (incubating)\n\tSpark\n\tPython & Jython\n\tIntelliJ IDEA Database Tool\n\tODBC clients like Excel/Tableau",
