All works well when I use:\n\n  /solr-6.6.0/bin/solr start -p 9090 -m 4g -s data/solr\n\nHowever if I cd into the data directory and try:\n\n  /solr-6.6.0/bin/solr start -p 9090 -m 4g -s solr\n\nThen I get no cores loaded and the \"solr.\u200bsolr.\u200bhome\" shown in the UI as my installation solr (i.e. /solr-6.6.0/server/solr)\n\nI thought that \"solr\" may be a reserved word so I changed the name of my folder to \"test-solr\" and this worked.\n\nI'm unsure if this is an undocumented feature (at least I couldn't find any reference to it) or a bug.",
