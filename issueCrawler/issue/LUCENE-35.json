    "description": "If i do an AND search with an StandardAnalyzer the word 'it' (or better IT  \nfor infromation technology ) is cut out by the Analyzer. That is ok. I get no \nresult. But wenn i search for 'it' and 'plus' (plus is not cut out by the \nanalyzer). The result is empty, too. But that is not fine, of cause if i search \nonly for 'plus' i get an result.\nSo, i think if an word is thrown away by the analyzer, this part of the and \nquery should hava no affect to the rest of the search. It should left out by \nthe BooleanQuery.\nI hope it is easy to fix, because it has much affect of search result.\n(I tryed do left out any Analyzer but that wasnt suitable ... sorry for my bad \nenglish)",
