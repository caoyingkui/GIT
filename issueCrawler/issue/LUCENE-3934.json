    "description": "As discussed on the mailing list (http://markmail.org/message/cwnyfqmet3wophec) there seems to be a bug in both the formula and in the way RIDF is calculated. The formula is missing a minus, but also the calculation uses local (in-document) term frequency instead of the total term frequency (sum of all term occurrences in a corpus).",

            "content": "Eh, it's even worse - the paper that we used as a reference is buggy itself  or at least misleading.\n\nFormula 1 that supposedly gives the Robertson-Sparck-Jones normalization of idf should really read (according to its authors:\n\nIDF = log ( ((D - df) + 0.5) / (df + 0.5) )\n\n  or: IDF = - log ( (df + 0.5) / ((D - df) + 0.5) )\n\n\nAs it's presented in the Blanco-Barreiro paper it would be invalid (for some values the argument to log() would be negative).\n\nAt this point I wasn't sure about the Formula 2 in Blanco-Barreiro, because going by the definition it should be a difference between the observed IDF - that is, the one that is calculated in Formula 1 - and an expected estimate based on a Poisson model, denoted as expIDF. Whereas the Formula 2 seemed different... After searching the literature for a while I found another paper by Murray-Renals where a formula for RIDF is presented clearly enough for math-challenged people like me:\n\nexpIDF = - log ( 1 - e^(-totalFreq/D) )\nRIDF = IDF - expIDF\n\n\nSo, to summarize, the Formula 2 in the Blanco-Barreiro paper should look something like this:\n\nRIDF = log(((D - df) + 0.5) / (df + 0.5)) + log( 1 - e^(-totalFreq/D) )\n\n   or: RIDF = -log((df + 0.5) / ((D - df) + 0.5)) + log( 1 - e^(-totalFreq/D) )\n\n\n\nNow, comparing to the original formula from the Blanco-Barreiro paper we can clearly see that it is similar, but it differs in the way it calculates IDF:\n\nRIDF = - log(df/D) + log(1 - e^(-totalFreq/D))       (Formula 2)\n\n\nWhich means that even though they mention the Robertson-Sparck-Jones normalization they don't use it (and neither do Murray and Renals in their paper).\n\nTo summarize, I think the Formula 2 is correct, and our code has to be fixed. Patch is coming shortly, I need to write a unit test.\n(Edit: links were broken) ",
