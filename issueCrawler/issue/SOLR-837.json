    "description": "At ApacheCon Solr Boot Camp training, an attendee discovered the inject parameter doesn't work for the PhoneticFilterFactory.   I stared at it for a while, added some debugging output, scratched my head, asked Hoss wtf, and he immediately spotted the Boolean.getBoolean mistake.\n\nHere's the fix.  Will commit right away, logging the JIRA for tracking purposes.",
