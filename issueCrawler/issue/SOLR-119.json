    "description": "SOLR-80 added support for purely negative queries to SolrIndexSearcher - but this was done at a low enough level that the RequestHandlers don't know when the query is being internal modified, and the debugQuery info is not accurate, you can see this by installing the example setup and looking at this URL...\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=-solr&version=2.2&start=0&rows=1&indent=on&fl=id,score&debugQuery=1\n\n...note the explain issue ways hte document doesn't match.\n\nthis is a fairly minor issue, since trying to get score information for a completley negative query is fairly meaningless; even if the score info were correct it would just say something to the efect of \"1.0 : MatchAllDocs\"",
