On Windows, I put a break point in several places throughout the test, and even after IW.close() is called, I still see that .tii, .tis and .frq are being kept by the Java process.\n\nIs it a bug that we don't close them (in actual code, not test)? They have no references in MockDirWrapper ... ",

If so, I will also rename it and add a CHANGES entry. ",

I wonder if MockDirWrapper can catch that for us though ...\n\n\n    if (noDeleteOpenFile && openFiles.size() > 0) {\n      // print the first one as its very verbose otherwise\n      Exception cause = null;\n      Iterator<Exception> stacktraces = openFileHandles.values().iterator();\n      if (stacktraces.hasNext())\n\n\n\nWhen I debug-traced the failures, I noticed that I never went inside the 'if' even though noDeleteOpenFile was true. I'm pretty sure that openFileHandles is not empty, b/c only MockIO/IIWrappers removes themselves from it. We should at least be able to report those handles that were open but never closed.\n\nI will commit this fix to 3x. I saw same file exists in trunk, so I'll fix it there too and try to catch any other failures. ",

Then MockIndexInput removes itself from the Map. Is it a bug?\n\nAs a side note, and maybe a separate issue, I think we should improve the way MockII/IO interact w/ MockDirWrapper. Currently they access the maps directly, and I prefer them to be accessed via methods. That way we can better track what's going on on failures. ",
