    "description": "DrillSideways.DrillSidewaysResult uses Facets when the query does not filter by a facet, but it uses MultiFacets when it does, and MultiFacets implementation is not complete.\n\nSee: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/0b0bc89932622f5bc2c4d74f978178b9ae15c700/lucene/facet/src/java/org/apache/lucene/facet/MultiFacets.java#L67\n\nSee http://pastebin.com/5eDbTM2v \n\nThis code works when DrillDownQuery.add is not called (when there is no facets selected), but it fails with an UnsupportedOperationException.\n\nPerhaps I'm not using Facets correctly, but I'm trying to figure it out to upgrade from 4.6.1 by my self as I could not find a documentation other than javadocs for facets.",
