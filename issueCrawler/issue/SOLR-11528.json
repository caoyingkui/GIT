I think the reason is that the scheam wich the test method load does not have the 'description' field. the reason is solr/core/src/test-files was also compile to the same floader. so the scheam was not true yet.\ni think we should rename the solr.collection1.conf under solr/contrib/ltr/src/test-files .beacuse other solr/contrib also Named with their module name infort of solr.collection1.conf sunch as langid.solr.collection1.conf  and  extraction.solr.collection1.conf ",
