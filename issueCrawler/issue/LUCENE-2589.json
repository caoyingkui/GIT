            "content": "Attached patch.\n\nJust like for the fixed int block case, I added a MockVariableIntBlockCodec (in src/test), with a stupid variable-sized int block encoding.\n\nThese MockVariable/FixedIntBlockCodec serve as a good example of how one can take any low-level int encoder and turn it into a Lucene codec.\n\nI also increased randomness of the codecs picked for testing, by adding params like block size (for both fixed & variable mock intblock codecs) and the freq cutoff for Pulsing.  So these configurations are now also randomly picked when running tests (= spikes on the monster's back). ",

Nevertheless, would that deprecate all parameters? When I want to use randomized tests but need to force a certain codec that wouldn't work.

I think its better to simplify and use a single seed for selecting all parameters!  ",
