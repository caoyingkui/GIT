            "content": "If you look at the config for the apache jenkins 4x jobs, you can see that problem comes from how the jobs are configured to include hte jenkins build identife in the version info.\n\nthey have the following env variable set...\n\n\nVERSION=4.1-${BUILD_ID}\n\n\n\n...which is then used by the ant target via a command line sys prop like so...\n\n\nversion=$VERSION\n\n\nWhich means...\n\n1) all nightly 4.x builds have been claiming that they are \"4.1-*\" nightly builds (example \"solr-4.1-2013-04-22_10-31-16.tgz\") for a long time\n2) that this jenkins instance (and any similar jenkins or other continuous build instances) that want to create automated snapshot builds from a lucene/solr branch need to have their config updated anytime the version number changes on that branch otherwise they are lying.\n\nProposal...\n\nWe should introduce some simple, optional, \"version.suffix\" type property that can be used automated build systems like jenkins to easily set the build date or build number or whatever as a part of the version number, relying on the info on the branch to set the dominate pieces of hte version, so that a jenkins config could simply run something like...\n\n\nant -Dversion.suffix=\"-${BUILD_ID}\" prepare-release-no-sign \n\n\n\n...and never need to change as new releases are generated off this branch.\n\n(We could even consider setting this property up so that it included the jenkins BUILD_ID by default, not sure if anyone cares about that though) ",
