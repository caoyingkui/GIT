If I recall everything right I ended up using the bootstrapped apriori corpus of LUCENE-626 as training data the last time. Made the corpus rather small, speedy and still relevant for most users.\n\nBut the major caveat is that this patch is a trie and is thus a \"precise forward only\" thing. So that might not fit all use cases. It might be easier to get things going using an index with ngrams of untokenized user queries (i.e. including whitespace) or subject-like fields. \n\nBut I really prefere user queries as using only the last n queries will make it sensitive to trends. That will however require quite a bit of data to work well. A lot as in hundreds of thousands of user queries, according to my experience.\n\nNot sure if this was an answer to your question.. : ) ",
