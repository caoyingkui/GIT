    "description": "There was a question on the user's list about whether uncommitted docs were implicitly committed when a transient core was aged out of the cache. I couldn't point to any tests showing that they were so I wrote one. Uncommitted docs are committed when a core is aged out, but this seems like a good test to have.\n\nI'm not sure this addresses the user's question about commit hooks or not, but that's probably another discussion.",
