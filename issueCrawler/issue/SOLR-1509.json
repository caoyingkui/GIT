    "description": "When a user attempts to use the ShowFileRequestHandler (ie: /admin/file ) to access a file using an absolute path (which may result from solr.xml containing an absolute path for schema.xml or solrconfig.xml outside of the normal conf dir) then the error message indicates that a file with the path consisting of the confdir + the absolute path can't be found.  the Handler should explicitly check for absolute paths (like it checks for \"..\" and error message should make it clear that absolute paths are not allowed.\n\nExample of current behavior...\n\nschema path = /home/solrdata/rig1/conf/schema.xml\nurl displayed in admin form = http://host:port/solr/core1/admin/file/?file=/home/solrdata/rig1/conf/schema.xml\nerror message: Can not find: schema.xml [/path/to/core1/conf/directory/home/solrdata/rig1/conf/schema.xml]",
