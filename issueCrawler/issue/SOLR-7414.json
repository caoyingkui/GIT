As a side effect, only fields belonging to the docs would be returned\n\n SOLR-7414.patch \nThis patch introduces new public API in ReturnFields which returns set of explicitly returned values. This looks cleaner without above-mentioned side effect. I tried using existing public methods in ReturnFields but there is no such method which returns explicitly requested fields. Ideally, getRequestFieldNames should have returned this. Change this functionality would break things hence, introducing the new method.\nLet me know if this can be achieved without introducing any new methods ",
