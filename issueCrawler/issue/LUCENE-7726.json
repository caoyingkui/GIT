In addition, for HTML5, the entity escaping can be left out, if it is unambiguous. This mimics the behaviour most browsers out there always had (because most web devs out there did this wrong). So the produced HTML is valid (HTML5) and also leads to no problems in HTML4 browsers. But we should still fix it.\n\nThe requirement to escape also attributes is a requirement of just Java 9's Javac (which is a bug from the HTML5 perspective, but a good thing, too). ",
