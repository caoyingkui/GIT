    "description": "Following the work on the SOLR-9258, we can now perform parallel text analysis with Streaming Expressions. The first text analysis Streaming Expression is the classify() function. This ticket adds another text analysis function: keyPhrases().\n\nThe keyPhrases expression extracts the key phrases from a text field and attaches them to the tuples. The tuples can then be sent to another Solr Cloud collection for indexing.",
