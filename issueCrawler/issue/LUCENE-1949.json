    "description": "re: FilterManager.getFilter(Filter filter)\n\nFilterManager is using the filter's hash code as the key to its filter cache, however hash codes are intrinsically not guaranteed to be distinct; different filters may hash to the same value. Although the chance of a conflict is hopefully low, given reasonable implementations of hashCode, it's certainly not impossible. When a conflict does occur, an unintended filter may be returned.\n\nI'm unaware to what extent this class is actively being used, but noticed the issue during a code browse and thought I'd at least mention it.",
