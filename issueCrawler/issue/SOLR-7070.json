    "description": "field names starting with numbers aren't working properly in fl, specific example from original bug report related to dynamic field suffixes using a numeric prefix...\n\n\n\nIn solr 4.6, I used to select dynamic fields by exact match, e.g. the below query used to work with me:\nfl=123_PART\n\nBut in solr 4.10.3, the above query doesn't work any more, so I am forced to use a wildcards, such as to be begin with match, e.g. the below query:\nfl=*_PART\n\nThe above query works but returns all dynamic fields that end with \"_PART\", and that results in bad performance as our dynamic fields are stored.\n\nIs there any way to be able to select a dynamic field exactly like in version 4.6?",

Smells like a bug\n\nit's because of the hueristic nature of \"fl\" parsing and support for numeric literals as functions \u2013 eg: fl=123,foo,bar,sum(123,yak) to request that for every document the fields foo & bar be returned, along with a numeric constant of \"123\", and the result of the sum function on the constant 123 and the yak field.\n\nas for why field names like this might have worked in 4.6 but stoped working in more recent versions: probably due to new features being added to fl parsing that tweaked hte hueristic slightly.\n\nwe could probably improve the hueristic to do a better job with field names like this (i've done that for similar situations in the past) but in SOLR-6051 it was decided that documentation was a better choice.\n\nalternatively: we could add a DocTransformer for the explicit purpose to dealing with funky field names (start with numbers, contain whitespace, contain commas, etc...) with a syntax something like...\n\n\nfl=[field n='123_field'],simple_field_name,[field n='field name with spaces & punc\\'uation']\n\n ",
