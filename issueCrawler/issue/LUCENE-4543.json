    "description": "We removed this before because of LUCENE-2828,\nbut the problem there was the delegator (not the lengthNorm method).\n\nTFIDFSim requires byte[] norms today. So its computeNorm should be final,\ncalling lengthNorm() that returns a byte.\n\nThis way there is no possibility for you to do something stupid.",
