    "description": "As of Solr 5.2.1, there's a new admin UI available that has been written almost entirely by Upayavira (thanks!) over the last several months. It's written in Angular JS with an eye towards enhancement/maintainability. The default UI is still the old version, but you can access the new version by going to http://<sever:port>/solr/index.html. There are a couple of fixes between 5.2.0 and 5.2.1, so please use either a fresh 5x checkout, trunk, or 5.2.1....\n\nThe expectation is that in Solr 5.3, the new code will become the default with the old UI deprecated and eventually removed.\n\nSo it would be a great help if volunteers could give the new UI a spin. It should look much the same as the current one at the start, but evolve into something much more interesting and more cloud-friendly. Of course all the new UI code will always be available on trunk/6.0 too, and the up-to-date code will always be on both the trunk and 5x branches.\n\nPlease provide feedback on the user's (or dev) lists about anything you find that doesn't work, or enhancements you'd like to see (or, even better, contribute). If you raise a JIRA, please link it to this one so I can keep track of what needs to be committed. If linking JIRAs is a mystery just add a comment to this JIRA referencing the new JIRA and we can take care of it.\n\nPlease do not attach patches to this JIRA, it'll be much easier to keep track of everything if the patches are attached to sub-JIRAs.\n\nAnd a big thanks to Upayavira for this work!",

But it'd take quite some thinking as to how to make it generic and work across all datasets.\n\nPlease do create a new ticket for this. I'm thinking about a \"query builder\" that allows you to pick from a list of fields to query, then type in terms you want to query from those fields, and it spits out a query string, much like the query UI currently spits out a URL.
