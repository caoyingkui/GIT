    "description": "Looking at the code in TwoDoublesStrategy I noticed SpatialOperations.BBoxWithin vs isWithin which confused me.  Looking over the other Strategys I see that really only isWithin and Intersects is supported.  Only TwoDoublesStrategy supports IsDisjointTo.  The remainder of SpatialOperations are not supported.\n\nI don't think we should use SpatialOperation as this stage since it is not clear what Operations are supported by what Strategys, many Operations are not supported, and the code for handling the Operations is usually the same.  We can spin off the code for TwoDoublesStrategy's IsDisjointTo support into a different Strategy.",

The only two supported operations are:\n\n\tIntersects \u2013 equivalent to IsWithin when index data is points\n\tBBoxWIntersects \u2013 again, equivalent to BBoxIsWithin when the indexed data is points.\n\n\n\nThe distinction of \"overlaps\" with \"intersects\" seems dubious.\n\nThe bbox handling is universally handled in SpatialArgs.getShape() which checks the operation and returns the wrapping rectangle.  So effectively the strategies need not even bother with the whole SpatialOperation concept, at least not at the moment.\n\nMy concern with your suggestion to remove SpatialOperation is that I do think it will return.  I know I want to work on an IsWithin when indexed data is shapes with area.  And it is serving the purpose of SpatialArgsParser parsing out the operation you want to do, which I don't think should go away (i.e. the query string shouldn't assume an intersect, it should include \"Intersects(...)\"  Perhaps the unsupported operations could be commented out?\n\nSeparately, I think com.spatial4j.core.query.* belongs in Lucene spatial.

The Strategy is supposed to be a single facade to the implementation details of how a query will work, including the various possible spatial predicates (i.e. spatial operations) that is supports.  If one Java class file shows that it becomes too complicated and it would be better separated because implementing different predicates are just so fundamentally different, then then the operations could be decomposed to separate source files but it would be behind the facade of the Strategy.  I don't believe that TwoDoublesStrategy demonstrates complexity of a class trying to do too many things.  I absolutely think TwoDoublesStrategy could be coded to be more clear.

Query language requirements shouldn't be passed on down to Strategy.  Instead, the Strategys should have a very controlled list of spatial operations they support and how they are connected to the query parser should be the parser's responsibility.  Requiring direct users of the Strategys to use queryShape.getBoundingBox() seems like a good way to mitigate complexity in the Strategys themselves and we can then do whatever we like in any parsers to make our query languages work.\n\n\nSorry, but I disagree with your point of view.

I think we can come to a compromise.  My goal here is to make it clear to the user what operations our Strategys support at compile time, not through some undocumented runtime check.  That seems a recipe for disaster.  Imagine someone who uses one of the Prefix Strategys and then tries to do a Disjoint operation.  At runtime they get an error and then after some reading through source code they discover they actually need to use TwoDoubles which requires a re-index.\n\nInstead what I recommend is that we rename makeQuery to makeIntersectsQuery.  Then all implementations of that method will only construct a Query for the intersects operation.  We can then add makeXXXQuery methods to the Strategy interface as we add support to all the implementations.  If a Strategy impl supports a particular operation that the rest don't, then that can just be a method on that specific Strategy and not added to the Strategy interface.  Consequently TwoDoubles will get a makeDisjointQuery method.  This way we have more readable code, better compile time checking and less confused users.\n\nHow we map this into any Client / Server interaction or a query language should be the responsibility of those classes, not the Strategys.\n\nI'm going to create a patch to this effect.

Having a check like supportsMultiValued() on Strategys seems like a good idea.

The distance precision is kind of a \"hint\" that is optional.  On the other hand, the shape & operation are fundamental.  I agree putting the operation into the method name does indeed make it clear which operations are supported, which is good for clarity and compile-time safety.  But the compile-time safety is only realized if used directly by client code, not when the client is remote and passes a query string that is parsed and evaluated against a Strategy.  This is what happens in Solr, in some of our testing, and I expect similarly for potential users like ElasticSearch when that eventually happens.\n\nCurious, how do you propose compile-time safety be added to see what shape(s) a Strategy indexes?  And what about multi-value compile-time checks?\n\nNow I think about it, what exactly are the purposes of makeQuery and makeValueSource()? I don't think it's clear.\n\nI'll copy-paste the javadocs for you here:\n\n  /**\n   * Make a query which has a score based on the distance from the data to the query shape.\n   * The default implementation constructs a {@link FilteredQuery} based on\n   * {@link #makeFilter(com.spatial4j.core.query.SpatialArgs, SpatialFieldInfo)} and\n   * {@link #makeValueSource(com.spatial4j.core.query.SpatialArgs, SpatialFieldInfo)}.\n   */\n  public Query makeQuery(SpatialArgs args, T fieldInfo) {\n\n\n\n\n  /**\n   * The value source yields a number that is proportional to the distance between the query shape and indexed data.\n   * @param args\n   * @param fieldInfo\n   */\n  public abstract ValueSource makeValueSource(SpatialArgs args, T fieldInfo);\n\n\n\nYou rightly point out that the javadocs for makeValueSource is a bit vague.  I thought it would be best to leave some wiggle room for different ways of calculating the distance instead of being precise.  Do you think we should spell it out exactly and thus leave no room for alternatives?  In terms of its relationship with makeQuery(), I think it makes sense to effectively fix the Strategy specification to essentially be what makeQuery()'s default impl does now (now as of last night anyway).  So yes, the filter & query's matching documents should always be the same.  Adding documentation to this affect would be good; one has to infer that at the moment based on the existing docs.\n\nHere's an idea: what if makeQuery() goes away?  Why is it needed when it can be constructed by a client quite simply like it is now:\n\n  public Query makeQuery(SpatialArgs args, T fieldInfo) {\n    Filter filter = makeFilter(args, fieldInfo);\n    ValueSource vs = makeValueSource(args, fieldInfo);\n    return new FilteredQuery(new FunctionQuery(vs), filter);\n  }\n\n\n\nIf it goes away, my acceptance level of putting the operation name into the method would be higher since you'd only have makeXXXXFilter without a Query variant.\n\n\n ",

Why is it needed when it can be constructed by a client quite simply like it is now:\n\n+1.  The score for spatial Documents seems like it could be calculated from a variety of factors.  One of those factors could be distance, another could be overlap percentage.  So using ValueSource with FunctionQuery seems to give us maximum flexibility.  \n\nWe can maybe move the makeQuery as you defined to a utility class (maybe with the stored-field stuff) which focuses on providing an easy API for the 90% of use cases.\n\nCan we rename makeValueSource to makeDistanceValueSource so that it is clearer what it does? I'm not really sure how best to handle ValueSources calculating scores from other factors just yet so lets just put that on the backburner.\n\nThis leaves us with only needing makeXXXFilter for each Operation.  I like Ryan's suggestion of using the XXXFilterBuilder interfaces.  It doesn't seem like a huge overhead for Strategys that share logic between operations to have to implement a method and call another, 3 lines at the most.  Reasonable?\n\nThe command pattern isn't a hack, I find it rather appropriate in this case, and I remember thinking it was a brilliant move by Ryan to have used it when I first saw it in Strategy for the first time. The distance precision is kind of a \"hint\" that is optional. On the other hand, the shape & operation are fundamental\n\nI can see situations whereby we do have a mix of required parameters (such as Shape, field name) and some that are optional and only apply to certain Strategys.  So how about we rename SpatialArgs to SpatialCommand? and we document that we will treat changes to SpatialCommand like we would to the Strategy APIs, i.e. we won't be removing / changing things without consideration.  Having the Command also means we can handle bw compat more I guess. ",

It's very existence is largely due to its overlap percentage based relevancy \u2013 pretty cool.

It could work via new BBoxSimilarityValueSource(CenterDistanceSimilarity(...)) (hypothetical implementation to be developed).  And the current one might be makeCustomValueSource with the ability for the caller to pass in AreaSimilarity()\n\tWould a makeDistanceValueSource() make it inefficient to support an inverted distance?  This may be a stupid question but we ultimately want this as the default for a query: LUCENE-4208 \u2013 for example at the Solr layer.\n\n\n\nSo how about we rename SpatialArgs to SpatialCommand? \n\nOkay I guess.

I don't know much about BBoxStrategy but as long as it is possible to calculate the distance between the centre of two BBoxes, then we should be fine with makeDistanceValueSource, right? We can then document makeCustomValueSource as being a generic method which Strategys may define custom behavior for (we can perhaps have it default to just calling makeDistanceValueSource).

Originally I strongly pushed to remove SpatialOperation and use strongly typed methods.  But after considering that a little and dabbling in adding operations to some Strategies, I'm unsure how effective it would be.  \n\nRequiring an interface per operation seems heavy handed since inevitably the consumer will interact with a Strategy instance, not a ContainsXYZ instance.  Equally, having a makeXYZFilter method for each operation in Strategy would seem to simply move the problem rather than address it since many Strategies won't be implementing all the operations (meaning they'll have to throw an UOE) while other Strategies will be implementing many operations.\n\nAs such I withdraw my interest in removing SpatialOperation and instead think we need to focus on documentation to make it clear to consumers which Strategies fit their needs.

Then it a realization hit me: if makeQuery() goes away (the default impl gets used) and the input is a circle and sorting is desired, the distances will wind up getting calculated twice.  The first is for the filter, the 2nd is makeDistanceValueSource called via default impl of makeQuery().  I still think makeQuery() should go away, albeit I have less conviction about that now.\n\nRemember my suggestion of having some sort of object which I proposed be called SpatialSearch that is returned from a method on the strategy?  This would have a makeFilter() and makeDistanceValueSource() instead of them being directly on the strategy.  The SpatialSearch instance is per-search and affords the opportunity to cache intermediate results across method calls.  Ryan told me about wanting to do this for a specialized use-case he has with JtsStrategy (in Spatial4j right now) where he unfortunately resorts to a ThreadLocal work-around to share the results.  I can also imagine a sort strategy for RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy in which the filter is informed it should calculate matching distances in addition to its filtering job, so that they can be retrieved later.  Of course the filtering would be slower the more points that are covered by the search radius, but it's viable for some use-cases. ",
