Ordinarily I might argue that for a test of sorting an empty list, immutability is not a problem.\n\nHowever, LUCENE-2989 switched this exact line away from Collections.emptyList() to what it is now.\n\nSo in this version of the branch_3x patch I've reverted that change and added a comment pointing to LUCENE-2989.
