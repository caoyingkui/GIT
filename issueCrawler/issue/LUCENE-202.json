    "description": "Document.fields() only returns stored fields, not those which are indexed but not \nstored. This is confusing, as there's a isStored() Method which doesn't make much \nsense then. \n\nActually fields() returns all fields only just after Document.add(new Field(...)), even the \nones which are not stored. Sounds confusing?  I'll attach a small program that \ndemonstrates this. \n\nThis should either be fixed so that all fields are always returned or it should be \ndocumented.",

The only fields that are stored\nare stored fields.  Before a document has been indexed, it has not been stored,\nso that all fields are present.  When it is retrieved from an index, it has been\nstored, and only stored fields are present.  That's the whole point of the\nstored attribute, to enable control over which fields are stored and which are\ndropped after indexing. ",

I also added notes\nto all of the methods which return a document from an index saying that only\nstored fields are returned.  I hope this is satisfactory. ",
