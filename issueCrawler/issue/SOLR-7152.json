    "description": "In your update handler, if you put a default parameter for rq=, you cannot override it with no rankquery.  You can try passing rq=, which will override the default value to an empty string, but the QueryComponent will complain that it isn't a valid RankQuery.  Looks like a simple fix to not only check for null but also isEmpty.\n\nPossible workaround for now:\nCheck for empty rq string in the prepare method of an earlier search component and remove it.  This isn't a workable solution though if your rankquery param uses a \n{!switch ...}\n that can set to empty in a default case for example.",
